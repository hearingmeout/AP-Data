The x-axis shows days from 0 to 20 in increments of 5. The y-axis shows relative population density with no scale. Two curves are shown. The solid curve is for P. caudatum and it starts just above the origin on the y-axis. It is increasing and concave down and reaches a maximum about 20 percent of the way up the y-axis around 5 days, then is decreasing and concave down until reaching the x-axis around 17 days. The dashed curve is for P. Aurelia and it starts just about the origin on the y-axis. It is increasing and concave up, has a point of inflection to become increasing and concave down around 8 days. By day 17 it has reached what appears to be a local maximum near the top of the y-axis. \" src=\"/images/8acc1be46a9bfb08a16b019527a163ff.png\"></p><p>The graph above best exemplifies</p>",
