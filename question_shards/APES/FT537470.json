Along the bottom edge the sand percent increases from right to left from 0 percent to 100 percent. Along the left leg the clay percent increases from 0 percent at the lower left vertex to 100 percent at the top vertex. Along the right leg the silt percent increases from 0 percent at the top vertex to 100 percent at the lower right vertex. Letters indicate locations along the inner edge of the triangle. Point A is just inside the lower left vertex. Point B is halfway up the left leg. Point C is just below the top vertex. Point D is halfway down the right leg. Point E is just inside the lower right vertex. \" height=\"424\" src=\"/images/c26acb5757846307d2cb9c3f436c92e1.png\" width=\"460\">\n<p>Which soil indicated on the soil triangle above would most likely have the highest water-holding capacity?</p>",
