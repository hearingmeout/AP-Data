    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\" The figure presents a graph titled Sources of Electricity in the United States, 1950 to 2010. The horizontal axis is labeled Year and has the years 1950 through 2010 indicated in increments of 10 from left to right. The vertical axis is labeled Electricity Production in billion kilowatt-hours and has values 0 to 2,250 in increments of 250 from bottom to top. There are four electricity sources shown on the graph, each of which has an upward trend. Coal is significantly above the other three, which are labeled Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewable. Coal produced approximately 125 billion kilowatt-hours in 1950 and steadily increased until it peaked around 2008 at 2,000 billion kilowatt-hours. In 2010, Coal produced approximately 1,800 billion kilowatt- hours of electricity. Natural Gas produced approximately 50 billion kilowatt-hours in 1950, increased steadily to approximately 400 billion kilowatt-hours in 1970, and then declined slightly to 250 billion kilowatt-hours by 1988. Natural Gas increased steadily from 1988 to the peak in 2010, when it produced 1,000 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Nuclear energy first appeared in 1968 and produced 250 billion kilowatt-hours by 1980. Nuclear energy electricity production steadily increased until 2000, when it leveled off to approximately 750 billion kilowatt-hours. Renewable sources of energy produced about 100 billion kilowatt-hours in 1950 and slowly and steadily increased to 450 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity by 2010. \" src=\"/images/266dafcb13c5c5e8ec18a6b473cc7e02.png\"></p><p>Which of the following is the most valid inference regarding electricity production, based on the graph above?</p>",
