Each watershed has four bars representing, from left to right, Forest/Wetland, Agriculture, Residential, and Commercial/Industrial. The data are as follows: Watershed 1: 80% Forest/Wetland, 10% Agriculture, 5% Residential, 5% Commercial/Industrial. Watershed 2: 10% Forest/Wetland, 10% Agriculture, 50% Residential, 30% Commercial/Industrial. Watershed 3: 40% Forest/Wetland, 40% Agriculture, 15% Residential, 5% Commercial/Industrial.
