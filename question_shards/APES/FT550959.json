The vertical axis represents concentration in milligrams dissolved oxygen per liter water and ranges from 0 to 30, in increments of 10. The horizontal axis represents distance downstream from sewage spill in kilometers and ranges from 0 to 125, in increments of 25. The dissolved oxygen curve originates from the point A at negative 25 comma 8, falls down to the point C at 40 comma 2, further rises through the point D at 90 comma 5 to a maximum point E at 150 comma 8. The biological oxygen demand curve originates from the point negative 25 comma 3, bends downward and rises to a peak point B at 0 comma 28, falls down gradually forming a concave upward curve through the point D to a minimum point at 150 comma 3.
