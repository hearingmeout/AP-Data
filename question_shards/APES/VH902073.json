Step 1 occurs when Nitrogen Gas, N 2, is converted to organic nitrogen. Step 2 occurs when organic nitrogen is converted to Ammonium, N H 4, with a positive one charge. Step 3 occurs when Ammonium, N H 4, with a positive one charge, is converted to Nitrite and Nitrate, N O 2, with a negative one charge, and N O 3, with a negative one charge. Step 4 occurs when Nitrite and Nitrate, N O 2, with a negative one charge, and N O 3, with a negative one charge, is converted to Nitrogen Gas, N 2. The nitrogen gas (N 2) is transferred back to organic nitrogen in Step 1.\" height=\"409\" src=\"/images/50c2332ae037c9c9149e78ad4a2e13b9.png\" width=\"450\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the nitrogen cycle illustrated above, nitrification occurs in which of the following steps?</p>\n",
