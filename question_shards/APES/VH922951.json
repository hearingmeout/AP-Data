There are 4 areas of the diagram labeled with the letters A, B, C, and D. The flow of water through the nuclear reactor is indicated as follows. &nbsp;A containment structure surrounds an object labeled A, that contains control rods. Water is moved in a clockwise fashion through the structure that contains the control rods, through another structure labeled B that is also located within the containment unit. The water flow through both units within the containment structure continues in an endless cycle. A steam line moves from the structure labeled B into a structure labeled C. A pump moves water from structure C back into structure B, which continues in an endless cycle. The structure labeled C is connected to the generator. The generator is connected to a switchyard. A structure labeled D appears beneath structure C, and water is passed into the structure from the exterior, moves around structure D, and then exits to the exterior.\" height=\"433\" src=\"/images/16df76808fbde44fb687d1807a4fcabd.png\" width=\"550\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the diagram above, which letter correctly identifies the step where kinetic energy is converted to mechanical energy?</p>\n",
