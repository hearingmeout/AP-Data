Model A shows the 5 layers of the atmosphere and corresponding altitudes. Beginning at the bottom and moving upward, the troposphere ranges from the Earth’s surface to 11 kilometers. The Stratosphere ranges from 12 kilometers through 50 kilometers, the Mesosphere ranges from 51 kilometers through 87 kilometers, the Thermosphere ranges from 88 kilometers through 500 kilometers, and the Exosphere ranges from 501 kilometers upwards. Model B shows altitudes, in kilometers, within the atmosphere and typical objects or phenomenon that might appear at various altitudes. Beginning at the bottom and moving upwards, jets and clouds appear between 0 kilometers and 25 kilometers and weather balloons appear between 25 kilometers and 50 kilometers. &nbsp;Meteorites appear between 50 kilometers and 75 kilometers. Rockets appear between 100 kilometers and 150 kilometers. The Northern Lights appear between 150 kilometers and 200 kilometers. Shuttles appear between 200 kilometers and 250 kilometers. Reflected shortwave radio signals begin above 250 kilometers and move downward into the 200 kilometer through 250 kilometer range.\" height=\"325\" src=\"/images/4e17c4d4d4a81c55fcaa023edcaadede.png\" width=\"470\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the data in the diagrams, in which layer of the atmosphere would short wave radio signals be reflected?</p>\n",
