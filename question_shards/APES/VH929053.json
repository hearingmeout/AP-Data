      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The water contained in a watershed is more likely to become polluted if the soil has high permeability, so it is important to locate all point sources to reduce contamination.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Watersheds provide habitats for hundreds of marine species, so it is important to protect their feeding and nesting sites when designing housing for humans.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Watersheds provide space for cultivating land to produce food and other products, so it is important to avoid locating a housing development on the most fertile land.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Surface water and stormwater runoff will drain downstream within the watershed boundaries, so it is important to understand the flow of water through the watershed.</p>",
