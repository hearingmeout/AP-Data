There are 3 bars of data per environmental impact labeled Rangeland, Pasture, and Feedlot. The data are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Greenhouse Gas. Rangeland, Relative Value, 135; Pasture, Relative Value, 125; Feedlot, Relative Value, 80. Energy Consumption. Rangeland, Relative Value, 45; Pasture, Relative Value, 120; Feedlot, Relative Value, 175. Erosion Rate. Rangeland, Relative Value, 75; Pasture, Relative Value, 95; Feedlot, Relative Value, 135.
