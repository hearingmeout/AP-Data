Beginning at the bottom and moving upwards, the rock layers are as follows. Rock layer D is at the bottom, and rock layer C is directly above it. Oil is located in the upper portion of rock layer C, and natural gas, or C H 4, is located directly above the oil, still in rock layer C. Rock layer B is located directly above rock layer C, and it contains the same type of rock as layer D. Moving upward, the next two rock layers are unlabeled. Rock layer A lies at the top, and it contains the same type of rock as layers B and D.
