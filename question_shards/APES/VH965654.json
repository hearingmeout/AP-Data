The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and stages are listed as follows from left to right: Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 4. The vertical axis is labeled “Birth and Death Rates per 1,000 people per year,” and the numbers 0 through 40, in increments of 10, are indicated. The three curves are labeled, Birth rate, Death rate, and Total Population. The data is as follows. Note all values are approximate. The curve labeled Birth rate begins at 39 on the vertical axis. It moves slightly downward and to the right through Stage 1. It continues to move slightly downward and to the right through Stage 2. At Stage 3, it decreases sharply downward to 18. At Stage 4, it continues downward and to the right where it ends at 10. The curve labeled Death rate begins at 38 on the vertical axis. It moves slightly downward and to the right through Stage 1. At Stage 2, it moves sharply downward and to the right to 15. At Stage 3, it continues slightly downward and to the right. At Stage 4, it continues slightly downward and then ends at 10. The curve labeled Total Population begins at the lower left of the vertical axis. It moves slightly upward and to the right to Stage 2. At Stage 2, it increases upward and to the right. It continues to increase upward through Stage 3. At Stage 4, it levels out and ends at the upper right corner.\" height=\"234\" src=\"/images/1183081b6a548bdbc7f1f5d344e7a1a9.png\" width=\"555\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
