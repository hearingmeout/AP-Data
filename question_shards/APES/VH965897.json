      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The warm surface water will not change upwelling because this region is at the equator and always has warm water.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The warm surface water will increase upwelling because of the difference in salinity between the warm surface water and the cold deep water.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The warm surface water will decrease upwelling because the cooler temperatures on land in the region will prevent upwelling.</p>",
