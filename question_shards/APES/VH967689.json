She set up high-volume air samplers 10 meters from each edge of the square field and collected samples weekly for two months. When she looked at her data, she was surprised by how much the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P M\"><math alttext=\"P M\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>PM</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> levels varied, both from site to site on a given date and over time at each site.
