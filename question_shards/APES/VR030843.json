    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators collect enormous amounts of particulate matter (coal ash) at coal-burning power plants. Which of the following best describes an environmental disadvantage of using industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators for pollution abatement?</p>\n",
    "answer": "i1",
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Coal ash contains toxic levels of several different pollutants, so when it is collected and stored long-term in coal ash ponds, there is increased risk of exposure to toxic metals.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Coal ash is highly flammable, and it is very hazardous to ship the materials to hazardous waste landfills.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators cannot remove fine particles like dust and smoke from the waste, so a secondary measure must be used.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators are very costly to install and increase the cost of operating coal-burning power plants, leading to increased costs for consumers.</p>",
