    "answer": "i2",
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased melting of permafrost increases Earth’s ability to absorb methane gas, which decreases greenhouse warming and decreases the melting of permafrost.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased global temperatures lead to decreased sea ice coverage and decreased albedo, which further increases global temperatures.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased evaporation and cloud formation decreases the amount of solar energy reaching the surface of Earth, which leads to cooler temperatures at the surface and decreased evaporation and cloud formation.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased precipitation increases the size of high albedo snowpack in polar regions, which leads to increased habitat for Arctic organisms such as polar bears.</p>",
