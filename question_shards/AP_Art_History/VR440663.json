The plan is rectangular, where the vertical sides are longer than the horizontal sides. The plan is divided into two sections, an upper section and a lower section. The upper two thirds of the plan show a series of vertical lines composed of dots that extend from the left side of the plan to the right of the plan. Toward the center of this section is a vertical line composed of thick dashes. There are three horizontal lines, each comprising a different symbol. The lines are drawn just above the center of this section, just below the center of this section, and at the bottom of this section. Along the interior wall at the top, there is a defined rectangular structure with an arch. The lower third of the plan shows a mostly open space. Thin dashed lines are drawn, dividing the space into three areas. Entrances and a small, square structure are shown along the border wall at the bottom.\" height=\"388\" src=\"/images/03562858b0db3cdaf01e61f4f2b1511d.png\" width=\"250\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The repetition of architectural elements in the Great Mosque at Córdoba, evident in the plan shown, indicates how the design could do which of the following as it was expanded over time?</p>\n",
