Green grass, bushes, and trees are shown around the field. On the right side of the painting is a tall, thin, dark green tree that extends almost to the top of the painting. The tree is wider at the base and tapers almost to a point at its top. Beyond the field, there are blue hills and mountains. The sky is painted with flowing white and light blue clouds. Throughout, the paint appears to have been applied thickly, such that the texture of the paint and the brush strokes in some areas appear visible. Most of the brush strokes used in the painting are curved, which is especially noticeable in the sky.\" height=\"317\" src=\"/images/ee79289322ba6c908edceaef94745fff.png\" width=\"400\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, the Annenberg Foundation, Gift, 1993</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The work shown can be attributed to which of the following artists?</p>\n",
