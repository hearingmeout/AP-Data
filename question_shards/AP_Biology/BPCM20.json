    "prompt": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 16px;\">A cell signaling pathway begins when a hormone binds to its receptor. After binding, relay molecules within the cell become activated and trigger cellular responses. When drug K is added to cells, the cellular response is heightened and prolonged.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following mechanisms best explains how drug K increases the cellular response?</p>\n",
