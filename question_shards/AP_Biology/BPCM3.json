Diagram of the formation of maltose</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Diagram of a reaction equation using structural formulas. The reaction shows glucose plus glucose yields maltose plus H 2 O. The equation has the following structure. On the left side of the equation are 2 identical glucose molecules. Each molecule is a hexagonal ring consisting of 1 oxygen and 5 carbons. Moving clockwise from right, each carbon in the ring is single-bonded to the following. C1: H above, O H below. C2: H above, O H below. C3: O H above, H below. C4: H above, O H below. C5: C H 2 O H above, H below. On the right side of the equation is maltose and H 2 O. Maltose consists of 2 single-bonded, hexagonal rings, each single bonded to a shared O. Each ring is identical to glucose with the following exceptions. O H is removed from C 1 on the first glucose molecule and H is removed from O H single-bonded to C 4 on the second glucose molecule. The two adjacent C atoms are each then single bonded to the shared O.\" class=\"lrn-image-center\" height=\"119\" src=\"/images/21d6e9b9cd700f841324923a69cd10db.jpg\" width=\"500\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Aptos Display&quot;,sans-serif\"></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following statements best describes the molecular changes that occur during the reaction shown in Figure 1?</p>\n",
