The horizontal axis is labeled Number of Females in the Population. It ranges from 0 to 1,250. The vertical axis is labeled Eggs Produced per Day per Female. It ranges from 0 to 12,500. All values are approximate. The scatterplot has 81 data points. The data points are in an exponential pattern trending down from left to right. For populations with 250 females or fewer there are 28 data points for 0 to 2,500 eggs produced, 16 data points for 2,501 to 5,000 eggs produced, 8 data points for 7,501 to 10,000 eggs produced, and 4 data points for 10,001 to 12,500 eggs produced. There are an additional 25 data points for 251 to 1,250 females in the population, nearly all of which are under 2,500 eggs produced.\" class=\"lrn-image-center\" height=\"312\" src=\"/images/02511cf78fe36a89186a4af1c7b760a2.jpg\" width=\"400\"></p>\n\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><i><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"></span></i></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:16px\">Based on the data in Figure 1, which of the following statements best explains the relationship between numbers of females and eggs produced per day per female?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"></span></span></span></span></p>\n",
