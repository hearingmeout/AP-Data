    "prompt": "<p style=\"margin-bottom:16px; margin-left:10px\">A researcher is studying three transport proteins (A, B, and C) in the membrane and has observed that protein A exhibits passive transport. Figure 1 shows the movement of solute particles in the different transport proteins. In the figure, two different conformations of the same protein are shown for protein B and protein C.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Figure 1. Transport proteins A, B, and C in the membrane</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Figure 1. Diagram of transport proteins A, B, and C in the membrane. Each protein is in the phospholipid bilayer. Protein A: Solute particles move from outside the cell to inside the cell. Protein B is shown both closed and open. When closed, no solute particles move through protein B. When open, solute particles move from inside the cell through protein B to outside the cell, where they disperse. Protein C is shown both closed and open. When closed, no solute particles move through protein C. When open, solute particles move from inside the cell through protein C to outside the cell, where they disperse. \" class=\"lrn-image-center\" height=\"203\" src=\"/images/5b1da9327bed570a69961bcbb91bcb64.jpg\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:16px; margin-left:10px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:16px; margin-left:10px\">Based on Figure 1, which of the following experiments would best confirm that protein A utilizes passive transport, while proteins B and C do not?</p>\n",
