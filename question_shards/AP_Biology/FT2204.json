The horizontal axis is labeled Progress of the Reaction, and the vertical axis is labeled Energy.  There are two graphs that begin at the same point approximately slightly more than halfway up the vertical axis. The beginning of the graphs is labeled Reactants and the end of the graphs is labeled Products.  The topmost graph moves horizontally right and curves steeply up and to the right, cresting towards the top end of the vertical axis, and then curves steeply down and to the right, until slightly above the horizontal axis where it moves horizontally right.The bottommost graph moves horizontally right and curves gradually up and to the right at the same point the topmost line curves steeply up and to the right. The graph crests below the crest of the topmost curve and then moves steeply down and to the right, meeting the curve of the topmost graph, until slightly above the horizontal axis where they move horizontally right.There are 4 horizontal dashed lines touching the graphs. From bottom to top, the fist dashed line begins approximately one-third of the way along the horizontal and meets the graphs slightly above the horizontal axis. The second dashed line begins at the same point the two graphs begin on the vertical axis and moves horizontal right, intersecting the point where the graphs meet after their crests, and ends at the right end of the horizontal axis.  The third dashed line begins on the vertical axis at a point parallel to the crest of the bottommost graph, intersecting the topmost graph before and after its crest, and ends approximately three-fourths of the way along the horizontal axis.  The fourth dashed line begins on the vertical axis at a point parallel to the crest of the topmost graph, and ends at the right end of the horizontal axis.\" height=\"213\" src=\"/images/209cf7d6871484a507be5c9cc42f4763.png\" width=\"296\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following questions can best be answered by the diagram?</p>\n",
