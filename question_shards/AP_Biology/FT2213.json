In the late 1950s the first DDT-resistant mosquitoes were discovered, and eventually DDT-resistant mosquitoes were found globally. When DDT is used now, the development of DDT resistance in mosquito populations occurs in months rather than years.</p><p>Which of the following best explains the observations concerning DDT resistance in mosquitoes?</p>",
