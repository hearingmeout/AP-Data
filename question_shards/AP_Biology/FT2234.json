Starting with the Hypothalamus, an arrow with G n R H next to it moves downward ending at Anterior Pituitary. Two arrows branch down from Anterior Pituitary. The arrow on the left side has L H plus written next to it and ends at Leydig Cells. The arrow on the right side has F S H plus next to it and ends at Sertoli Cells. There is an arrow with a plus above it from Leydig Cells to Sertoli Cells. There is an arrow with a plus moving down from Sertoli Cells and ending in Germ Cell. There is a final arrow moving from Germ Cellto Sperm Production. Leydig Cells, Sertoli Cells and Germ Cell are all contained within a shaded oval labeled Testes.On the left side, a line labeled Testosterone connects the Leydig Cells to the Anterior Pituitary and Hypothalamus.

Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are synthetic variants of testosterone that are sometimes abused by persons who desire to enhance their athletic performance or alter their physique. Assuming that AAS function in the same way as naturally occurring testosterone, it is most likely that long-term abuse of AAS would</p>",
