The horizontal axis is labeled Glucose, open parenthesis the fraction mmol over L close parenthesis, the numbers appearing on it, from left to right, are from zero to 27 in increments of 3. The left side of the vertical axis is labeled Glucagon Secretion, the fraction n g over 20 minutes, and the tick marks appearing on it are labeled, from bottom to top, as zero, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. The right side of the vertical axis is labeled Insulin Secretion, the fraction n g over 20 minutes and the tick marks appearing on it are parallel to the tick marks on the left vertical axis and are labeled, from bottom to top, as zero, 800, 1,600, 2,400, 3,200, and 4,000.  Below the graph is a key indicating the solid dots represent Glucagon Secretion and the hollow dots represent Insulin Secretion. All of the dots have vertical lines through their centers representing error bars.   From left to right, the line representing Glucagon secretion starts at a data point with approximate coordinates of zero comma 20 drops sharply down to a data point with approximate coordinates of 16 comma one, and then extends horizontally to a data point with approximate coordinates of 28 comma one. From left to right, the line representing Insulin secretion starts at a data point with approximate coordinates of zero comma zero and curves upward, ending at a data point with approximate coordinates of 28 comma 3,800\" height=\"224\" src=\"/images/8ba40401135bab1cddfb381d51045f59.png\" width=\"285\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows changes in glucagon and insulin secretions at different concentrations of blood glucose.
