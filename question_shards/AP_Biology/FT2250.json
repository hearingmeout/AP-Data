A dialysis bag labeled as starch plus glucose is tied to a dowel that is sitting across the top of the beaker, allowing the bag to be suspended in the water. There is an arrow to a second figure of a beaker with water. In this figure the dialysis bag is bloated and labeled starch plus glucose, and the water is labeled water plus glucose. \" maxwidth=\"800\" src=\"/images/b9b9263958698455d89c4f10869b78cd.png\" width=\"800\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The investigation is aimed at understanding how molecular size affects movement through a membrane.</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following best represents the amount of starch, water, and glucose in the dialysis bag over the course of the investigation?</p>",
