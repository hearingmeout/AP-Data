This type of solution is often used intravenously to quickly rehydrate patients. A drop of the blood from the test tube was placed on a slide and red blood cells (RBCs) were observed under a microscope. Three possible outcomes are diagrammed below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"There are three microscope views of red blood cells. View one shows shrunken red blood cells. There are a dozen red blood cells with jagged edges, they are thin and irregular.View two shows a dozen normal red blood cells. The red blood cells are circular and oval with no irregularities.
