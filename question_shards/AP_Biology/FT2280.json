Some strains of <em>E. coli</em>, a prokaryote, can synthesize the amino acid tryptophan, while other <em>E. coli </em>strains cannot. Similarly, some strains of the yeast <em>S. cerevisiae</em>, a eukaryote, can synthesize tryptophan, while other <em>S. cerevisiae </em>strains cannot.</p><p>Which of the following describes the most likely source of genetic variation found in the tryptophan synthesis pathways of both species?</p>",
