    "prompt": "<p>MRSA is the acronym for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Many of the strains of the common bacterium are also resistant to other antibiotics in use today. The resistance is linked to a collection of genes carried on plasmids that are passed from one bacterium to another by conjugation. Suppose a newly discovered, chemically different antibiotic is used in place of methicillin. Which of the following would be the most likely effect on <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>antibiotic resistance?</p>",
