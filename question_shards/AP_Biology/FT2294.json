There are three bars representing gray, brown and black mice. The gray and black mice have very low bars at low frequency, and the brown mice have a tall bar with high frequency. The second graph is titled fur color distribution after twenty years, with y-axis labeled frequency.

Immediately after the release, a representative sample of the mice was captured, and the fur color of each individual in the sample was observed and recorded. The mice were then returned to the field. After twenty years, another representative sample of the mice was captured, and the fur color of each individual in the sample was again recorded. Which of the following best explains the change in the frequency distribution of fur color phenotypes in the mouse population, as shown in the figures above?</p>\n",
