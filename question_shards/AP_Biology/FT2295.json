Below the hydrated mucus is extracellular fluid with three chloride ions. There is a chloride ion entering the CFTR protein and then travelling through the hydrated mucus in the direction of the extracellular fluid. The second figure is labeled cystic fibrosis and shows a phospholipid bilayer with a mutant CFTR protein from the cytosol to a dehydrated mucus, which is depicted as both darker and thinner than the hydrated mucus. There are three chloride ions in the cytosol, and none in the extracellular fluid below the dehydrated mucus.There is no movement of chloride ions through the CFTR protein. \" height=\"235\" src=\"/images/dd15a46e82648bd1d63131d7a0975069.png\" width=\"565\"></p>\n\n<p>Cystic fibrosis is a recessively inherited disorder that results from a mutation in the gene encoding CFTR chloride ion channels located on the surface of many epithelial cells. As shown in the figure, the mutation prevents the normal movement of chloride ions from the cytosol of the cell to the extracellular fluid. As a consequence of the mutation, the mucus layer that is normally present on the surface of the cells becomes exceptionally dehydrated and viscous.</p>\n\n<p>An answer to which of the following questions would provide the most information about the association between the CFTR mutation and the viscous mucus?</p>\n",
