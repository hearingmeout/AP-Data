It is predicted that if those regulatory sequences are functioning properly, the bacteria will produce the enzymes involved in arabinose metabolism (structural genes <em>B</em>, <em>A,</em> and <em>D</em>) in the presence of arabinose.</p>\n\n<p>If a gene that encodes a green fluorescent protein (GFP) is substituted for the structural genes of the operon, activation of the regulatory sequences can be assayed by GFP expression. A culture of <em>E. coli</em> cells underwent a transformation procedure with a plasmid containing the regulatory sequences of the <em>ara</em> operon directly upstream of the gene encoding the GFP. The plasmid also confers ampicillin resistance to bacteria. Samples were then plated on different types of culture media. (Note: The GFP fluoresces only under UV light, not under white light.) The table below shows the results.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 3 columns, where the first column subdivides in 3 columns, and 5 rows.

The top row contains the column labels: column one, Type of Culture Media; column two, Color of Colonies Under White Light; column three, Color of Colonies Under U V Light. The 3 sub-columns under the first column Type of Culture Media are: sub-column one, Agar; sub-column two, Ampicillin; sub-column three, Arabinose.
