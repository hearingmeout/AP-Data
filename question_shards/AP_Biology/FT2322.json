The hypothalamus has a solid arrow towards the thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or TRH, which has a solid arrow to the anterior pituitary, which has a solid arrow to the thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH, which has a solid arrow to the thyroid gland, which has a solid arrow to thyroxine. Thyroxine has two dashed arrows labeled inhibition, one to the anterior pituitary, and one to the hypothalamus. \" height=\"257\" src=\"/images/3103f6db8f2daad16bcff39541cafb44.png\" width=\"295\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above illustrates feedback control as exerted by the hormone thyroxine. Following surgical removal of the thyroid gland, the level of TSH in the blood will increase. Which of the following best explains this increase?</p>\n",
