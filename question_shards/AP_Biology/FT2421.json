A is the beginning of the curve when the slope is zero and there is a low number of individuals, B is next on the curve with a higher number of individuals when the slope is one, C is next on the curve with a higher number of individuals at the point where the curve transitions from a rapidly increasing number of individuals to a slowing rate of growth.
