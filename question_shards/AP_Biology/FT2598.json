The first level of the pedigree, which is the first generation, is a non-shaded circle and non-shaded square with five descendants that are a shaded circle, two non-shaded circles and two non-shaded squares. The shaded circle, which is the second generation, is paired with a shaded square, and there are two descendants in the third generation, a shaded circle and a shaded square. The shaded circle in the third generation is paired with a non-shaded square, with four descendants in the fourth generation, two of which are non-shaded circles and two of which are non-shaded squares. The shaded square of the third generation is paired with a shaded circle and they have four descendants in the fourth generation, three of which are shaded circles and one of which is a shaded square. The next second generation individual with offspring is a non-shaded square paired with a non-shaded circle with three descendants in the third generation, two of which are non-shaded circles and one of which is a shaded square. The shaded square is paired with a non-shaded circle and there are four descendants in the fourth generation, three of which are non-shaded circles and one of which is a non-shaded square. The final second generation individual with offspring is anon-shaded circle paired with a non-shaded square, and there are four descendants in the third generation, two of which are non-shaded circles, one of which is a shaded square and one of which is non-shaded square. The shaded square in the third generation is paired with a shaded circle, and there are three descendants in the fourth generation, all of which are shaded circles. One non-shaded circle in the third generation is paired with a non-shaded square, and there are three descendants in the fourth generation, all of which are non-shaded circles. \" height=\"126\" src=\"/images/fc445c1b631e1f5095416118bad06a7f.png\" width=\"545\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the pedigree above, circles represent females, squares represent males, and shaded figures represent individuals expressing a specific trait.
