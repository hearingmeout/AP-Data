The second set are shaded and joined together by two circles on the strings near the top in an identical fashion. The two sets of strings are lined up with their circles at the same height. There is an arrow to the next phase where the string on the first set that is closer to the second set is broken halfway down the string. The string on the second set that is closest to the first set is broken at the same position. There is an arrow pointing to the next phase where there are lines connecting the bottom broken strand of one string to the top of the broken strand on the opposite set and vice versa, creating an X between the broken pieces of string and connecting them to the string on the other set. There is an arrow pointing to a final phase where both sets of strings are once again intact. The string that was broken on the unshaded pair is now shaded after the point where it was broken before and the string that was broken on the shaded pair is unshaded after the point where it was broken before.\" height=\"104\" src=\"/images/0421f7afcc684d2490ee94112fa48758.png\" width=\"348\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above illustrates which of the following processes?</p>\n",
