(The formula for the surface area of a cube is 6 X <em>S</em><sup>2</sup>, and the formula for the volume of a cube is <em>S</em><sup>3</sup>, where <em>S</em> = the length of a side of the cube.)</p><p></p><p>Which of the following cube-shaped cells would be most efficient in removing waste by diffusion?</p>",
