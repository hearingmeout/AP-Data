Native to the Indian Ocean, <em>C. taxifolia </em>is known for aggressive growth and an ability to compete with sea grasses.It is currently on an international list of invasive species. Which of the following best predicts the consequences of the introduction of<em> C. taxifolia </em>to the California coast?</p>",
