There are evenly spaced tick marks along the horizontal axis, labeled with the years from 1955 through 1995, in increments of 5 years. There are evenly spaced tick marks along the left vertical axis, labeled from 0 through 60,in increments of 10. There are evenly spaced tick marks along the right vertical axis, labeled from zero through 2500,in increments of 250. There are two lines on the graph: a solid line representing wolves and a dashed line representing moose.The wolf line is as follows, from left to right: it starts at the left side of the graph at about 20 in 1958, moves up and then down slightly to 20 in 1963, moves up to about 28 in 1965, moves down to about 16 in 1969, moves up to about 22 in 1972, continues up to about 45 in 1977, moves down to about 35 in 1978, moves up to about 48 in 1980, moves down to about 12 in 1982, moves up to about 25 in 1984, moves down to about 11 in 1988, then moves up and down slightly until it ends at about 16 in 1995. The mooseline is as follows, from left to right: it starts at the left side of the graph at about 500 in 1958, moves gradually up to about 1,250 in 1969, continues to move up to about 1,400 in 1972, then moves gradually down to about 1,000 in 1977, continues to move down to about 900 in 1982, then moves gradually down and then up to about 1,000 in 1987, continues to move up to about 1,700 in 1988, then moves down to about 1,250 in 1990, then moves up to about 1,900 in 1993,and up again until it ends at about 2,400 in 1995.\" height=\"230\" src=\"/images/cda1c15f6eaf60cdbedeee119c741336.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above represents the number of individuals in a population of wolves and in a population of moose observed in the same isolated geographic area over a 40-year period, from 1955 through 1995.
