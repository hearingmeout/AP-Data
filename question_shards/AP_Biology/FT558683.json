Each figure shows the distance of the hive to a flower patch, the angle made between the flower patch, the hive, and the Sun, and a diagram of a waggle dance. The hive on the left is 500 meters from its flower patch.  The angle made between the flower patch, the hive, and the Sun is 30 degrees. The waggle dance is angled to the top left and hasa waggle phase of 375 milliseconds.  The hive on the right is 160 meters from its flower patch.
