The labeled bacteriophages were incubated with bacteria for a brief amount of time and then removed. The infected bacteria cells were found to contain significant amounts of radioactive phosphorus but not radioactive sulfur. </p><p>Based on the results of the experiment, which of the following types of molecules did the bacteriophages most likely inject into the bacteria cells? </p>",
