The vertical axis is labeled “Proportion of Hatchlings That Are Male,” and the numbers 0 through 1, in increments of 0 point 5, are indicated. The three curves are labeled “Green Turtles”, “Crocodilians”, and “Lizards”.   The curve labeled “Green Turtles” begins at 20 degrees Celsius and 1 male hatchling. It moves slightly downward and to the right at first until it reaches approximately 27 degrees Celsius and 0 point 9 5 male hatchling. It then descends steeply until it reaches approximately 33 degrees and 0 point 0 5 male hatchling. At this point it moves slightly downward and to the right until it ends at approximately 40 degrees Celsius and 0 male hatchlings.   The curve labeled “Lizards” begins at 20 degrees Celsius and 0 male hatchlings. It moves slightly upward and to the right at first until it reaches approximately 27 degrees Celsius and 0 point 0 5 male hatchling. It then rises steeply until it reaches approximately 33 degrees and 0 point 9 5 male hatchling. At this point it moves slightly upward and to the right until it ends at approximately 40 degrees Celsius and 1 male hatchling.  The curve labeled “Crocodilians” begins at 20 degrees Celsius and 0 male hatchling. It moves horizontally to the right at first until it reaches approximately 23 degrees Celsius and 0 point 0 male hatchlings. It then curves steeply upward and to the right until it reaches approximately 30 degrees and 1 male hatchling. At his point it curves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches approximately 37 degrees Celsius and 1 male hatchling. It continues horizontally until it ends.  The Green Turtles curve intersects the Lizards curve at 30 degrees Celsius and 0 point 5 male hatchling. The Crocodilians curve intersects the Green Turtles curve at approximately 27 degrees and 0 point 9 male hatchling, and it intersects the Lizards curve at approximately 37 degrees and 0 point 9 male hatchling.\" height=\"248\" src=\"/images/a92cc53eaf5fbfba267fd6e073dd0f72.png\" width=\"230\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The graph above represents the proportions of hatchlings of certain types of reptiles that are male at different egg incubation temperatures.
