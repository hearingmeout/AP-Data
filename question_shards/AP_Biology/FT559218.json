Prior to the 1960s, all members of a particular blackcap population flew to Spain, which had an abundant natural food source. Now, some members of the same blackcap population fly to the United Kingdom, where food placed in feeders by humans is abundant. The blackcaps return to the same forests in Germany to nest during the breeding season.</p>\n\n<p>Some blackcaps that migrate to the United Kingdom have become distinguishable by certain physical and behavioral traits from blackcaps that migrate to Spain. Which of the following best predicts the effect on the blackcap population if humans in the United Kingdom continue to place food in feeders during the winter?</p>\n",
