For each ion or molecule, the relative concentration on each side of the membrane is indicated. From left to right, the diagram is labeled as follows.  The molecule is labeled “High O subscript 2” on top, and “Low O subscript 2” on bottom. An arrow is shown starting from the top and going downward through the plasma membrane. The ion is labeled “High N a superscript plus” on top, and “Low N a superscript plus” on bottom. An arrow is shown starting from the top and going downward through a channel protein. The molecule is labeled “High Glucose” on top, and “Low Glucose” on bottom. An arrow is shown starting from the top and going downward through a channel protein. The ion is labeled “High N a superscript plus” on top, and “Low N a superscript plus” on bottom. An arrow is shown starting from the bottom and going upward through a channel protein.
