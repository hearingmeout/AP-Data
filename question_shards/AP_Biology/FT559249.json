    "prompt": "<p style=\"margin-left: 280px;\"><img alt=\"The figure presents two processes. The first process is fertilization. A sperm fusing with an egg is shown. The second process is transduction. A five step process is shown. Step 1. Virus attaches to cell surface and inserts viral DNA into cell. Step 2. The cell’s circular DNA is broken into many pieces. Step 3. new viral particles are formed in the cell that include DNA from the host cell. Step 4. One of the new viral particles infects another cell. Step 5. The DNA from the virus is inserted into the circular chromosome of the shot cell.  \" height=\"362\" src=\"/images/fffc61247f40e2da80dfa3859b437054.png\" width=\"195\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following correctly compares the two processes shown above?</p>\n",
