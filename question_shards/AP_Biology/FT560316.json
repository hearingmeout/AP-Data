The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the vertical axis is labeled Resistant Isolates, by percent. Eight tick marks appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled, from left to right, one through 8, in increments of one. Five tick marks appear on the vertical axis and are labeled, from bottom to top, zero through 20, in increments of 5. On the graph, there are 8 data points connected by a curve drawn through the points. The first and last data points are the start and end of the curve, and the approximate coordinates of the data points are as follows: Point One: one comma 2. Point 2: two comma 2 point five. Point 3: three comma 2 Point 4: four comma 3. Point 5: five comma 4. Point 6: six comma 7. Point 7: seven comma 14.
