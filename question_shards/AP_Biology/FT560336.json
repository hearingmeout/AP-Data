An S shaped curve on the graph begins at the origin, moves briefly to the right along the horizontal axis, then curves up and to the right, continues steeply upward in almost a straight line, and then begins to level off near the top of the graph by curving to the right and running parallel to the horizontal axis. Four sections of the S curve are labeled. Starting at the bottom of the S curve, the first upward curve is labeled IV. The center of the steep upward section of the curve is labeled III, the top curve, where it begins to move horizontally to the right, is labeled II, and the end of the S curve, in the upper right region of the graph, is labeled I.\" height=\"168\" src=\"/images/cb951ae30a8d67ad87031b9639248704.png\" width=\"175\"></p>\n\n<p>One model of a sustainable fisheries practice is for individual fish to be removed from a natural population at a rate equal to the highest possible growth rate of an ideal population. The graph above represents a population of bluefin tuna living along the Atlantic coast. At which labeled point in the graph is the population growth rate the highest?</p>\n",
