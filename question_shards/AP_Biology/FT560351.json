The cell body of the bacterium is represented by an elongated oval shape, like a pill capsule. Attached to one end of the cell body is a long, tail-like structure. Covering the outer surface of the cell body are small, spike-like structures. The cell body is shown as being enclosed by three layers, a thick outer layer, a thin middle layer, and a thin inner layer. In some places, the inner layer is shown projecting through the middle and outer layers to reach the exterior of the cell body. The interior of the cell body is a single chamber that contains a large, ribbon-like structure twisted around itself, a much smaller circular, ribbon-like structure, and many dot-like structures scattered throughout the chamber. \" height=\"167\" src=\"/images/f6fb3872675eaf7537d8c6faac9f13e4.png\" width=\"240\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above represents a typical rod-shaped bacterium.
