The control of breathing, for example, involves neural pathways among the structures represented in the figure above. One important stimulus in the control of breathing is an increase in blood CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, which is detected as a decrease in blood pH.<img alt=\"The figure shows the flow of neural signals between structures. The leftmost structure is an illustration of a human torso and is labeled Lungs, Rib Cage, and Diaphragm. The rightmost structure is an illustration of a human heart and is labeled Heart. The center structure, above the previous structures, is an illustration of a human brain and is labeled Brain. Solid and dashed arrows show the movement of neural signals. Solid arrows show the flow of Neural signals to the brain from the Lungs, Rib Cage, and Diaphragm, and from the Heart. Dashed arrows show the flow of Neural signals from the brain to the Lungs, Rib Cage, and Diaphragm, and to the Heart.\" height=\"452\" src=\"/images/d36b4db1c6e80d2b12f4bbcc5264626b.png\" width=\"455\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following best explains the physiological response to an overall increase in cellular respiration in the body?</p>\n",
