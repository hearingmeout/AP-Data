The cladogram below was created based on the information in the table to represent groups of related species. The presence of the derived characters is indicated with arrows.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 240px;\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a cladogram with the root of the main line at the bottom left and three equally spaced branches coming off the main line. From left to right, the branches are labeled as follows: “Species Group 1,” “Species Group 2,” and “Species Group 3.” Past the third branch, the upper right end of the main line is labeled “Species Group 4.” Three arrows are drawn pointing to the main line of the cladogram. The first arrow points to the main line midway between branch 1 and branch 2. The second arrow points to the main line midway between branch 2 and branch 3. The third arrow points to the main line midway between branch 3 and the end of the main line that is labeled 4.\" height=\"106\" src=\"/images/d3510b04d2f220758ea9084454683736.jpg\" width=\"400\"></p>\n\n<p>Group IV of the cladogram most likely includes which of the following species?</p>\n",
