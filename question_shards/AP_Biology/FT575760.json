    "prompt": "<p>Eye color in a particular strain of fly is influenced by one gene with two alleles: a dominant allele that results in red eyes and a recessive allele that results in sepia eyes.</p>\n\n<p>A red-eyed female from a true-breeding population is mated with a sepia-eyed male. The F1 offspring are all red-eyed. The F1 flies are allowed to interbreed, producing the following in the F2 generation.</p>\n\n<p>Females: 40 red eyes; 13 sepia eyes</p>\n\n<p>Males: 39 red eyes; 11 sepia eyes</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following best describes the likely mode of inheritance for the eye-color gene?</p>\n",
