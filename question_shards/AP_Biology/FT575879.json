The following description starts at the top of the figure with S phase. As S phase ends, G 1 cyclin is degraded, leaving a c d k that is free and not complexed with any other molecule. G 2 phase follows, and a mitotic cyclin binds with the c d k. The two molecules form an activated mitotic cyclin c d k complex. Mitosis follows, and the mitotic cyclin is degraded, leaving the c d k free. G 1 phase follows, and a G 1 cyclin binds with the c d k. The two molecules form an activated G 1 cyclin c d k complex.
