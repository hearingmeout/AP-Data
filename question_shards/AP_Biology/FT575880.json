    "prompt": "<p>26. The <em>lac </em>operon in <em>E. coli </em>consists of genes that code for enzymes necessary for the breakdown of lactose. When lactose is absent, the operon is inactive because a repressor protein binds to a specific site in the <em>lac </em>operon. When lactose is present, lactose molecules bind to the repressor protein, causing the repressor protein to dissociate from the binding site. In the absence of glucose (a preferred energy source for bacteria), the protein CAP binds to a regulatory site near the <em>lac </em>promoter to activate transcription of the <em>lac </em>operon.</p>\n\n<p>The following symbols represent the macromolecules involved in regulation of the <em>lac </em>operon.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a key for the following answer choices. The key indicates that an unshaded circle represents “Repressor,” two shaded hexagons connected by a line represent “Lactose,” an unshaded triangle represents “C A P,” an unshaded oval represents “R N A, polymerase,” and a squiggly line indicates “m R N A.”\" height=\"47\" src=\"/images/85c79341972e7e0140bb24524f01321a.jpg\" width=\"800\"></p>\n\n<p>In the diagrams below, the horizontal line represents the <em>lac </em>operon and the bent arrow represents the transcription start site of the <em>lac </em>operon. Which of the following diagrams best represents the scenario in which lactose is available to the cell and glucose is absent?</p>\n",
