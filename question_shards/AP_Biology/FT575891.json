There are two horizontal axes, one above the graph and one below the graph. The horizontal axis below the graph is labeled “Days,” and the numbers 5 through 30, in increments of 5, are indicated. The horizontal axis above the graph is labeled “Moon Phase,” and the following four moon phases are labeled: “Full Moon,” “First Quarter,” “New Moon,” and “Third Quarter.” The positions of the moon phases are aligned at the following days: Full Moon, 5 days; First Quarter, 12 days; New Moon, 18 days; Third Quarter, 25 days. The vertical axis of the graph is labeled “Nighttime high tides through one lunar period, in feet,” and the numbers 3 through 7, in increments of 1, are indicated. The curve resembles a sinusoidal curve, and begins at the point 0 days with a height of 4.8 feet. The curve increases to a local maximum of 6.3 feet at the Full Moon, at the point 5 days. The curve then decreases to a local minimum of 4.1 feet at the First Quarter, at the point 12 days. The curve then increases to a maximum of 6.9 feet at the New Moon, at the point 18 days. The curve then decreases to a minimum of 3.9 feet after the Third Quarter, at the point 27 days. The curve then increases to 4.8 feet at its end point of 30 days.\" height=\"190\" src=\"/images/fe5d9a1612409f092f1236c7dfd80adf.jpg\" width=\"650\"></p>\n\n<p>The California grunion (<em>Leuresthes tenuis</em>) is a small marine fish that lives in shallow waters near the ocean shore.
