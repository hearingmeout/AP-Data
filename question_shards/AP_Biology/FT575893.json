The model is composed of two cycles, arranged vertically, that share a common element at the center of the model. The common element is labeled “Normal Blood Calcium Levels.” The cycles are described as follows.  The information in the first cycle is presented as follows. Beginning at the common element, “Normal Blood Calcium Levels,” an arrow labeled “Blood Calcium Levels Rise” points from this phrase toward the phrase “Thyroid Releases Calcitonin.” From this phrase, an arrow points toward a box containing the phrases “Calcium Deposited in Bones” and “Increased Calcium Excretion.” From the box, an arrow labeled “Blood Calcium Levels Fall” points toward the beginning of the cycle at the common element, “Normal Blood Calcium Levels.”  The information in the second cycle is presented as follows. Beginning at the common element, “Normal Blood Calcium Levels,” an arrow labeled “Blood Calcium Levels Fall” points from this phrase toward the phrase “Parathyroid Releases Parathyroid Hormone (P T H).” From this phrase, an arrow points toward a box containing the phrases “Calcium Released from Bones” and “Decreased Calcium Excretion.” From the box, an arrow labeled “Blood Calcium Levels Rise” points toward the beginning of the cycle at the common element, “Normal Blood Calcium Levels.”\" height=\"532\" src=\"/images/eb0f0042dee08f4be2a945c68ecfc056.jpg\" width=\"500\"></p>\n\n<p>The model shown in the figure represents the role of two hormones, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH), in maintaining normal blood calcium levels in humans. If a dietary change results in an increase in blood calcium concentration above normal levels, which of the following is the most likely effect on calcium homeostasis?</p>\n",
