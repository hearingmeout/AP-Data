The vertical axis is labeled Rate of Entry of Substance, in micromoles per minute, and the numbers 10, 100, and 1,000 are indicated at equal intervals. The first curve, labeled Acetate, is a straight line that begins at the point 0.1 milimolar, 1.5 micromoles per minute, and moves upward and to the right, passing through the point 1.0 milimolar, 10.4 micromoles per minute. The curve then passes through the point 10.0 milimolars, 107 micromoles per minute, and ends at the point 100.0 milimolars, 1,020 micromoles per minute. The second curve, labeled Ethyl Alcohol, begins at the point 0.1 millimolar, 7 micromoles per minute, and moves gradually upward and to the right, passing through the point 1.0 millimolar, 20 micromoles per minute. It then passes through the point 10.0 millimolar, 35 micromoles per minute, and ends at the point 100.0 milimolar, 50 micromoles per minute.\" height=\"386\" src=\"/images/4885e1c99b5a19932315c14e53b71fa3.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">What additional procedure would best help determine whether these movements are due to active transport or to passive transport?</p>\n",
