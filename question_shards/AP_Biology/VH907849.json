Cholesterol molecules are often delivered to body cells by the blood, which transports the molecules in the form of cholesterol-protein complexes. The complexes must be moved into the body cells before the cholesterol molecules can be incorporated into the phospholipid bilayers of cell membranes.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the information presented, which of the following is the most likely explanation for a buildup of cholesterol molecules in the blood of an animal?</p>\n",
