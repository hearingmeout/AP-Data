The researchers dissolved the enzyme in an aqueous buffer solution and added urea to the solution. The enzyme did not appear to have a secondary or tertiary structure. The researchers carefully removed the urea from the solution and determined that the enzyme had the original secondary and tertiary structure again.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the results of the experiment, which of the following statements best predicts the effect of urea on the enzyme’s function?</p>\n",
