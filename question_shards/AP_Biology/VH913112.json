There is a partial negative charge near the oxygen atom and partial positive charges near the hydrogen atoms due to the uneven distribution of electrons between the atoms, which results in the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The polarity of water molecules contributes to many properties of water that are important for biological processes.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following models best demonstrates the arrangement of hydrogen bonds between adjacent water molecules?</p>\n",
