Two hormones, insulin and glucagon, are directly involved in regulating the blood glucose level to maintain a healthy level. Insulin acts to lower the blood&nbsp;glucose level, and glucagon acts to increase the blood glucose level.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a line graph of blood glucose fluctuations of an individual. The horizontal axis is labeled Time, and the times 6 A M through 2 P M are indicated, in increments of 2 hours. The vertical axis is labeled Blood Glucose Levels, in milligrams per deciliter, and the numbers 60 through 140, in increments of 20, are indicated. The graph indicates that meals occurred at 6 A M and 11 A M. The data represented by the line are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line begins at 6 A M and 80 milligrams per deciliter, and steeply moves upward and to the right until it reaches 7 A M and 130 milligrams per deciliter. It then moves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches 8 A M and 80 milligrams per deciliter. The line moves gradually downward and to the right until it reaches 11 A M and 70 milligrams per deciliter. The line then moves upward and to the right until it reaches 12:30 P M and 130 milligrams per deciliter. The line steeply moves downward and to the right until it ends at 2 P M and 75 milligrams per deciliter.\" height=\"408\" src=\"/images/3dce2045ff0e04847aa3c9bdb12a2545.png\" width=\"500\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"standalone_statement style:1\">Figure 1.
