The substance is the substrate of a certain enzyme. The researcher adds a small amount of the enzyme to the reaction mixture and measures the amount of product that is formed over time. The data are represented in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents the graph of a curve in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled Time, and no numbers are indicated along it. The vertical axis is labeled Amount of Product, and no numbers are indicated along it. Both axes end with arrowheads. The curve begins at the intersection of the 2 axes, then moves upwards and to the right at about a 45 degree angle. The curve then levels off, becoming approximately horizontal as it moves to the right. A point indicated about two thirds of the way along the horizontal region of the curve is labeled Add More Substrate.\" height=\"314\" src=\"/images/99c3630a6852861179b93b70e28bfc08.png\" width=\"400\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
