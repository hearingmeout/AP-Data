Anaphase 1 consists of one circle representing a cell in which there are four chromosomes, each shown as a pair of chromatids. Two of the chromosomes are large and similar in shape, and two of the chromosomes are small and similar in shape. In Anaphase 2 the one circle has split into two circles, representing two cells. One of the circles contains four individual chromosomes, two large and two small. The other circle contains two individual small chromosomes and one large chromosome that is still composed of a pair of chromatids and is labeled nondisjunction.\" height=\"401\" src=\"/images/fe34da81f2a634abee90d6b0c426b523.png\" width=\"400\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
