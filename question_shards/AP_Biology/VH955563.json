Tadpole mouthparts can vary significantly, prompting researchers to categorize them as either omnivore-morph or carnivore-morph. Carnivore-morph tadpoles are larger and have mouthparts that are better suited for predation. Remarkably, carnivore-morph tadpoles can change into omnivore-morph tadpoles when the food supply changes.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best describes an advantage of the phenotypic plasticity displayed by the tadpoles?</p>\n",
