    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">In mitosis, the chromosomes consist of a single chromatid, which is passed to two haploid daughter cells. In meiosis, the chromosomes consist of two chromatids during the first round of division and one chromatid during the second round of division, resulting in two haploid daughter cells.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">In mitosis, synapsis of homologous chromosomes results in four haploid daughter cells after one division. In meiosis, synapsis of homologous chromosomes occurs during the second division and results in four diploid daughter cells.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Mitosis produces one identical daughter cell after one round of division. Meiosis has two rounds of division and doubles the number of chromosomes in the second round of division, producing four diploid cells.</p>",
