A group of scientists hypothesize that this difference means the cell wall has largely different functions in plant cells and fungal cells. Alternatively, another group of scientists hypothesize that despite their biochemical differences, plant and fungal cell walls serve similar functions.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following observations would best support the alternative hypothesis described above?</p>\n",
