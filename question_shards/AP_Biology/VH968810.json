Since the mid-1800s, a population of flies has emerged that instead feed on domesticated apples. Apple maggot flies typically mate on or near the fruit of their host plants. Many varieties of apples ripen three to four weeks before the hawthorn fruits do.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The different fruit preferences of the two fly populations will most likely have which of the following effects?</p>\n",
