The Spliceosome is represented by a circle. A line begins to the left of the circle and that section of line is labeled Exon 1. The line moves into the circle, dips down below the circle, then curves back up into the circle, leaves the circle from the right side and at that point that section of line outside the circle is labeled Exon 2. An arrow points upward and to the right from the right end of the line to Spliced Exons that represent the combined 2 ends of the lines outside of the circle labeled Exon 1 and Exon 2. Moving back to the circle, an arrow points downward and to the right from the circle to the Removed Intron and that line represents the rest of the line that had started inside the circle and then dipped down below the circle and then curved back up into the circle.\" height=\"272\" src=\"/images/cd8f6d4555a7dc70f4d76b0fed43473b.png\" width=\"500\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
