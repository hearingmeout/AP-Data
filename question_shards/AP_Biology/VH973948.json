Ancestral pocket mice all had light-colored coats that blended in with the region’s rocks and sandy soil, keeping the mice hidden from predatory owls. About 1.7 million years ago, a series of volcanic eruptions spewed out wide trails of black lava into the middle of rock pocket mouse territory. Currently there are two color morphs of rock pocket mice: light-colored mice that are typically found in habitats with sandy soil, and dark-colored mice that are typically found in habitats with dark-colored lava rocks.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best justifies the claim that alleles that may be adaptive in one type of environment can be deleterious in another because of different selective pressures?</p>\n",
