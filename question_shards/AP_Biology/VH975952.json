After 20 generations of allowing this population of about 1000 flies to mate randomly, 10 females and 10 males were isolated from the rest of the population. Both the larger population and the isolated population were maintained under identical conditions and allowed to mate randomly for another 20 generations. After the 20 generations, DNA sequencing was used to determine the genetic composition of each population.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following predicts the expected outcome of the experiment?</p>\n",
