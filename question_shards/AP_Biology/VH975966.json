To test their claim, they monitored 12 populations of <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">E. coli</span> for 10,000 generations under the same environmental conditions. They found that although all 12 populations were exposed to the same environmental pressures, each population had differentiated from one another genetically after 10,000 generations.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements includes a reasonable refinement that researchers could use in repeating the experiment?</p>\n",
