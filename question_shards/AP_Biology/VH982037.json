      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The alternate hypothesis is supported because invasive Burmese pythons caused an increase in the mosquito population. This enabled them to transmit the Everglades virus at a higher frequency if they were infected.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The alternate hypothesis is supported because the invasive Burmese pythons caused mosquitoes to switch to feeding on cotton rats. This means that mosquitoes are more likely to carry the Everglades virus when they bite humans.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The alternate hypothesis is refuted because humans are used as hosts for only a small percentage of mosquito feedings. Humans therefore will not have an increase in Everglades virus infection.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The alternate hypothesis is refuted by the data because the population of cotton rats increased. Since there are more cotton rats, they will contain the Everglades virus and prevent it from infecting humans.</p>",
