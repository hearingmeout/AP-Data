The scientists calculated the average beak depth of finches in mating pairs and then observed whether or not the pairs produced at least one offspring that survived to the next season. The data are represented in Figure 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 4 bars. The horizontal axis is labeled Average Beak Depth of Parents, in millimeters, and the numbers 3 through 6, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Percent of Pairs Successfully Producing at Least One Offspring, and the numbers 0 through 30, in increments of 10, are indicated. The following data is represented by the graph. Note that all values are approximate. Average Beak Depth, 3 millimeters. Percent of Pairs Successfully Producing at Least One Offspring, 10 percent. Average Beak Depth, 4 millimeters. Percent of Pairs Successfully Producing at Least One Offspring, 20 percent. Average Beak Depth, 5 millimeters.
