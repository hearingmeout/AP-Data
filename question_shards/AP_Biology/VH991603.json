A population of a species of mouse that typically lives in habitats with light-colored soil was studied for several generations. The background color of the habitat of this population became darker after the second generation due to human activity. A researcher sampled approximately 120 mice in each generation and recorded the fur color phenotypes as shown in Figure 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 4 categories. The categories are labeled along the horizontal axis as First Generation through Fourth generation. Each category has two bars indicated on it, which are each labeled Light-colored fur and Dark-colored fur, respectively. Each bar has an error range indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Number of Mice, and the numbers 0 through 120, in increments of 20, are indicated. The data for each bar is presented as follows. Note that all values are approximate. First Generation. Light-colored fur, 100, plus or minus 8. Dark-colored fur, 20, plus or minus 8. Second Generation. Light-colored fur, 91, plus or minus 16. Dark-colored fur, 30, plus or minus 10. Third Generation. Light-colored fur, 60, plus or minus 8. Dark-colored fur, 60, plus or minus 8. Fourth Generation. Light-colored fur, 20, plus or minus 4.
