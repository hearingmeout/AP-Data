These iguanas feed on red and green algae. During an El Niño climate event, surface waters and their currents in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become significantly warmer than usual. Also during El Niño years, land masses experience increased rainfall.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A researcher suggests that El Niño conditions cause a significant decrease in the size of the Galápagos marine iguana population. Which of the following would best support this alternative hypothesis?</p>\n",
