Data for zooplankton. The line begins approximately one third of the way up the vertical axis above the origin and trends slightly upwards and to the right, fluctuating up and down across the length of the horizontal axis with upward spikes approximately every two years, and a significant downward spike at the year 1998 that falls to just above the horizontal axis. Data for phytoplankton. The line begins just below the midpoint on the vertical axis, above the origin, and trends slightly upwards and to the right, fluctuating up and down across the length of the horizontal axis, staying above the line for zooplankton and with a significant downward spike at the year 1998 that falls one third of the way up the vertical axis, comes back up by 1999, and remains fairly constant after that.\" height=\"248\" src=\"/images/afea81e9f84400133774c4c436f49869.png\" width=\"450\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure&nbsp;1.
