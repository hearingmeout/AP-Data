      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wolves help balance the population sizes of other species, allowing more species to thrive in the wolves’ presence than in their absence.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wolves prey on certain species, increasing competition among other species, which results in a decrease in biodiversity in the ecosystem.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wolves are not affected by factors that typically limit the population size; therefore their population can grow exponentially, increasing the demand on the parks’ resources.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wolves prey on other species without having any natural predators themselves; therefore their presence significantly decreases many populations within the community.</p>",
