An increase in blood glucose levels stimulates beta cells to produce insulin, which facilitates the uptake of glucose by body cells and reduces the glucose levels in the blood. As the blood glucose levels decrease, beta cells are no longer stimulated and stop producing insulin.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best explains the feedback mechanism that regulates blood glucose levels?</p>\n",
