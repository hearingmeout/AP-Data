A scientist crossed flies that are heterozygous for both traits and determined the number of offspring with each combination of phenotypes. The scientist performed a chi-square analysis to determine if the data are consistent with the expectations for independent assortment. The chi-square calculated value for the experiment was <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6.03\"><math alttext=\"6.03\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6.03</mn></math></span></span>.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the chi-square calculated value, which of the following statements is most accurate?</p>\n",
