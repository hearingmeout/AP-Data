The bottom nine of these ten branches are Toadfish, Bettas, Cichlids, Anglerfish, Icefish, Perches, Tuna, Scorpion Fish, and Pufferfish. The top branch of these ten branches is further divided into three branches, labeled Sticklebacks, Spiny Eels, and Guppies.\" height=\"278\" src=\"/images/70be2af2b55a6453a10070847e5ed4f7.svg\" width=\"300\">\n<p class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">Figure 1.
