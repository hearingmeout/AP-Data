They have large wings used to soar as they search for dead animals with their vision. New World vultures have similar digestive systems and wingspans; however, they search for food using their sense of smell. Old World vultures and New World vultures are not closely related.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best explains how Old World vultures and New World vultures both evolved to feed mainly on carrion?</p>\n",
