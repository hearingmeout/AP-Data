The reaction begins with two molecules, the atoms of which are represented by letters. One molecule shows a C that has a single bond with H above the C, a single bond with H 2 N to the left of the C, a single bond with C O O H to the right of the C, and a single bond with R 1 below the C. The second molecule is identical to the first one except that it has an R 2 group instead of an R 1 group. These two molecules react to yield two molecules. One molecule, from left to right is as follows: An H 2 N has a single bond to a C. The C has a single bond with an H above and a single bond with R 1 below. The C also has a single bond with a C to the right. The C to the right has a double bond with an O above and a single bond with an N to the right. The N has a single bond with an H above and a single bond with a C to the right. The C to the right has a single bond with an H above, a single bond with C O O H to the right, and a single bond with R 2 below. The second molecule is H 2 O.\" src=\"/images/d99ba7a550c49a24d7fba5fb66aebc33.svg\"><p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
