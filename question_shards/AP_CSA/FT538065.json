    "prompt": "<p>Consider a shuffle method that is intended to return a new array that contains all the elements from nums, but in a different order. Let n be the number of elements in nums. The shuffle method should alternate the elements from nums [0] … nums[n / 2 – 1] with the elements from nums[n / 2] …nums[n – 1], as illustrated in the following examples.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Two examples are shown. Each has two arrays, one labeled nums and the other labeled result. In Example 1, each array has 8 entries in boxes in a horizontal row with the numbers 0 through 7 written above the entries from left to right. The values in the array labeled nums are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80. The last four boxes are shaded grey. The values in the array labeled result are 10, 50, 20, 60, 30, 70, 40, and 80. The second, fourth, sixth, and eighth boxes are shaded grey. \n\nIn Example 2, each array has 7 entries in boxes in a horizontal row with the numbers 0 through 6 written above the entries from left to right. The values in the array labeled nums are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70. The last four boxes are shaded grey. The values in the array labeled result are 10, 40, 20, 50, 30, 60, and 70.
