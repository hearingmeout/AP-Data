The cursor is then repositioned at the end of the line segment that was drawn. Consider the following program, where the cursor starts in the upper left corner of a grid of dots. The dots are spaced one unit apart.</p><p>Draw  (1,  right)</p><p>Draw  (2,  down)</p><p>Draw  (1,  left)</p><p>Draw  (1,  right)</p><p>Draw  (1,  up)</p><p>Draw  (1,  left)</p><p>Which of the following represents the figure that is drawn by the program?</p>",
