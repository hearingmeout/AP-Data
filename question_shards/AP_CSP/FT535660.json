In the first row it reads oval then a picture of an oval in the left column, and The start or end of the algorithm in the right column. In the second row it reads rectangle then a picture of a rectangle in the left column, and One or more processing steps, such as a statement that assigns a value to a variable in the right column. In the third row it reads Diamond then a picture of a diamond in the left column, and A conditional or decision step, where execution proceeds to the side labeled true if the condition is true and to the side labeled false otherwise in the right column. In the fourth row it reads parallelogram and a picture of a parallelogram in the left column, and Displays a message in the right column.\" height=\"238\" src=\"/images/25602fe17e26d0d8732cf2f4a297a71f.png\" width=\"650\"></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A flowchart of an algorithm is shown. At the top is an oval with the word Start in it. An arrow points down from Start to a rectangle in which it reads count left arrow 1. An arrow points down from this rectangle to the top of a diamond in which it reads count less than 5. An arrow points down from the count less than 5 diamond to a rectangle in which it reads count left arrow count plus 1, and the word true is written next to the arrow pointing down to this rectangle. An arrow points down from the bottom of this last rectangle, and the arrow turns to the left then up then right until it meets the left side of the count less than 5 diamond. An arrow points to the right from the right corner of the count less than 5 diamond to a parallelogram in which it reads Display open parentheses count close parentheses, and the word false is written next to the arrow pointing to this parallelogram. Another arrow points down from the bottom of this parallelogram to an oval in which it reads End.\" height=\"451\" src=\"/images/87ee38d332fdda05f0ce038a0a61903e.png\" width=\"465\"></p>\n\n<p>What is displayed as a result of executing the algorithm in the flowchart?</p>\n",
