Which of the following are reasons to use simulation software in this context?</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman\"><li><p>Using simulation software can save the company money by helping to compare designs early in the process, before prototype cars are built.</p></li><li><p>Using simulation software can help to identify safety issues by providing data about how different mechanical components will interact in a wide variety of situations.</p></li><li><p>The manufacturer can present simulation software to customers to demonstrate different design possibilities.</p></li></ol>",
