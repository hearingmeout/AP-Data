The exhibit is intended to allow guests to select the name of an animal on a touch screen and display various facts about the selected animal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">For example, if a guest selects the animal name “wolf,” the exhibit is intended to display the following information.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Classification: mammal</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Skin type: fur</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Thermoregulation: warm-blooded</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Lifestyle: pack</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Average life span: 10–12 years</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Top speed: 75 kilometers/hour</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The preserve has two databases of information available to use for the exhibit. The first database contains information for each animal’s name, classification, skin type, and thermoregulation. The second database contains information for each animal’s name, lifestyle, average life span, and top speed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following explains how the two databases can be used to develop the interactive exhibit?</p>\n",
