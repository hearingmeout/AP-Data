The specifications for the algorithm are as follows.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">The gate should not open when the time is outside of business hours.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">The motor should not turn on unless the gate sensor is activated.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">The motor should not turn on if the gate is already open.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following algorithms can be used to open the gate under the appropriate conditions?</p>\n",
