The vertical axis represents, x of t and ranges from negative 2 through 2, in increments of 1. A line is plotted on the graph, which starts from the point (0, negative 0.5), declines to the point, (1, negative 1.5). The line then steadily rises with a positive slope, passes through the point (3, 0), and peaks at the point (5, 1). The line then declines and culminates at the point (6, 0.5).
