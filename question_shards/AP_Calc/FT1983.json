The graph is concave up and increasing from a point in the third quadrant to a.  From a to c, the graph is decreasing and concave up, dropping below the x-axis and forming a cusp at some positive y-value where x = a.  At x = b, the graph travels through an open circle at some positive y-value at x = b.  At x = b, there is also a closed circle at a y value above the open circle.  From c to d, the graph is increasing and concave up, ending at an closed circle at some positive y-value at x = d.  At x = d, there is also an open circle at some negative y value, and from that point the graph continues, increasing and concave up.\" src=\"/images/a7bb53260185ba3fcb693f0cebdb2dc8.png\"></p><p>The graph of a function <em>f</em> is shown above.
