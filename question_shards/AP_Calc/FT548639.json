The verticals axis represents Barrels per Hour and ranges from 0 through 200, in increments of 100. The curve starts from the point (0, 90) and remains constant until the point (4, 0). It then rises steadily, passes through the point (6, 100), and peaks at the point (12, 200). The curve then steadily declines through the points (18, 100) and (20, 90). It remains constant until the point (24, 90).
