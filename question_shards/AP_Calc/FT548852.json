In the first pair of graphs, the graph of the left shows a concave upward rising curve labeled f, which rises from a point on the x-axis in quadrant 2 to a positive value on the y-axis in quadrant 1. On the right, the graph shows a concave upward rising curve labeled f prime, which is identical to the first curve. In the second pair of graphs, the graph on the left shows a downward open parabola, labeled f, plotted in all the four quadrants, with its vertex on the positive y-axis. On the right, the graph shows a similar parabola, labeled f prime, with its vertex closer to the origin as compared to the first parabola. In the third pair of graphs, the graph on the left shows a downward open parabola in quadrant 1, labeled f. Both its intercepts are on the x-axis. On the right, the graph shows a curve, labeled f prime, declining from quadrant 1 and to quadrant 4. It starts from a positive value on the y-axis, dips, intersects the x-axis, and extends below the x-axis.\" height=\"408\" src=\"/images/5e4a8f55a940fcb069dc4f24351fadb6.png\" width=\"322\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following pairs of graphs could represent the graph of a function and the graph of its derivative?</p>\n",
