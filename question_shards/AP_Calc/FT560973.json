There are evenly spaced tick marks on the vertical axis labeled negative 3 through 1. The graph consists of a curve and a shaded region. The curve begins in the first quadrant just above the horizontal axis and to the left of 1. It moves down, intersects the horizontal axis at 1, and continues down before leveling off near 2 comma negative three. It then curves up, intersecting the horizontal axis again at 3, and ends just above the horizontal axis to the right of 3.
