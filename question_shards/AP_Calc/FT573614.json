One line segment begins at the coordinates zero comma 2 and moves down and to the right, crossing the x axis at the coordinates 2 comma zero, and ending at the coordinates 4 comma negative 2. A second line segment begins at the coordinates 4 comma negative 2, and moves up and to the right, ending at the coordinates 5 comma zero. A third line segment begins at the coordinates 5 comma zero, and moves up and to the right, ending at the coordinates 6 comma 4. \" height=\"299\" src=\"/images/4df25cc70b80c31886547e9694411f52.png\" width=\"315\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph of the function <em>f</em>, shown above, consists of three line segments.
