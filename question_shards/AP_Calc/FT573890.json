The graph curves gradually down and to the right, passing through the x axis at x equals 2, and reaches a minimum at x equals 3. The graph then curves gradually up and to the right, passing through the x axis at x equals 4, and reaches a local maximum at approximately x equals 4.5 that is approximately half as high as the maximum at x equals one.
