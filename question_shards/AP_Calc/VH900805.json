The numbers 1 through 9, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 1 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of a curve and two line segments. Two open circles and two closed circles are included in the graph. The curve begins above the x axis and to the left of the y axis. It moves downward and to the right, crossing the y axis at 2. It continues downward until it reaches an open circle at the point with approximate coordinates 1 comma 1.2. The curve begins again, and reaches a minimum at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1. At this point, it moves upward and to the right until it reaches a closed circle at the point with approximate coordinates 5 comma 3.2. Below this closed circle is a second open circle at the point with coordinates 5 comma 2. The first line segment begins at this open circle at the point with coordinates 5 comma 2, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at a third open circle at the point with coordinates 7 comma 0. Above this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 7 comma 1. The second line segment begins at the open circle at the point with coordinates 7 comma 0, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at a point above the x axis.\" height=\"239\" src=\"/images/d6cb523c9793fb945ea8efd3b231135e.png\" width=\"335\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
