The horizontal axis is labeled t, and the numbers 1 through 10, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled v of t, and there are no values indicated on the axis. The curve begins at the origin, and moves downward and to the right. It levels off at approximately t equals 1, just below the horizontal axis. It then moves upward and to the right, crossing the horizontal axis at t equals 2, and continuing upward until it levels off at approximately t equals 4.5, high above the horizontal axis. The curve then moves downward and to the right, crossing the horizontal axis at t equals 7, and continues downward until it levels off at approximately t equals 9, far below the horizontal axis.
