The curve then falls to a minimum point on the negative y axis, rises to a maximum point in the first quadrant through the positive x axis. The curve falls down into the fourth quadrant beyond the point x equals b.The graph of y equals g prime of x is a curve that originates in the third quadrant below the negative x axis and beyond the point a comma 0, bends down to a point, and further rises steadily upward through the origin to a maximum point in the first quadrant. The curve falls down, bends and levels off as it approaches the axis and beyond the point b comma 0.The graph of y equals h prime of x is a bell shaped curve that originates above the negative x axis and beyond the point a comma 0, rises to a maximum point on the positive y axis, and ends above the positive x axis and beyond the point b comma 0.\" src=\"/images/d26b45a06cee56f6eda3aea8dcd8ec1d.png\"></p><p>The graphs of the derivatives of the functions <em>f, g</em>, and <em>h</em> are shown above.
