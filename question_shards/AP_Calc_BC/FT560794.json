The first and steepest column of parallel segments have midpoints at the coordinates, from top to bottom, negative 1 comma 2, negative 1 comma 1, and negative 1 comma zero. For each of these segments, one endpoint is a quarter unit to the left and a half unit above the midpoint, and one endpoint is a quarter unit to the right and a half unit below the midpoint. The second column of parallel segments have midpoints on the y axis at 2, 1 and the origin. For each of these segments, one endpoint is a half unit to the left and a quarter unit above the midpoint, and the other endpoint is a half unit to the right and a quarter unit below the midpoint. The third column of parallel segments have midpoints at the coordinates, from top to bottom,  1 comma 2, 1 comma 1, and 1 comma zero. The exact location of the two endpoints of each of these segments is not specified. For each of these segments, one endpoint is more than a half unit to the left and slightly above the midpoint, and the other endpoint is more than a half unit to the right and slightly below the midpoint.\" height=\"310\" src=\"/images/02c5b2fc3187cdc2782939bb707d7519.png\" width=\"325\"></p>\n\n<p>A slope field for a differential equation is shown in the figure above.
