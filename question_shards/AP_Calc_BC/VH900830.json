The numbers negative 3 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of two line segments and a curve. There are two open circles and two closed circles included in the graph. The first line segment begins below the x axis, and to the right of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right, crossing the x axis at negative 3, and passing through the point with coordinates negative 2 comma 1. It continues upward until it ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates negative 1 comma 2. Below this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates negative 1 comma 0. The curve begins at the open circle at the point with coordinates negative 1 comma 2, and moves downward and to the right until it reaches a minimum on the y axis at 1. At this point, the curve moves upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates 1 comma 2, and ends at a second open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 5. Below this open circle is a second closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 2. The second line segment begins at this closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 2, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 3 comma 1, crosses the x axis at 4, and ends just below the x axis.\" height=\"250\" src=\"/images/d6944b54c3d36e52846a2cd73bb08a48.png\" width=\"266\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
