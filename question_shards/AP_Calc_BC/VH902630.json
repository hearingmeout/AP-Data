The numbers negative 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated on both axes. The graph consists of two curves. Two open circles and a closed circle are included in the graph. The first curve begins below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates negative 1 comma negative 1. It continues upward and crosses the x axis at approximately negative one half, crosses the y axis at 1, and passes through the point with coordinates 1 comma 3. It then begins to level off before it ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 4. Below this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 3. Below the closed circle is a second open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1. The second curve begins at this open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1, and moves upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates 4 comma 4.
