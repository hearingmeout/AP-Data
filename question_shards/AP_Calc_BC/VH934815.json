The numbers negative 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers 1 and 2 are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of three line segments. Three open circles and four closed circles are included in the graph. The first line segment begins at a closed circle on the x axis at negative 1, and moves upward and to the right, passing through an open circle on the y axis at 1. It continues upward and to the right, until it ends at another open circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma 2. The second line segment begins at a closed circle on the x axis at 1, and moves upward and to the right, passing through an open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1. It continues upward and to the right, until it ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 2. The third line segment begins at the closed circle where the second line segment ends, moves downward and to the right, and ends at a closed circle on the x axis at 5.\" height=\"111\" src=\"/images/b29fe34d95edccb11b5dff20add7b4bb.png\" width=\"165\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
