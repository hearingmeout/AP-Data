The single bond between oxygen and one hydrogen atom is marked as A. The second structure shows O single bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group. The single bond between the two oxygen atoms is marked as B. One hydrogen atom is further single bonded to another hydrogen atom marked as C. The hydrogen atom is then single bonded to another oxygen atom which is single bonded to a hydrogen atom. The third structure shows an oxygen atom single bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The single bond between oxygen and one hydrogen atom is marked as D.
