The second vessel contains N e. The vessel has two bigger atoms. The third vessel contains H e. The vessel has 12 smaller atoms. The resultant 2 liter vessel is left blank. \" height=\"113\" src=\"/images/7769831b3c4dd6951772bd145f003415.png\" width=\"415\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above represents three sealed 1.0 L vessels, each containing a different inert gas at 298 K. The pressure of Ar in the first vessel is 2.0 atm. The ratio of the numbers of Ar, Ne, and He atoms in the vessels is 2:1:6, respectively. After all the gases are combined in a previously evacuated 2.0 L vessel, what is the total pressure of the gases at 298 K?</p>\n",
