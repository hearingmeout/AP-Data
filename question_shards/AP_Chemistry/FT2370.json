    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"A diagram shows three steps of the dissolution of an ionic solute in a polar solvent. Step 1 shows the increase in gap between the ions in the solute. Step 2 shows the expansion of the polar solvent. Empty spaces are created inside the solvent. Step 3 shows the combining of the ionic solute and the polar solvent. The expanded ions occupy the empty spaces inside the polar solvent. \" height=\"474\" src=\"/images/6b4f7c20c2559903d69534677f141e10.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n\n<p>The dissolution of an ionic solute in a polar solvent can be imagined as occurring in three steps, as shown in the figure above. In step 1, the separation between ions in the solute is greatly increased, just as will occur when the solute dissolves in the polar solvent. In step 2, the polar solvent is expanded to make spaces that the ions will occupy. In the last step, the ions are inserted into the spaces in the polar solvent. Which of the following best describes the enthalpy change, Δ<em>H, </em>for each step?</p>\n",
