The vertical axis plots Concentration of X or Y, in mol times L inverse, from 0.05 through 4.05. The curve for Y is a horizontal line starting from the point (0, 4.00). The curve for X has a concave upward declining trend and falls through the following estimated points: (0, 0.20), (1, 0.10), (2, 0.05), (3, 0.025), (4, 0.0125).\" height=\"251\" src=\"/images/e8350aadcb82583352c5dc3002b7ed31.png\" width=\"255\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the results of a study of the reaction of <em>X</em> with a large excess of <em>Y</em> to yield <em>Z</em>.
