    "prompt": "A kinetics experiment is set up to collect the gas that is generated when a sample of chalk, consisting primarily of solid CaCO<sub>3</sub>, is added to a solution of ethanoic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH. The rate of reaction between CaCO<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is determined by measuring the volume of gas generated at 22<sup>o</sup>C and 1 atm as a function of time. Which of the following experimental conditions is most likely to increase the rate of gas production?",
