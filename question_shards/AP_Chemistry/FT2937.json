    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows two graphs with the horizontal axis labeled Binding Energy, in electron volts, and the vertical axis labeled Relative Number of Electrons. The relative number of electrons increases from bottom to top on the vertical axis, but binding energy decreases from left to right.  The top graph is labeled Nitrogen. The graph shows one peak at a binding energy of about 410 electron volts.  The bottom graph is labeled Oxygen. The graph shows one peak at a binding energy of about 540 electron volts.  The peaks in the two graphs are approximately the same height.\" height=\"296\" src=\"/images/9116d6adfa4f4894ed5292b9105b785d.png\" width=\"385\"></p>\n\n<p>The photoelectron spectra above show the energy required to remove a 1<em>s</em> electron from a nitrogen atom and from an oxygen atom. Which of the following statements best accounts for the peak in the upper spectrum being to the right of the peak in the lower spectrum?</p>\n",
