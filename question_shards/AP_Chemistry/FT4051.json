    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a graph with the horizontal axis labeled molar concentration and the vertical axis labeled absorbance. Concentration increases from zero point zero zero zero to one point two zero zero from the origin to the right, and absorbance increases from zero point zero zero to zero point seven zero from the origin up. There are five points plotted on the graph. A best fit line begins at the origin and moves up and to the right, intersecting 4 of the 5 points. The point in the middle, from left to right, which corresponds to a concentration of zero point six zero zero molar, is significantly above the line.\" height=\"628\" src=\"/images/ca048b5a8731d5940ac3816e9a632846.png\" width=\"355\"></p>\n\n<p>A student prepared five solutions of CuSO<sub>4</sub> with different concentrations, and then filled five cuvettes, each containing one of the solutions. The cuvettes were placed in a spectrophotometer set to the appropriate wavelength for maximum absorbance. The absorbance of each solution was measured and recorded. The student plotted absorbance versus concentration, as shown in the figure above. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the variance of the data point for the 0.600 <em>M</em> CuSO<sub>4</sub> solution?</p>\n",
