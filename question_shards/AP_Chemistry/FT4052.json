    "prompt": "<p>Thymine and adenine form a base pair in the DNA molecule. These two bases can form a connection between two strands of DNA via two hydrogen bonds. Which of the following diagrams shows the correct representation of the hydrogen bonding (denoted by dashed lines) between thymine and adenine base pairs? (In each diagram, thymine is shown at the left and adenine is shown at the right. The bases are attached to the backbone portion of the DNA strands.)</p>",
