Intensity increases up the vertical axis but binding energy DECREASES from left to right. The graph shows two major peaks, each labeled one s. The peak on the left, at a binding energy of about 68 megajoules per mole, is labeled peak X. The peak on the right, at a binding energy of about 28 megajoules per mole, is labeled peak Y, and is roughly one seventh the height of peak X.\" height=\"351\" src=\"/images/4a9b3fef2ff03ebb19a67a114453788e.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p>A sample containing atoms of C and F was analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
