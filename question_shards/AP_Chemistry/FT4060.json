    "prompt": "<p>Steel is an alloy consisting of Fe with a small amount of C. Elemental Cr can be added to steel to make the steel less likely to rust; Cr atoms react with oxygen in the air to form a nonreactive layer of chromium oxide on the surface of the steel, preventing the oxidation of underlying Fe atoms. A sample of steel-chromium alloy contains 15 percent Cr by mass. Which of the following diagrams best shows a particle-level view of a surface section and an interior section of the alloy represented below at the left? (The atomic radii of the atoms involved are given in the table below at the right.)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"Option A. The diagram on the left shows twenty large circles in 4 rows and 5 columns. The circles are not touching each other and are labeled F e.
