There are evenly spaced tick marks along the horizontal axis labeled from 0 to 35 in increments of 5, from left to right.  There are evenly spaced tick marks along the vertical axis labeled from 0 to 14 in increments of 2, from bottom to top.  The line on the graph starts on the vertical axis at about p H equals 3.  The line slopes up gradually to the right until it reaches a p H of about 5.7 at approximately 23 m L. The slope of the line increases quickly until it is almost vertical from 26 to 27 m L, and then the line starts to flatten at a volume of about 29 m L and p H of about 13.  The line continues horizontally and ends at the right side of the graph.\" height=\"282\" src=\"/images/b4591dfee31bf5affa518b5770249c54.png\" width=\"465\"></p>\n\n<p>A student performs an acid-base titration and plots the experimental results in the graph above.
