    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"Each figure shows a particle representation of the mixing of M g solid and H C L aqueous.  In figure 1, M g particles are arranged in a parallelogram shape to represent one large piece of  M g containing many M g atoms. There are chloride (C L with a charge of negative 1) ions and hydronium (H 3 O with a charge of positive 1) ions scattered around the large piece of M g.    In figure 2, there are multiple small groups of M g atoms that represent smaller pieces of M g than the single large piece of M g shown in figure 1. There are chloride ions and hydronium ions scattered around and between the small M g groups.\" height=\"465\" src=\"/images/dc417f3dae36412ed7656e3fd08b3f18.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p>Two samples of Mg<em>(s) </em>of equal mass were placed in equal amounts of HCI<em>(aq) </em>contained in two separate reaction vessels.
