The horizontal axis is labeled “Atomic Mass, in a m u,” and the numbers 88 through 98, in increments of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Percent Abundance,” and the numbers 0, 50, and 100 are indicated. The 4 horizontal lines from left to right are as follows. Note all values are approximate. The first line begins on the horizontal axis at 90 a m u, and extends to 52 percent. The second line begins on the horizontal axis at 91 a m u, and extends to 11 percent. The third line begins on the horizontal axis at 92 a m u, and extends to 17 percent.
