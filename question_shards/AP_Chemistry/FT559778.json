    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure presents two compounds. The compound on the left is titled “Compound 1, and the compound on the right is titled “Compound 2.” Compound 1 begins with a C H 3 connected with a single bond to a C H 2, which is connected with a single bond to an N atom, which has one pair of nonbonding electrons. The N atom is connected with single bonds to two C H 3 groups. Compound 2 begins with a C H 3 connected with a single bond to a C H 2. The C H 2 is connected with a single bond to another C H 2, which is connected with a single bond to another C H 2. The last C H 2 is connected with a single bond to an N atom, which has one pair of nonbonding electrons. The N atom is also connected with single bonds to two H atoms. \" height=\"121\" src=\"/images/e83f106ae52ccf27913d83243830ff66.png\" width=\"555\"></p>\n\n<p>Based on the structures shown above, which of the following statements identifies the compound with the higher boiling point and provides the best explanation for the higher boiling point?</p>\n",
