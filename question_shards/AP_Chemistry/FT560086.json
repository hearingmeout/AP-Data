This ring is connected to an N H 2 molecule by a single-bond. The second compound is a six-membered planar ring with an N H molecule in it. Two double bonds from either side of the  N H molecule connect to two oxygen atoms. This N H molecule interacts with the Nitrogen atom in the first compound. The oxygen atom to the right of the N H molecule interacts with one of the Hydrogen atoms in the N H 2 molecule connected to the first compound.\" height=\"143\" src=\"/images/eed4d3fb55fae6dc084a5b452df21627.png\" width=\"282\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following is the strongest type of interaction that occurs between the atoms within the circled areas of the two molecules represented above?</p>\n",
