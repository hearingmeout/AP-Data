The diagram shows a filter paper with its lower end immersed in Hexane (C 6 H 14). At t equals 0, a solid dot, above the hexane level, represents a pigment sample on the filter paper. At t equals 30 minutes, two ovals for components X and Y, respectively, appear one below another on the filter paper.\" height=\"179\" src=\"/images/9c738eca7b7cbcf43b2bed80c6dd91d1.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p>In a paper chromatography experiment, a sample of a pigment is separated into two components, X and Y, as shown in the figure above. The surface of the paper is moderately polar. What can be concluded about X and Y based on the experimental results?</p>\n",
