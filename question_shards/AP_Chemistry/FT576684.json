The heading for column 1 is “Compound Name.” The heading for column 2 is “Structural Formula.” The heading for column 3 is “Molar Mass, in grams per mole.” There are 3 rows of data in the table. The data are as follows.  Row 1. Compound Name, Butanal. Structural Formula, the molecule has 4 C atoms arranged horizontally, connected to each other with single bonds. The first C atom also has 3 H atoms connected to it with single bonds. The second and third C atoms each have 2 H atoms connected to them with single bonds. The fourth C atom has one O atom connected to it with a double bond and one H atom connected to it with a single bond. The O atom has two pairs of nonbonding electrons. Molar Mass, 72.10 grams per mole.  Row 2. Compound Name, Pentane. Structural Formula, the molecule has 5 C atoms arranged horizontally, connected to each other with single bonds. The first C atom has 3 H atoms connected to it with single bonds. The second, third, and fourth C atoms each have 2 H atoms connected to them with single bonds.  The fifth C atom has 3 H atoms connected to it with single bonds. Molar Mass, 72.15 grams per mole.  Row 3. Compound Name, Propanoic acid. Structural Formula, the molecule has 3 C atoms arranged horizontally, connected to each other with single bonds. The first C atom has 3 H atoms connected to it with single bonds. The second C atom has 2 H atoms connected to it with single bonds. The third C atom has one O atom connected to it with a double bond and one O atom connected to it with a single bond. The O atom that is connected with a single bond has an H atom connected to it with a single bond. Both O atoms have two pairs of nonbonding electrons.
