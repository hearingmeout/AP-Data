    "prompt": "<p> The temperature of the CH<sub>3</sub>OH is increased from 300 K to 400 K to vaporize all the liquid, which increases the pressure in the vessel to 0.30 atm. The experiment is repeated under identical conditions but this time using half the mass of CH<sub>3</sub>OH that was used originally. What will be the pressure in the vessel at 400 K ? </p>",
