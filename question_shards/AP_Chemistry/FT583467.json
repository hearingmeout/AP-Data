A negative sign is drawn in each of the shaded circles, and a positive sign is drawn in each of the unshaded circles. The circles are arranged in 4 rows. The first row contains 4 shaded circles that are close to each other but do not touch. The second row contains 4 unshaded circles, which touch the shaded circles and are shifted to the right of the first row of circles so that they are below the spaces between the circles in the first row. The third row contains 4 shaded circles, each one directly below (but not touching) one of the shaded circles in the first row. They touch the unshaded circles in the second row. The fourth row contains 4 unshaded circles, each one directly below (but not touching) one of the unshaded circles in the second row.
