The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in minutes,” and the numbers 0 through 120, in increments of 20, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Molar Concentration of X,” and the numbers 0.0 through 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The curve begins at the top of the vertical axis and moves downward and to the right steeply and then less steeply until it ends slightly above the end of the horizontal axis. There are 7 data points on the curve. The data points, from left to right, are as follows. Note that all values are approximate.   Data point 1. 0 minutes, 1.0 molar. Data point 2. 20 minutes, 0.5 molar. Data point 3. 40 minutes, 0.25 molar. Data point 4. 60 minutes, 0.13 molar. Data point 5. 80 minutes, 0.06 molar. Data point 6. 100 minutes, 0.03 molar.
