The students took a 100.0 mL sample of the solution and added an excess of 1.0 <em>M </em>Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>(<em>aq</em>), causing the Cu<sup>2+</sup>(<em>aq</em>) to precipitate as Cu<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(<em>s</em>), as shown in step 1 below.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Step 1</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram labeled Step 1. The diagram contains 3 beakers arranged horizontally. From left to right, the diagram indicates that the contents of the first two beakers are added together to produce the contents of the third beaker. The reaction is also represented by an equation written below the diagram. In the diagram, the first beaker is labeled blue green C u with a positive 2 charge, aqueous. This is added to the second beaker, which is labeled colorless 1.0 molar N a 3 P O 4, aqueous. The reaction of the contents of the first two beakers produces the contents of the third beaker, which is labeled blue green C u 3, open parenthesis, P O 4, close parenthesis, 2, solid.   The equation written below the diagram is as follows: 3 C u with a positive 2 charge, aqueous, plus 2 N a 3 P O 4, aqueous, react to produce C u 3, open parenthesis, P O 4, close parenthesis, 2, solid, plus 6 N a with a positive one charge, aqueous.\" height=\"171\" src=\"/images/5872ce09cff70b46daa9bbb8e74ebe00.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n\n<p>The Cu<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(<em>s</em>) was filtered, dried, and weighed.
