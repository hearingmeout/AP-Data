    "prompt": "<p>A student pipetted five 25.00–milliliter samples of hydrochloric acid and transferred each sample to an Erlenmeyer flask, diluted it with distilled wa­ter, and added a few drops of phenolphthalein to each. Each sample was then titrated with a sodium hy­droxide solution to the appearance of the first per­manent faint pink color. The following results were obtained. \n<br>\t<br>Volumes of NaOH Solution\n<br>\tFirst Sample.....35.22 mL\n<br>\tSecond Sample.....36.14 mL\n<br>\tThird Sample.....36.13 mL\n<br>\tFourth Sample\t.....36.15 mL\n<br>\tFifth Sample.....36.12 mL\n<br>\t<br>Which of the following is the most probable ex­pla­na­tion for the variation in the student’s results?</p>",
