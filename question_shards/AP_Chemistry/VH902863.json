The first snapshot presents the lattice of 16 particles in a 4 by 4 square. There are 8 positively charged particles and 8 negatively charged particles, and each are arranged such that a positive particle only touches a negative particle, and vice versa. The second snapshot presents two forces disfiguring the lattice. The first force is pointing to the right, into the upper half of the left side of the lattice. The second force is pointing to the left, into the lower half of the right side of the lattice. The upper and lower halves of the lattice have shifted such that along the edge where they meet, each positively charged particle is in contact with another positively charged particle, and each negatively charged particle is in contact with another negatively charged particle. The third snapshot presents the upper and lower halves of the lattice completely separated. Double headed arrows are drawn between pairs of particles that were previously in contact in the second snapshot. Next to the arrows, the note Layers Repel is given.\" height=\"153\" src=\"/images/a91e0c45f9a9d6578d507e55f973a2cb.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The particulate-level diagram shown above best helps to explain which of the following properties of ionic solids?</p>\n",
