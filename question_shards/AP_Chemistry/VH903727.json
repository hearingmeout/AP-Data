The top two rows are offset to the right of the bottom two rows so that the two rightmost columns in the top two rows do not have particles below them in the bottom two rows. Likewise, the two leftmost columns in the bottom two rows do not have particles above them in the top two rows. The positively charged particles are in a shaded region, labeled Electron Sea. Two arrows are drawn on the figure.
