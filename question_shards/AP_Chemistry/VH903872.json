The vertical axis is labeled Relative Number of Electrons and no values are indicated. The line moves horizontally to the right along the horizontal axis and has 3 peaks. The data of the 3 peaks are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Peak 1, 50 megajoules per mole. Peak 2, 4 megajoules per mole. Peak 3, 2 megajoules per mole.
