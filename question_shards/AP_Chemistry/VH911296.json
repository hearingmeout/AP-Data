Each diagram contains two different gases. One gas is represented by gray circles, and the other is represented by white circles. The Initial diagram shows a container divided in half by a removable barrier; gray circles are on the left and white circles are on the right. An arrow drawn from Initial to Final indicates a change. In the Final diagram, the removable barrier is gone and gray circles are intermingled with white circles.\" height=\"154\" src=\"/images/0159cadc7c12cbfa54093c48d48b59a1.png\" width=\"420\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Diagram 1 above shows equimolar samples of two gases inside a container fitted with a removable barrier placed so that each gas occupies the same volume. The barrier is carefully removed as the temperature is held constant. Diagram 2 above shows the gases soon after the barrier is removed. Which statement describes the changes to the initial pressure of each gas and the final partial pressure of each gas in the mixture and also indicates the final total pressure?</p>\n",
