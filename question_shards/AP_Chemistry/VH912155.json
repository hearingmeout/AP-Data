The horizontal axis is labeled Volume and the vertical axis is labeled Pressure. A curve drawn with a solid line is labeled, Real Gas, and begins at the top of the vertical axis, steeply decreases, almost parallel the vertical axis, then begins to curve gradually downward and to the right, finishing parallel to the horizontal axis. A curve drawn with a dashed line is labeled, Ideal Gas, and begins at the top of the vertical axis and to the left of the Real Gas curve. The Ideal Gas curve steeply decreases, almost parallel to the vertical axis, and then begins to curve gradually downward and to the right, finishing parallel to the horizontal axis and slightly higher than the Real Gas curve.\" height=\"276\" src=\"/images/7480b15b4dfcf1fca0c96fe264c48e5f.png\" width=\"350\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows how a particular real gas deviates from ideal behavior at very high pressures.
