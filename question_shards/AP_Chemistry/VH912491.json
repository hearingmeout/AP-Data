The first curve is a bolded line that begins near the origin and moves drastically upward and to the right, reaching its peak roughly 10% across the horizontal axis and 95% up the vertical axis, then moves drastically downward and to the right, reaching the lowest point at roughly 25% across the horizontal access, after which it moves horizontally to the right until reaching the rightmost point on the vertical axis. The second curve is a nonbolded line that begins near the origin and moves very steeply upward and to the right, reaching its peak roughly 20% across the horizontal axis and 50% up the vertical axis, then moves very steeply downward and to the right, reaching the lowest point at roughly 30% across the horizontal access, after which it moves horizontally to the right until reaching the rightmost point on the vertical axis. The third curve is a dashed line that begins at the origin and moves steeply upward and to the right, reaching its peak roughly 30% across the horizontal axis and 30% up the vertical axis, then moves steeply downward and to the right, reaching the lowest point approximately 50% across the vertical axis and moving horizontally until reaching the rightmost point on the horizontal axis. The fourth curve is a dotted line that begins near the origin and gradually moves upward and to the right, reaching its maximum point halfway across the horizontal axis and roughly 25% up the vertical axis, before gradually moving downward and to the right, ending at the rightmost part of the horizontal axis and at the lowest point on the vertical axis.\" height=\"294\" src=\"/images/2ce1102aa95549c4051e0bc58cd9b187.png\" width=\"450\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the distribution of molecular speeds for four different gases at the same temperature.
