The horizontal axis is labeled “Wavelength, in nanometers,” and the numbers 300 through 700, in increments of 50, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Absorbance,” and the numbers 0 through 1.2, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The curve begins slightly above 0.2 on the vertical axis and moves downward and to the right, reaching a local minimum at an absorbance of 0.08 at 380 nanometers on the horizontal axis. The curve then moves steeply upward and to the right and reaches a maximum just above an absorbance of 1.0 at 535 nanometers on the horizontal axis. The curve then moves steeply downward and to the right, and levels off as it approaches the horizontal axis.\" height=\"341\" src=\"/images/2e546b4e364551baa5a00718a867b5df.png\" width=\"450\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The absorption spectrum of a certain red dye is shown above. If a student analyzing the same concentration of this dye neglected to wipe fingerprints off the cuvette before placing it in the spectrophotometer, how would the absorption curve be affected?</p>\n",
