    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">For a classroom demonstration, a chemistry teacher puts samples of two different pure solid powders in a beaker. The teacher places the beaker on a small wooden board with a wet surface, then stirs the contents of the beaker. After a short time the students observe that the bottom of the beaker is frozen to the wood surface. The teacher asks the students to make a claim about the observation and to justify their claims. Which of the following is the best claim and justification based on the students’ observation?</p>\n",
