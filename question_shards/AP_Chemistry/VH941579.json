A key indicates a gray circle equals N, a black circle equals O, and a small white circle equals H.&nbsp; Each step has a box on the left with particles representing the reactants and a box on the right with particles representing the products. In Step 1, the box on the left has a black and gray circle connected to each other, plus a gray and black circle connected to each other.&nbsp;The box on the right has a black circle connected to a gray circle which is connected to a gray circle which is connected to a black circle. The reactants are in equilibrium with the products.&nbsp;In Step 2, the box on the left has a black circle connected to a gray circle which is connected to a gray circle which is connected to a black circle, plus 2 white circles that are connected to each other. &nbsp;The box on the right has a black circle connected to a gray circle which is connected to a gray circle, plus one black circle connected to 2 white circles. The reactants produce the products. In Step 3, the box on the left has a gray circle connected to a gray circle which is connected to a black circle, plus 2 white circles connected to each other. The box on the right has 2 gray circles connected to each other, plus one black circle connected to 2 white circles.
