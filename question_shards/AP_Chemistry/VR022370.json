There is a Lewis diagram of the anion. There is a row of atoms, N, C, and C, connected by single bonds. The N atom is connected to two H atoms, each by a single bond, and has a nonbonding pair of electrons. The C atom on the left is connected to two H atoms by single bonds. The C atom on the right is connected to two O atoms, one by a single bond, and the other by a double bond. The O atom connected by a single bond has three nonbonding pairs of electrons, and the O atom connected by a double bond has two nonbonding pairs of electrons. The structure of the anion has brackets around it, and there is a minus sign at the top right, indicating that the species has a negative one charge.\" height=\"130\" src=\"/images/9db7bdf7cc95670bfd3903bee003dcce.png\" width=\"250\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements is true about sodium glycinate, represented above?</p>\n",
