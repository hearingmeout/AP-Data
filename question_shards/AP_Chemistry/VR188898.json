The structure on the left shows one N atom and two C atoms arranged horizontally at its center. The atoms are connected by single bonds. The N atom is connected to three H atoms, each by a single bond. The first C atom is connected to two H atoms, each by a single bond. The second C atom is connected to two O atoms. One of the O atoms, which extends above the second C atom, is connected by a double bond and has two pairs of nonbonding electrons. The other O atom, which extends to the right of the second C atom, is connected by a single bond and has three pairs of nonbonding electrons. A double headed arrow is drawn between the two structures. The structure on the right shows one N atom and two C atoms arranged horizontally at its center. The atoms are connected by single bonds.
