In the diagram labeled Before, there are four rows of alternating unshaded, small cations and shaded, large anions stacked on top of each other with no space between the rows. Two arrows are shown. One arrow points toward the top two rows from the left, and one arrow points toward the bottom two rows from the right. In the diagram labeled After, the top two rows of cations and anions are separated from the bottom two rows, and the top two rows are positioned to the right of the bottom two rows. The cations at the bottom of the top two rows align with the cations at the top of the bottom two rows. The anions are also aligned.\" src=\"/images/ecb90a3d54c47e7737763a0bee26faea.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">When a stress is applied to an ionic crystal, the planes of the ions slide and separate due to the alignment of like charges, as shown in the diagram above. Which of the following characteristics of the crystal is represented by the observation?</p>\n",
