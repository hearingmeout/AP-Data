Compound 1 contains a chain of five atoms connected by single bonds. From left to right the atoms are as follows: C, C, O, C, and C. The first and last C atoms are each connected to three H atoms by single bonds. The other two C atoms are each connected to two H atoms by single bonds. Compound 2 contains a chain of four C atoms connected by single bonds. The first C atom is connected to three H atoms by single bonds. The next two C atoms are each connected to two H atoms by single bonds. The rightmost C atom is connected to two H atoms by single bonds and to an O atom by a single bond.
