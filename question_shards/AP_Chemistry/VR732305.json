      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Metal atoms are spherical; therefore, the solid metal can be easily drawn into wires that have a round cross-section.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Because of strongly directional bonding in the solid metal, the atoms both in front of and behind a given atom in a wire will bind together more strongly than the atoms not along the direction of the wire.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Because the mobile electrons attract the metal cations equally in all directions, the metal cations can move easily past one another as the metal is drawn into a wire.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Metal atoms tend to be much smaller than nonmetal atoms; therefore, they can move easily past one another as the metal is drawn into a wire.</p>",
