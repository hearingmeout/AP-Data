The first map shows 11 to 20 inhabitants per square kilometer in major parts of Castile, extending from the north to the south. Two provinces in the south are marked with less than 10 inhabitants per square kilometer. A small region in the north of Castile is marked with over 30 inhabitants per square kilometer. Few regions along it are marked with 21 to 30 inhabitants per square kilometer. The second map shows few provinces in the north of Castile with less than 300 inhabitants per square kilometer. A few regions that lie on the north alongside Aragon are marked with 300 to 400 inhabitants per square kilometer. The central regions of Castile extending from west to the east are marked with 400 to 450 inhabitants per square kilometer.
