From left to right the symbols are as follows: A bull is depicted with a dark body and white head. The bull appears to be stunned or shocked at the horror surrounding him. Underneath the image of the bull sits a woman clutching a dead child, her head facing the sky in an anguished cry with her eyes in the shape of tears. A pigeon is shown between the bull and the horse. A dead soldier is also pictured, holding a broken sword and a flower in the hand. A horse is shown situated in the center of the painting. A kneeling woman is shown with an injured leg appearing to be dislocated or broken. She is bleeding from the knee although she is trying to stop the flow with her hand. A woman in oil lamp is further shown, with her face appearing from the oil lamp illuminating the painting. Her face appears to be in a state of shock and bewilderment. An imploring man is at the far right of the painting pleading at the sky, perhaps at the German planes above to stop the bombing.\" src=\"/images/a09938b4013751a99596df3dc2162318.png\"></p><p>The picture above does which of the following?</p>",
