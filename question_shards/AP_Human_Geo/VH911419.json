A key at the bottom of the map is labeled Population Density per Square Kilometer, and the following four categories are indicated: over 1,000, 100 to 1,000, 10 to 100, and less than 10. Lakes are also indicated in the key. A scale above the key represents the distance from 0 to 500 miles. The map includes portions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. The most densely populated areas appear around Lake Victoria in the countries of Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. Areas around Lake Nyasa in the bottom part of the map are more densely populated than other areas of the map.\" height=\"428\" src=\"/images/af39c8a9a44137a18f019bcbd45d1445.png\" width=\"570\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best identifies the data for the Eastern Great Rift Valley, shown on the map?</p>\n",
