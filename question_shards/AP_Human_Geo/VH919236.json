The first map is a topographic map. The topographic map shows a top down view of the area surrounding the mountain indicating the various heights of the area that lead up to the peak of the mountain. The heights in the area range from 9,200 at the outermost regions of the map, to a peak of 14,179 in the upper right portion of the map. The second map is a geographic information systems map image. This image shows a view from the base of the mountain looking up to its peak.\" height=\"1053\" src=\"/images/3f3cacc27eaeccdbc6f8f68ca27fccf8.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The images show a topographic map and a geographic information systems (GIS) representation of Mount Shasta in California.
