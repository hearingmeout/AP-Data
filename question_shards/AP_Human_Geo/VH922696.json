Population is measured along the horizontal axis from 0 to 2,500,000, in increments of 500,000. The data represented by the pyramid are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The shape of the pyramid is symmetrical about the vertical axis. The largest age group is 0 through 4, peaking just below 2,000,000 for both male and female population. Both male and female populations decrease gradually and evenly in each age group, ending at just above 0 for the 100 plus age group.\" height=\"449\" src=\"/images/0aaeaaa7c5a5bf2e7ef18c558ccec216.png\" width=\"700\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Source: United States Census Bureau</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following patterns is indicated by the population pyramid shown?</p>\n",
