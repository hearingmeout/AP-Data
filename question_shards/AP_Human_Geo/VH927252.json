      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">This practice will likely spread via hierarchical diffusion when the president of the United States signs an executive order banning plastic straws in all states.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">This practice will likely spread via social media and stimulus diffusion when other states enact identical laws banning plastic straws.</p>",
