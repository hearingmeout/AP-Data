The writer drafted the following thesis statement, which is intended to preview the line of reasoning the new passage would have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Though it is true that Tyler studied six separate works of art, <u>including such famous works as Vitruvian Man and Salvator Mundi</u>, there is not enough evidence to prove that da Vinci suffered from exotropia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Should the writer include the underlined portion of the thesis statement?</p>\n",
