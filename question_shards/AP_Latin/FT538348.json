Zero is in the center of the x-axis and it goes to 12 percent on the left for males and on the right for females. Horizontal bars for each age range go out from the zero line at the center to the left in black for males and to the right in white for females. The first four bars from the bottom, from ages 0 to 19, are approximately the same size for males and females and go to approximately 6, 5, 4, and 3 percent respectively. The next bar for ages 20-24 shows 6 percent males and 4 percent females. The next bar for ages 25-29 shows 11 percent males and 5 percent females. The next bar for ages 30-35 shows 10 percent males and 4 percent females. The next bar for ages 35-39 shows 8 percent males and 3 percent females. The next bar for ages 40-44 shows 5 percent males and 2 percent females. The next bar for ages 45-49 shows 3 percent males and 1 percent females. The bars for females steadily decrease in size and remain smaller than the bars for males until there is no more bar for greater than 64 years old. The bars for males steadily decrease in size until greater than or equal to 80 years old, which is less than 1 percent.\" height=\"384\" src=\"/images/e1661929ff9b1805766d19c9bc4ba933.png\" width=\"360\"><br>\nThe sex ratio represented in the age-sex graph above for Country X is most likely the result of",
