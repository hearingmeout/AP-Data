Ball <em>X</em> initially moves at 10 meters per second, as shown in Figure I above. It then collides elastically with identical ball <em>Y</em>, which is initially at rest. After the collision, ball <em>X</em> moves at 6 meters per second along a path at 53° to its original direction, as shown in Figure II above. Which of the following diagrams best represents the motion of ball <em>Y</em> after the collision?</p>\n",
