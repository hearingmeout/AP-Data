The masses of the spheres and the lengths of the crossbars are indicated in the diagram. The body rotates about a vertical axis along the support post with constant angular speed 𝜔 . If the masses of the support post and the crossbars are negligible, what is the ratio of the angular momentum of the two upper spheres to that of the two lower spheres?</p>\n",
