    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a track that has a small horizontal portion on the left, then becomes decreasing to the right and concave up, and finally becomes a horizontal surface on the right. The horizontal line on the right is extended to the left by a dashed line when the track goes above the horizontal, and the left-most point on the track is 5 meters above this dashed line. The curved portion of the track is labeled mu equals 0, the flat portion on the right is labeled mu equals 0.2, and the point where the track switches from curved to flat is labeled P. There is a box sitting on the small horizontal section on the left of the track at the top of the curved portion. \" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/16fe4eb4f220f1428bb2a5d99f330fa1.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p>A block slides from rest with negligible friction down the track above, descending a vertical height of 5.0 m to point <em>P</em> at the bottom. It then slides on the horizontal surface. The coefficient of friction between the block and the horizontal surface is 0.20. How far does the block slide on the horizontal surface before it comes to rest?</p>",
