The pulley on the upper left corner goes up and to the left at approximately a 45 degree angle, and the pulley on the upper right corner goes up and to the right at approximately a 45 degree angle. A string starts vertically on the left below the pulley, goes over the left pulley, continues horizontally to the right pulley, goes over the right pulley, and is again vertical below this pulley. There is a 4 kilogram box on each end of the string. \" height=\"140\" src=\"/images/d9466019c1988bfa53431e36ead673fb.png\" width=\"325\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Two 4 kg blocks hang from a rope that passes over two frictionless pulleys, as shown in the figure above. What is the tension in the horizontal portion of the rope if the blocks are not moving and the rope and the two pulleys have negligible mass?</p>\n",
