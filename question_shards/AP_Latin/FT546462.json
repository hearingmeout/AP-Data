The fan is south of the raft and compass rose and from the fan are arrows depicting air flowing north towards the raft and directly into the sail on the raft. The sail on the raft is perpendicular to the direction of air flow. North of the raft is a vertical arrow labeled ,a, directed north, and to the right of the raft is a horizontal arrow labeled v subscript zero, directed east. The fan is large enough so that the air will always strike the sail of the raft as the raft moves.\" height=\"215\" src=\"/images/dee12dde95cc22de146a7d77b09c89bb.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n\n<p>The toy raft shown in the top view above is sliding due east on frictionless ice at constant speed <em>v</em><sub>0</sub> when a fan blows on its sail, producing a constant acceleration <strong>a </strong>directed to the north. Which of the following could indicate the path of the raft while the fan is blowing?</p>\n",
