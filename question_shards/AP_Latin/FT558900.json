The masses of the blocks are <em>M, 2M</em>, and <em>3M</em>, respectively. Block A is initially moving to the right along the same line at a speed <em>v</em>, as shown in the figure above. Blocks B and C are initially at rest. Block A collides with and sticks to block B. The two blocks then collide with and stick to block C. What is the speed of block C after the collisions? </p>",
