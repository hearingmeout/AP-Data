The horizontal axis is labeled x in units of m, and the numbers 0 point 0 5 and 0 point 1 0 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled F subscript x in units of N. A straight line begins at the origin and extends downward and to the right, reaching its lowest value at a point below the x axis value of point 0 point 0 5. The graph is then a straight line that extends upward and to the right, ending on the x axis at the point 0 point 1 0.\" src=\"/images/06923d7593c3323acb8d05dc55371ef7.png\"></p><p>The graph above shows a conservative force <em>F<sub>x</sub></em> as a function of position <em>x</em> acting on an object in a closed system. If this is the only force acting on the object, what happens to the potential energy of the system as the object moves from 0 m to 0.10 m? </p>",
