The horizontal axis is labeled “t, in seconds,” and the numbers 2.0 through 6.0, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “F, in Newtons,” and the numbers 0.0 through 6.0, in increments of 2, are indicated. The curve begins at the origin, is briefly concave up, extends upward and to the right, becomes concave down at about t = 2 s, reaches a maximum slightly to the right of the point with coordinates 3 comma 5, extends downward and to the right, and becomes concave up again at about t = 4 s. The curve levels off as it approaches the horizontal axis. Twelve points are indicated along the curve and listed as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Point 1 has the coordinates 1.75 comma 0.25. Point 2 has the coordinates 2.25 comma 1.8. Point 3 has the coordinates 2.65 comma 4.0. Point 4 has the coordinates 3.0 comma 5.1. Point 5 has the coordinates 3.45 comma 4.8. Point 6 has the coordinates 3.85 comma 3.7. Point 7 has the coordinates 4.15 comma 2.1. Point 8 has the coordinates 4.63 comma 1.0.
