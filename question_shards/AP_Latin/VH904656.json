The chair has a seat that can rotate with virtually no friction. Initially, the man sits in the position shown. The man begins to slowly spin, and then pulls his hands inward. Which of the following is a correct claim about the man’s motion as he pulls his hands inward and the correct justification for this claim?</p>\n",
