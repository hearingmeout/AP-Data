A key in the bottom left of the map is labeled “Population Density.” A gradient is shown where a darker shade represents high, and a lighter shade represents low. Regions in the northeastern United States, Central America, northern South America, western Europe, central Africa, and Asia are generally shaded darker than the areas surrounding each of those regions.\" height=\"313\" src=\"/images/c38123269e595eda4331312c259434b1.png\" width=\"485\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Source: NASA, Columbia University, Natural Earth GIS</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The map shows the number of people per unit of land.
