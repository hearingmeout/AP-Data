However, imported porcelain from China was very expensive. Crafters in Germany and England developed new methods of making porcelain using feldspar and bone rather than the kaolin that was used in China. This new porcelain was viewed as having similar quality to Chinese porcelain, and the new methods continued to be used in Europe.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">This example describes what type of diffusion?</p>\n",
