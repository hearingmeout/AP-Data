The horizontal axis is labeled Time, and the vertical axis is labeled Low at the bottom of the axis, and High at the top. The graph is divided into four vertical sections, labeled from left to right as Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 4. There are 3 lines in the graph. The line representing Birth Rate starts at a point on the vertical axis near the top, and across Stage 1 the line first increases and decreases slightly multiple times. In Stage 2, the line increases slightly and then moves horizontally to the right. In Stage 3 the line decreases steeply down and to the right and continues decreasing in Stage 4. In Stage 4, when slightly above the horizontal axis, the line fluctuates up and down slightly, and ends just above the horizontal axis. The line representing Death Rate starts at a point on the vertical axis slightly above the start of the Birth Rate line, and across Stage 1 the line first decreases and increases slightly, intersecting the Birth Rate line multiple times. In Stage 2, the line decreases steeply downward and to the right and continues decreasing in Stage 3. Partway through Stage 3, the line begins to decrease more gradually, and in Stage 4 it moves horizontally to the right. It intersects the Birth Rate line once partway through Stage 4, and continues horizontally until it fluctuates up and down a bit in Stage 4, and then evens out. The line representing Total Population starts on the vertical axis slightly above the horizontal axis, and in Stage 1 it moves horizontally to the right. In Stage 2 the line increases, moving upward and to the right, and intersects the Death Rate line at a point at the end of Stage 2 and beginning of Stage 3. In Stage 3 the line continues to increase upward and to the right, and intersects the Birth Rate line at a point about two thirds of the way up the vertical axis. In Stage 4, the line begins to increase more gradually at first, and moves horizontally about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis.\" height=\"358\" src=\"/images/dc97d4e4d058a84dda9242e0213c205e.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the diagram of the demographic transition model, which of the following correctly describes the expected population change over time?</p>\n",
