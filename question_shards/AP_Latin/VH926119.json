The left side represents Male population and the right side represents Female population. Population is measured along the horizontal axis from 0 to 3 million in increments of 0.6 million. The data represented by the pyramid are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The shape of the pyramid is symmetrical about the vertical axis. From ages 0 through 24, male and female population hovers around 1.2 million. From ages 25 through 40, male and female population increases gradually, and peaks at approximately 2.2 million for the 40 through 44 age group. From 45 on, both male and female population decrease gradually and evenly, ending at just above 0 for the 100 plus age group.\" height=\"460\" src=\"/images/436a49c484d7087d1100d0a130bad7f9.png\" width=\"650\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Source: United States Census Bureau</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following explains how data from the population pyramid for Spain would be useful for government policy makers?</p>\n",
