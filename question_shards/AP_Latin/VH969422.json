This the Constitution forbids. . . . The . . . goal asserted by petitioner is the attainment of a diverse student body. This clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education. . . . The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">According to the quote, what was the likely effect of the Court’s ruling in the <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Bakke</span> case?</p>\n",
