    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The spatial organization of agriculture has changed because of an increase in the number of farms as farmers join local commodity chains that regulate supply and demand for agricultural products and large profits can be realized.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The spatial organization of agriculture has remained stable, but farm productivity has increased through technological innovations that are available to farmers through membership in local commodity chains.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Commodity chains have led to changes in the spatial organization of agriculture from dispersed family farms to large corporate farms that produce, process, and distribute the products.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Farms are increasing in size, but there is little change in the spatial organization of agriculture because of the instability of regional cooperatives and associated commodity chains that cannot meet the demand for new products desired by consumers.</p>",
        "value": "i4"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Commodity chains have had no effect on the spatial organization of agriculture because they operate only in areas of grain farming; dairy and meat products spoil rapidly and markets are too far away for safe and rapid transportation of those products.</p>",
