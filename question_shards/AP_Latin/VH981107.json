Four points, labeled A through D, are shown along the path. The path initially curves upwards and to the right, reaches a peak, and then curves downwards and to the right at a distance approximately twice as long as the initial curve, and then curves upwards and to the right for the same distance. Point A is shown on the initial curve that moves upwards and to the right. Point B is shown after the first peak, at a point near the top of the downwards curve. Point C is located at a point near the bottom of the downwards curve. Point D is located near the top of the last curve that moves upwards and to the right. Each point has been associated with a vector. A vector with a long arrow, labeled F sub A, is located at point A pointing downwards and slightly to the left. A vector with a short arrow, labeled F sub B, is located at point B pointing slightly upwards and to the left. A vector with a medium length arrow, labeled F sub C, is located at point B pointing slightly upwards and horizontally to the right. A vector with a medium length arrow, labeled F sub D, is located at point D pointing downwards and slightly to the right.\" height=\"180\" src=\"/images/69a32ddf135ee7e0c487594565656f95.png\" width=\"350\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A particle of mass <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M\"><math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>M</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> moves from point <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A\"><math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> to point <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D \"><math alttext=\"D \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mi>D</mi></mstyle></math></span></span> along the path shown in the diagram.
