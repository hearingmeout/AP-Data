    "answer": "i1",
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Comparative advantage, because products can be made more efficiently in the southern United States and Mexico. Operating costs and wages are lower, and the manufactured products are easily transported to major United States markets.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Growth poles, because governments in southern United States cities and Mexico strive to stimulate economic development by providing a guaranteed market for all products manufactured at these locations.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Just-in-time delivery, because the United States population is shifting to the south and west, and the Mexican population is growing. It is critical to produce goods closer to the consumer base to reduce shipping times.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Complementarity, because the regional economy of the midwestern and northeastern United States is shifting to the service sector. There is little interest in maintaining manufacturing at these locations.</p>",
        "value": "i4"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Post-Fordist production, because traditional midwestern and northeastern manufacturing centers in the United States are unable to keep up with the technological changes of modern industry.</p>",
