The rock and the astronaut are at rest relative to a nearby spaceship. The mass of the rock is greater than the mass of the astronaut and the mass of the cord is negligible. Which of the following best describes and explains the behavior of the center of mass of the astronaut-cord-rock system relative the spaceship as the astronaut pulls on the cord?</p>\n",
