Each graph has a horizontal axis labeled Time with a tick mark near the end of the axis, a vertical axis labeled Net Torque, and origin labeled O. The Cylinder graph shows a line that starts on the vertical axis above the origin and moves downward and to the right and ends slightly above the tick mark near the end of the horizontal axis. The Sphere graph shows a curve that starts on the vertical axis below the origin and moves upward and to the right, steeply at first and then more gradually, and ends slightly below the tick mark near the end of the horizontal axis.\" src=\"/images/6de3f09bb9d55c9902779489ae6f3ecb.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The two graphs show the net torque exerted on two rotating objects, a cylinder, and a sphere, as a function of time. If both objects are initially rotating in the positive direction, taken to be counterclockwise, for which object does the angular momentum <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">decrease</span> in magnitude during the time interval shown? What reasoning supports the claim?</p>\n",
