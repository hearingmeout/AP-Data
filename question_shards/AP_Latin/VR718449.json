The rod has a nonuniform linear mass density such that its center of mass is not at its midpoint, and there is negligible friction between the rod and the surface. Two forces that are equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, are briefly exerted on the ends of the rod as indicated. While they are being exerted, the two forces result in an angular acceleration for the rod and may or may not result in a linear acceleration for the rod’s center of mass. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">linear</span> acceleration <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"a\"><math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>a</mi></math></span></span> of the center of mass is zero or nonzero, and provides reasoning for the nonzero <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">angular</span> acceleration of the rod?</p>\n",
