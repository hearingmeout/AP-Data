A spring is attached to a wall near the bottom of the ramp and is parallel to the ramp surface. The cart is released from rest, rolls down the ramp, compresses the spring, reverses direction, and is then launched back up the ramp by the spring. The cart returns to its initial position, and the motion repeats. Although the cart’s motion is periodic, it is not simple harmonic motion. Which of the following provides reasoning for the claim that the cart does not undergo simple harmonic motion?</p>\n",
