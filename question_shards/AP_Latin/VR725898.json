The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the value t sub 0 is indicated approximately a quarter of the way along the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Acceleration.” The wave begins at the origin and moves upward and to the right and goes through 1.5 cycles. The wave reaches t sub 0 after passing the first crest but before crossing the horizontal axis. The height of the wave at t sub 0 is approximately two thirds of the height of the crest.\" src=\"/images/0af5e18c48b1875b391c0c365dc37e3d.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An object undergoes simple harmonic motion.
