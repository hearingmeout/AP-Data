Inside the tunnel the gravitational force on the rock is proportional to its distance from the moon’s center, and the rock undergoes simple harmonic motion after being released from rest at the moon’s surface. The rock’s kinetic energy is <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"K sub C\"><math alttext=\"K sub C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>K</mi><mtext>C</mtext></msub></math></span></span> when it is passing through the center of the moon.
