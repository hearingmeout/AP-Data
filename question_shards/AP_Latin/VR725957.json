In System <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"H\"><math alttext=\"H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>H</mtext></math></span></span>, the arrangement is horizontal and the block moves with negligible friction on a horizontal surface. In System <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"V\"><math alttext=\"V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>V</mtext></math></span></span>, the arrangement is vertical. The blocks in both systems are set up to oscillate with the same amplitude in simple harmonic motion. Is the maximum energy stored in the spring the same for both systems? What reasoning can be used to support the claim?</p>\n",
