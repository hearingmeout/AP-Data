On the left y-axis is the use in liters per person per day from 0 to 400 in increments of 100. On the right y-axis is the price in centers per liter from 0 to 0.12 in increments of 0.04. Bars are used to represent water use, and dots connected by lines are used to represent the water price. The first country is the United States and its bar goes up to about 425 and its dot is at about 0.06. The second country is Canada and its bar goes up to about 350 and its dot is at about 0.03. The third country is the United Kingdom and its bar goes up to about 200 and its dot is at about 0.06. The fourth country is France and its bar goes up to about 150 and its dot is at about 0.10.
