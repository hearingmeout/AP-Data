There is no scale but it is split evenly into four sections: stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4 from left to right. On the y-axis is rate. A dashed line indicates the birth rate and a solid line indicates the death rate. In Phase 1, the birth and death rates are both constant. In Phase 2, the birth rate is still constant at 50 but the death rate decreases to nearly 0. In phase 3, the birth rate decreases to nearly 0 and the death rate stays constant at close to 0. In phase 4, the birth and death rates are both constant and close to 0. \" height=\"266\" src=\"/images/c78fe5691d8b9cb8aedde8167bcd2041.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n\n<p>During which stage of the demographic transition shown above does a population begin to experience an explosive increase in growth?</p>\n",
