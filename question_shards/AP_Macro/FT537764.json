    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure presents a horizontal bar graph titled Net Primary Productivity. The horizontal axis is labeled Average Net Primary Productivity in kilocalories per meter squared per year and has the numbers 0 through 9,600 indicated in increments of 800 from left to right. On the vertical axis are three categories, reading from top to bottom, Tropical rain forest, Temperate forest, and Northern coniferous forest. The approximate primary productivity values for each forest are as follows: Tropical rain forest, 9,000 kilocalories per meter squared per year. Temperate forest, 6,000 kilocalories per meter squared per year. Northern coniferous forest, 3,600 kilocalories per meter squared per year.\" src=\"/images/6c1a7b056a6895bc346340820db059f9.png\"></p><p>The terrestrial biomes shown in the diagram above vary in net primary productivity.
