    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure presents two bar graphs. The top graph is titled 2013 Meat Production and Consumption in Selected Regions. The horizontal axis has the following four categories, from left to right: North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The left vertical axis is labeled Meat Consumption in daily grams per capita, and has the numbers 0 through 350 indicated in increments of 50 from bottom to top. The right vertical axis is labeled Meat Production in millions of tons and has the numbers 0 through 140 indicated in increments of 20. The key indicates that for each category, the bar on the left represents meat consumption and the bar on the right represents meat production. The approximate data are as follows: North America: meat consumption, 325 daily grams per capita; meat production, 39 million tons. Europe: meat consumption, 210 daily grams per capita; meat production, 55 million tons. Asia: meat consumption, 80 daily grams per capita; meat production, 120 million tons. Africa: meat consumption, 50 daily grams per capita; meat production, 18 million tons.  The bottom graph is titled Projected Human Population in Selected Regions. The horizontal axis has the following four categories, from left to right: North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The vertical axis is labeled Population, in billions, and has the numbers 0 through 6 indicated in increments of 1 from bottom to top. The key indicates that for each category, the bar on the left represents the year 2013 and the bar on the right represents projections for the year 2050. The data are as follows: North America: 2013, 0.5 billion; 2050, 0.6 billion. Europe: 2013, 0.6 billion; 2050, 0.6 billion. Asia: 2013, 4.2 billion; 2050, 5.5 billion. Africa: 2013, 1.1 billion; 2050, 2.6 billion.\" src=\"/images/6e1e3a0cd930e590d566725b47398c9a.png\"></p><p>Which of the following statements is consistent with the graphs above?</p>",
