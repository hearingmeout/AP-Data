A curve labeled Short-run Aggregate Supply is plotted starting in the lower left and increasing and concave up. Two values Y sub 1 and Y sub 2 are labeled on the horizontal axis with Y sub 1 less than Y sub 2, and two values P sub 1 and P sub 2 are labeled on the vertical axis with P sub 1 less than P sub 2. A vertical line labeled Full-employment Output is plotted at the value Y sub 2, intersecting the short-run aggregate supply curve. A horizontal dashed line at P sub 2 ends at this intersection. Dashed reference lines from Y sub 1 and P sub 1 meet at a point that it on the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left of this intersection.\" height=\"284\" src=\"/images/8669c1ce2e6e94705336e4a29dffe517.png\" width=\"365\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the macroeconomic conditions of Wattsonia. Many economists estimate that the natural rate of unemployment is 6 percent. If this is true and the current rate of unemployment is 5.1 percent, in what range of real gross domestic product is the economy currently producing?</p>\n",
