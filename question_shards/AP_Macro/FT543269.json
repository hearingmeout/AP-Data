A downward-sloping line, from left to right, is labeled Aggregate Demand. An upward-sloping line, from left to right, is labeled Short-Run Aggregate Supply. One vertical line, running parallel to the vertical axis and ending where it intersects the horizontal axis, is labeled Long-Run Aggregate Supply. All three lines intersect at one single point. The intersection point is about one third to the right of the vertical axis and slightly less than halfway above the horizontal axis.
