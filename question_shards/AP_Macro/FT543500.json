One quantity appears on the horizontal axis, approximately one third to the right of the vertical axis, and is labeled Y sub f. There are three lines on the graph. A vertical line labeled Long-run Aggregate Supply, parenthesis L R A S close parenthesis, starts from the horizontal axis at the quantity Y sub f and moves up parallel to the vertical axis. One downward sloping line, from left to right, is labeled Aggregate Demand, parenthesis A D close parenthesis, and begins approximately halfway above the horizontal axis and slightly to the right of the vertical axis. The line moves down and to the right, intersects the upward sloping line labeled Short-run Aggregate Supply, parenthesis S R A S close parenthesis, then intersects the L R A S line, and ends before reaching the horizontal axis. The S R A S line begins approximately one fourth to the right of the vertical axis and slightly above the horizontal axis, moves up and to the right, intersects the A D line, continues on to intersect the L R A S line, and then ends slightly more than halfway up from the horizontal axis. \" src=\"/images/0d685a4dd7542b4eb7b2ef32e7d5e555.png\"></p><p>According to the graph above, which of the following statements about the economy is true?</p>",
