A downward sloping line, from left to right, is labeled A D. This line begins in the top left area of the graph and moves down and to the right. An upward sloping line, from left to right, is labeled S R A S. This line begins toward the left side of the graph, just above the horizontal axis, moves slightly up and to the right, crosses A D, and ends to the right of A D. A vertical line labeled L R A S begins at the top of the graph, intersects the other two lines to the left of their intersection, and ends on the horizontal axis. The lines intersect at three points, which are marked with dots.\" height=\"233\" src=\"/images/eda479b568607f70aa144d80ab6c8e7f.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n\n<p>In the graph above, AD denotes the aggregate demand curve, SRAS the short-run aggregate supply curve, and LRAS the long-run aggregate supply curve.
