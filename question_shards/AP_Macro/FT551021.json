    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"A graph titled, “World Fossil Fuel Consumption, 1950 to 2002” plots three curves for oil, coal, and natural gas. The vertical axis represents millions tons of oil equivalent and ranges from 0 to 4,000, in increments of 1,000. The horizontal axis represents the year and ranges from 1950 to 2010, in increments of 10. The curve for natural gas originates from the point 1950 comma 150, rises gradually to the point 2002 comma 2,000. The curve for oil originates from 1950 comma 500, rises up to the right to a point 1972 comma 2,800, bends down and further rises to the point 1980 comma 3,100, further falls down to the point 1985 comma 2,700, and rises to the maximum point 2000 comma 3,500. The curve for coal originates from the point 1950 comma 1,100, rises and decreases gradually, intersects the oil curve at 1963 comma 1,500, and further rises to the point 2002 comma 2,100.
