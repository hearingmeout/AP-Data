The vertical axis is labeled “Percent Surviving,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 25, are indicated. Three lines represent three different years; 1900, 1940, and 1980.The line labeled “1900” begins near point 0 comma 100 and curves slightly downward and to the right. At approximately point 60 comma 50, the line begins to move steeply downward and to the right, ending near point 95 comma 0. The line labeled “1940” begins near point 0 comma 100 and curves slightly downward and to the right but remains above the 1900 line. At approximately point 60 comma 80, the line begins to move steeply downward and to the right, continuing to remain above the 1900 line, and ending near point 95 comma 0 .The line labeled “1980” begins near point 0 comma 100 and curves slightly downward and to the right but remains above the 1940 line.
