An arrow is drawn upward from a volcano, which indicates volcanic action, directly into atmospheric nitrogen. Two arrows are drawn from atmospheric nitrogen, one is drawn to lightning, and the other is drawn to nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soil and root from a plant. From both of these, an arrows are drawn to soil nitrate. There are two arrows branching out from soil nitrate. One arrow is drawn from soil nitrate to denitrifying bacteria from a pond, which has an arrow drawn back into atmospheric nitrogen. The other arrow extends from soil nitrate into a smaller cycle, as follows: the arrow is drawn from soil nitrate to nitrate taken up by plant roots at a tree, which has an arrow drawn to plant and animal proteins, which has an arrow drawn to dead organisms and feces, which has an arrow drawn to nitrifying bacteria, and finally has an arrow is drawn from nitrifying bacteria back into soil nitrate.\" height=\"324\" src=\"/images/4129465c6bc03d75121d4099bebb5468.png\" width=\"527\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following pathways indicate how nitrogen is added to the largest nitrogen reservoir?</p>\n",
