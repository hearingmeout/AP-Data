The vertical axis is labeled Carbon-Equivalent Footprint, in kilograms of C O 2 e per kilogram of product, and the numbers 0 through 70, in increments of 10, are indicated. The data are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Grass-fed Beef, 58 kilograms; Grass-fed and Feedlot Beef, 38 kilograms; Feedlot Beef, 25 kilograms; Seafood, fisheries, 13 kilograms; Pork, 7 kilograms; Seafood, aquaculture, 7 kilograms; Poultry, 5 kilograms; Beans and Soybeans, 2 kilograms.\" height=\"442\" src=\"/images/a995d09689efcd6a0cd849c9c0f11b3c.png\" width=\"500\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Humans consume a variety of protein products, each with a different carbon footprint based on a variety of factors.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following claims is best supported by the data in the graph?</p>\n",
