The horizontal axis is labeled “Real G D P,” and the value Y sub F is indicated about one third of the way along the axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Level.” The three curves on the graph are labeled L R A S, S R A S, and A D. Curve L R A S begins on the horizontal axis at Y sub F and moves vertically upward. Curve S R A S begins slightly above the horizontal axis and to the left of curve L R A S, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. Curve S R A S intersects curve L R A S about one fifth of the way up the vertical axis, and ends far to the right of Y sub F and about two thirds of the way up the vertical axis. Curve A D begins near the top of the graph, just to the right of the vertical axis, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects curve L R A S about halfway up the vertical axis, and then intersects curve S R A S at a point labeled H, which is about halfway along the horizontal axis and one third of the way up the vertical axis.
