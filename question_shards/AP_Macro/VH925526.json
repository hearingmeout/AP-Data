Line A D 1 begins at about two thirds up the vertical axis, moves downward and to the right, and ends halfway on the horizontal axis. A point, labeled X, is located near the beginning of Line A D 1. Line A D 2 begins slightly near the top of the vertical axis, and moves downward and to the right and ends about three quarters above the horizontal axis. A point, labeled Y, is shown halfway down line A D 2, and another point, labeled Z, is located approximately two thirds down line A D 2 to the right of point Y. Line A D 3 begins one quarter of the way across the horizontal axis and at the top of the vertical axis, and moves downward and to the right. It ends near the rightmost point on the horizontal axis.
