The horizontal axis is labeled “Real G D P,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Price Level.” The three curves on the graph are labeled S R A S, A D sub 1, and A D sub 2. The S R A S curve begins just above and just to the right of the origin, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It ends about two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis, and about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis. The A D sub 1 curve begins just to the right of the vertical axis, at a height just below where the S R A S curve ends, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The A D sub 1 curve intersects the S R A S curve, and ends to the right of where the S R A S curve ends, just above the horizontal axis. The A D sub 2 curve begins above and to the right of where the A D sub 1 curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line, parallel to the A D sub 1 curve. The A D sub 2 curve intersects the S R A S curve, and ends above and to the right of where the A D sub 1 curve ends. An arrow is drawn on the graph, below the S R A S curve, and points horizontally to the right, from the A D sub 1 curve to the A D sub 2 curve.\" src=\"/images/87cec1c52d2953617e7db253fdb40bc6.svg\"></div>\n</div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following will shift the aggregate demand curve in the direction shown in the diagram above?</p>\n",
