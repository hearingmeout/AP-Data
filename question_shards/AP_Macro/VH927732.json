The horizontal axis is labeled Real G D P, and the vertical axis is labeled Price Level. The first curve is labeled A D, and begins just to the right of the vertical axis, high above the horizontal axis. It moves downward and to the right until it ends just above the horizontal axis, far to the right of the vertical axis. The second curve is labeled S R A S, and begins just to the right of the vertical axis, below the A D curve. It moves upward and to the right, intersects the A D curve, and ends high above, far to the right of the vertical axis. The third curve is labeled L R A S. It is a straight vertical line that begins at the horizontal axis and passes through the point where the A D and S R A S curves intersect.\" height=\"273\" src=\"/images/ad0b21c7b0965eb0e03ebc3c15c71355.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Country X’s economic situation is depicted by the graph above.
