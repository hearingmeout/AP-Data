The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the years 1970 through 2020, in increments of 5 years, are indicated. Two vertical axes are shown. The vertical axis on the left is labeled Trillions of Vehicle Miles Traveled, and the numbers 0 through 5.0, in increments of 0.5, are indicated. The vertical axis on the right is labeled Volatile organic compounds, in grams per mile, and the numbers 0 through 14, in increments of 2, are indicated. A key shows that two categories of data are represented: annual vehicle miles traveled and V O Cs emissions. The data shown on the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Year 1970, 1.0 trillion miles traveled; 13 grams of V O Cs. Year, 1975, 1.2 trillion miles traveled; 3.7 grams of V O Cs. Year 1980, 1.5 trillion miles traveled; 7 grams of V O Cs. Year 1985, 1.7 trillion miles traveled; 5 grams of V O Cs. Year 1990, 2.0 trillion miles traveled; 4 grams of V O Cs. Year 1995, 2.2 trillion miles traveled; 3 grams of V O Cs. Year 2000, 2.5 trillion miles traveled; 2 grams of V O Cs. Year 2005, 2.6 trillion miles traveled; 1 gram of V O Cs. Year 2010, 3.0 trillion miles traveled; 0.5 gram of V O Cs.
