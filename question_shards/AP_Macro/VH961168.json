There are four stages of the rock cycle labeled letters A through D on the diagram, as follows: A, Magma; B, Igneous Rock; C, Sedimentary Rock; D, Metamorphic Rock. In the diagram, there are events listed including: 1. cooling and crystallization, 2. melting, 3. pressure and heat, 4. heat and pressure, 5. weathering, erosion, and deposition, and 6. compaction and cementation. An arrow labeled Cooling and Crystallization points from Magma, which is letter A, to Igneous Rock, which is letter B. An arrow labeled Melting points from Igneous Rock, which is letter B, to Magma, which is letter A. An arrow labeled Pressure and Heat points from Igneous Rock, which is letter B, to Metamorphic Rock, which is letter D. An arrow labeled Weathering, Erosion, and Deposition points from Igneous Rock, which is letter B, to Sediment, which has not been labeled with a letter. An arrow labeled Compaction and Cementation points from Sediment to Sedimentary Rock, which is letter C.&nbsp; An arrow labeled Weathering, Erosion, and Deposition points from Sedimentary Rock, which is letter C, to Sediment.
