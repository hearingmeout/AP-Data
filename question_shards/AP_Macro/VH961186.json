The diagram contains structures labeled with the letters A, B, C, and D. On the left, there is a structure labeled containment building. Inside the containment building, there is a structure labeled C. There are arrows moving from the containment building in structures through steam lines to a structure labeled turbine. The turbine connects to a structure labeled B. Structure B is connected to a transformer, which is connected to a switchyard. From the turbine, arrows are shown to a structure labeled D. Arrows move through additional steam lines to a structure labeled A. From A, arrows are in lines containing cooling water looping back to structure D. A reservoir of water is shown below structure A with arrows shown from the reservoir to structure A.\" height=\"353\" src=\"/images/01d0533342fef87cc2f5bebdf08777a7.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">At which of the following locations in the nuclear power plant would an accident most likely result in the release of fission products?</p>\n",
