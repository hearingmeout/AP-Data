The horizontal axis contains four categories: blown cellulose, mineral fiber batt, expanded polystyrene, and rigid foam. The vertical axes contains two measures. The left vertical axis is labeled Air Pollution Index Continuation, per square foot, and the numbers 0 through 0.035, in increments of 0.005, are indicated. The right vertical axis is labeled Thermal Resistance, in resistance for 6 inches, and the numbers 0 through 45, in increments of 5, are indicated. A key shows that two categories of data are represented in the graph: resistance, in 6 inches, and air pollution index. The data shown in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Blown cellulose: thermal resistance, 7; air pollution index, 0.010. Mineral fiber batt: thermal resistance, 8; air pollution index, 0.007. Expanded polystyrene: thermal resistance, 24; air pollution index, 0.019. Rigid foam: thermal resistance, 39; air pollution index, 0.022.\" height=\"541\" src=\"/images/7c13edd9e2e104046e21350a9f3631b2.png\" width=\"500\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the data in the graph, which of the following insulation options is ineffective at insulating a home and greatly contributes to indoor air pollution?</p>\n",
