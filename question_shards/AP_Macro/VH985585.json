The first row of the flow chart shows increased flooding and storms, changes in precipitation, and increased duration of the warm season resulting in changes in median temperature. The first row of information flows into the second row, which shows expanded geographical range and changes in vector behaviors. The second row of information flows into the third row, which shows increased cases of vector-born diseases, such as Lyme Disease, Malaria, the Zika Virus, and the West Nile Virus.\" height=\"621\" src=\"/images/01fb9f84c4e771794218041ddcb112fd.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the information in the diagram, which of the following best supports the claim that a change in the duration of warm seasons would result in a higher prevalence of vector-borne diseases?</p>\n",
