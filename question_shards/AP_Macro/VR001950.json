The dolphins in the study will be of similar age and living in the same habitat. Which of the following best identifies a testable hypothesis for the study?</p>\n",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Different species of dolphins will have different levels of mercury in their fatty tissues depending on the species’ ability to absorb and excrete mercury.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dolphins will have the highest levels of mercury in their fatty tissues when they are exposed to the highest concentration of mercury.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dolphin species that are not exposed to mercury in the water will still have trace levels of mercury in their muscle tissues from exposure through air.</p>",
