The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Clinkers,” and the numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price, in dollars,” and the numbers 5 through 25, in increments of 5, are indicated. The curves in the graph are labeled Demand and Supply. The Demand curve begins at the point with approximate coordinates 1 comma 25, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma 20, 3 comma 15, and 4 comma 10, and it ends at the point with approximate coordinates 5 comma 5. The Supply curve begins at the point with approximate coordinates 1 comma 5, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the point with coordinates 2 comma 10, intersects the Demand curve at the point with coordinates 3 comma 15, and passes through the point with coordinates 4 comma 20.
