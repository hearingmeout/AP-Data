Each axis is labeled from 0 to 100 in increments of 20 with dashed reference lines drawn at each labeled value.

Two curves are plotted below this line that both start at the origin, end at the point 100 percent and 100 percent, and are increasing and concave up everywhere. The upper curve is labeled country X and the curve passes through the points 40 percent of households and 20 percent of income, and 80 percent of households and 60 percent of income. The lower curve is labeled country Y and the curve passes through the points 60 percent of households and 20 percent of income, and 80 percent of households and 40 percent of income.\" height=\"279\" src=\"/images/80196d42c2d4028f6e7d5318cce1772d.jpg\" width=\"393\"></p>\n\n<p>Based on the information in the Lorenz curve above, which of the following is true?</p>\n",
