A curve that is decreasing and concave down starts near the top of the vertical axis and ends near the right of the horizontal axis. Five points A through E are labeled on the graph. Points A, B, and C are on the curve with A just to the right of the vertical axis, B about a third of the way along the curve clockwise from the vertical axis, and C at the intersection with the horizontal axis.
