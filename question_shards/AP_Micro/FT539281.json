The first curve is labeled average total cost, which is decreasing on the left then reaches a minimum near the center of the graph and increases on the right. The second curve is labeled average variable cost, which looks very similar to the average total cost curve but sits entirely underneath it. The third curve is labeled marginal cost, which is increasing and concave up, starting in the lower left of the graph and intersecting first the average variable cost curve then the average total cost curve near their minimums. Three values, 5, 6, and 10 dollars, are labeled on the vertical axis, and the value 20 is labeled on the horizontal axis, all with dashed reference lines drawn from them. The vertical line at 20 intersects the horizontal line at 5 dollars on the average variable cost curve, the horizontal line at 6 dollars on the average total cost curve, and the horizontal line at 10 dollars on the marginal cost curve.\" height=\"264\" src=\"/images/cb0ebda6a5431b8629c01fbdd1c67de4.jpg\" width=\"433\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the cost curves for a competitive firm that produces 20 units of output.
