    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"A graph in the first quadrant is shown with number of teenage workers on the horizontal axis and wage rate on the vertical axis. Two lines are plotted. One is increasing from left to right and is labeled supply, and the other is decreasing from left to right and is labeled demand. The lines cross near the center of the graph, and they are nearly perpendicular. Two values W sub 1 and W sub 2 are labeled on the vertical axis above the crossing of the two plotted lines. Horizontal dashed reference lines are drawn from each value across the demand line, ending on the supply line.\" src=\"/images/b15b559fc18c16db46259933e9e468fb.jpg\"></p><p>The graph above illustrates the labor market for teenage workers.
