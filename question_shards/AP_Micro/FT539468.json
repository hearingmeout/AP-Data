Five quantities appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled, from left to right Q sub one, Q sub 2, Q sub 3, Q sub 4, and Q sub 5. One point appears on the vertical axis, just above the origin, and is labeled G.  Two lines appear on the graph. A straight line labeled T R begins at the origin and moves steadily up and to the right, and ends near the top of the graph, to the right of Q sub 5. A curve labeled T C starts from point G at the vertical axis , curves up and to the right, passes through the coordinates for the quantity Q sub one, begins to level as it intersects the T R line at a quantity Q sub 2, and increases in distance from the T R line as it moves up until it reaches the coordinate for the quantity Q sub 3, then decreases in distance from the T R line as it continues up and to the right, intersects the T R line at a quantity for Q sub 4, and ends above the T R line at a quantity of Q sub 5.\" height=\"222\" src=\"/images/21b5e85767a6fd76ef1e15e4be4592e3.JPG\" width=\"273\"></p>\n\n<p>At which level of output is profit maximized?</p>\n",
