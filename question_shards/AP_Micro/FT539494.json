    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shoes a graph for a monopsonistic labor market with a horizontal axis labeled Number of Workers and a vertical axis labeled Wage. Two quantities appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled, from left to right, L sub one and L sub 2. Four prices appear on the vertical axis and are labeled, from bottom to top, W sub one, W sub 2, W sub 3, and W sub 4. There are two upward sloping lines and one downward sloping line on the graph. The leftmost upward sloping line is labeled Marginal Factor Cost, and begins to the right of the vertical axis and below a wage of W sub one, moves up and to the right, intersects the downward sloping line at L sub one and W sub 3, continues on, passing through the coordinates for L sub 2 and W sub 4. The rightmost upward sloping line is labeled Supply, and begins slightly below the start of the Marginal Factor Cost line, moves up and to the right, increasing in distance from the Marginal Factor Cost line as it moves up, and intersects the downward sloping line at L sub 2 and W sub 2, continues on, and ends to the right of and below the Marginal Factor Cost line. The downward sloping line is labeled Marginal Revenue Product, and begins to the right of the vertical axis and above wage W sub 4, moves down and to the right, intersects the marginal Factor Cost line at L sub one and W sub 3, then intersects the Supply line at L sub 2 and W sub 2, and continues on. The upward and downward sloping lines do not cross the horizontal or vertical axis. \" src=\"/images/3db65cef781d271ee6b0cbf8bd6088fc.jpg\"></p><p>In the monopsonistic labor market shown in the diagram above, which of the following indicates the number of workers the firm will hire and the wage rate it will pay?</p>",
