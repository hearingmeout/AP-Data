There are 5 points on the horizontal axis labeled, from left to right, L 1, L 2, L 3, L 4, and L 5. There are 2 curves on the graph. One curve is labeled M P and begins to the left of L 1 above the horizontal axis, curves up to a maximum above L 2, and then curves down to cross the horizontal axis at L 5. The second curve is labeled A P and begins below the M P curve. The A P curve curves gently up and stays below the M P curve as it passes L 1 and L 2 until it reaches a maximum at L 3, and then curves gently down above the M P curve as it passes L 4 and L 5. The 2 curves intersect at a point with coordinate L 3. \" src=\"/images/5d334ee3a00f3665ce22e882dbc58e11.jpg\"></p><p>The graph above shows the marginal product (MP) and the average product (AP) of labor for a firm that uses labor as the only variable input and hires its labor in a perfectly competitive market.
