There are 4 points on the horizontal axis labeled, from left to right, Q 1, Q 2, Q 3, and Q 4. There are 3 points on the vertical axis labeled, from bottom to top, W 1, W 2, and W 3. There are 3 solid straight lines on the graph. One solid straight line labeled M R P begins on the vertical axis above W 3 and moves down and to the right, ending above the horizontal axis beyond Q 4. The second solid straight line is labeled M F C and begins on the vertical axis below W 1 and moves up and to the right, crosses M R P, and ends above the horizontal axis between Q 3 and Q 4. Line M F C intersects line M R P at a point with coordinates Q 3 and W 3. The third solid straight line labeled S begins at the same point as M F C on the vertical axis and moves less steeply up and to the right, staying below M F C, crosses M R P, and ends above the horizontal axis beyond Q 4. Line S intersects line M R P at a point with coordinates Q 4 and W 2. There are 3 other unlabeled points on the graph. The first point lies on line M F C with coordinates Q 1 and W 1. The second point lies on line M F C with coordinates Q 2 and W 2.
