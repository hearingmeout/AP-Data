The values 5, 10, 15, and 20 dollars are labeled on the vertical axis, and the values 200 and 250 are labeled on the horizontal axis, and all labeled values have dashed reference lines drawn. Two lines are plotted starting from one point on the vertical axis above 20 dollars, with the upper line labeled demand and the lower line labeled marginal revenue, which reaches the horizontal axis at quantity 250. There are also two curves plotted, both of which are concave up everywhere and start by decreasing, then reach a minimum and increase to the right. The first curve, labeled average total cost, has its minimum near the center of the graph between the demand and marginal revenue lines. The second curve, labeled marginal cost, has its minimum in the lower left of the graph below the marginal revenue line and intersects the marginal revenue line at quantity 200 and price 5 dollars, then intersects the average total cost curve at its minimum, then intersects the demand line at quantity 250 and 15 dollars. The reference lines also indicate that the point at quantity 200 and 20 dollars is on the demand line and the point at quantity 200 and 10 dollars is on the average total cost curve.\" height=\"245\" src=\"/images/87a2d189d1e4347997a801cceff5bea4.jpg\" width=\"386\">\n<p>Which of the following statements about the firm whose cost and revenue curves are shown above is correct?</p>",
