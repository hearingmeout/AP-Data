Point P is labeled near the middle of the price axis and point Q is labeled near the left of the quantity axis. Two straight lines are plotted that start at the same point on the vertical axis above point P and decrease to the right, with the upper line labeled demand and the lower line labeled marginal revenue. Three curves are also plotted that are concave up everywhere and start decreasing on the left, reach a minimum, and then increase to the right. The first curve is labeled Average Total Cost, and it has its minimum near the middle of the graph above the demand line. The second curve is labeled Average Variable Cost and it sits completely below the Average Total Cost curve, with its minimum near its intersection the demand line, below price P and above quantity Q. The third curve is labeled Marginal Cost. Its minimum is in the lower left of the graph, to the left of Q and below P. It crosses both lines as it increases to the right. It also crosses the Average Total Cost and Average Variable Cost curves near their minimums. Horizontal and vertical dashed reference lines are drawn at values P and Q respectively, ending on the demand line. The vertical reference line passes through the intersection of the marginal revenue line and the marginal cost curve. \" height=\"270\" src=\"/images/51f9c4cb0b52419ca2bb6d82eccd3cab.jpg\" width=\"451\"></p>\n\n<p>The profit-maximizing firm depicted in the graph above should</p>\n",
