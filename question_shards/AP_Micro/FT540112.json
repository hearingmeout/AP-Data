Values Q 1, Q 2, Q 3, and Q 4 are labeled on the horizontal axis, with Q 1 and Q 2 near the origin and Q 3 and Q 4 further apart and near the center of the axis. A straight, increasing line is drawn from the origin through the center of the graph, and this line is labeled total revenue. A curve labeled total cost is also drawn that starts on the vertical axis just above the origin where it is increasing and concave down. A dashed vertical line is drawn from Q 1 on the horizontal axis to this part of the curve. The curve then becomes nearly horizontal as it crosses the total revenue line for the first time, and a dashed vertical line is drawn from Q 2 on the horizontal axis to this intersection. The curve, which is now below the total revenue line, then becomes increasing and concave up, and a vertical dashed line is drawn from Q 3 on the horizontal axis through the total cost line and ending on the total revenue line. The total cost line then crosses the total revenue line again, and a vertical dashed line is drawn from Q 4 on the horizontal axis to this intersection. \" height=\"229\" src=\"/images/4b35e9ad38b32fbf7a52ac5775dde6a9.jpg\" width=\"298\">\n<p>The graph above shows the total revenue and total cost curves for a firm in which type of market structure and what is the profit-maximizing quantity?</p>",
