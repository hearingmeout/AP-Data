One is increasing from left to right and is labeled supply, and the other is decreasing from left to right and is labeled demand. The lines cross near the center of the graph, and they are nearly perpendicular. Two values P sub 1 and P sub 2 with P sub 1 less than P sub 2 are labeled on the vertical axis. A horizontal reference line from P sub 1 meets the lines at their intersection, and a horizontal reference line from P sub 2 intersects first the demand line and then the supply line above their intersection.\" src=\"/images/884ceca4bb3cddd140e3ecbb312e42a1.png\"></p><p>The diagram above shows the demand and supply curves for a normal good.
