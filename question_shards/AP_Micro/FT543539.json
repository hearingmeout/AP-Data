    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"A graph in the first quadrant is shown with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. Three values P sub 1, P sub 2, and P sub 3 are labeled on the vertical axis from bottom to top, and values Q sub 1 and Q sub 2 are labeled on the horizontal axis from left to right. Dashed reference lines are drawn from each labeled value. Two parallel lines are plotted starting on the vertical axis, the top line labeled supply after tax beginning at P sub 1 and the bottom line labeled supply before tax beginning below P sub 1. A double ended arrow labeled tax points between the two ines. A third line labeled demand starts on the vertical axis above P sub 3 and decreases, crossing the supple after tax line at Q sub 1 and P sub 3 and crossing the supply before tax line at Q sub 2 and P sub 2. The point at Q sub 1 and P sub 1 lies on the supply before tax line to the left of the intersection. Eight regions A through H are labeled on the graph. Triangular region A is bounded by the vertical axis above P sub 3 on the top, the horizontal line at P sub 3 on the bottom, and the demand line on the right. Trapezoidal region B is bounded by the vertical axis from P sub 2 to P sub 3 on the left. The horizontal line at P sub 3 on the top, the horizontal P sub 2 on the bottom and the supply after tax line on the right. Triangular region C is bounded by the vertical axis above the line at P sub 3 on the top and P sub 2 on the bottom and the supply after tax line to the light. Triangular region D is bounded by the vertical axis above the P sub 2 line and to the right of the supply after tax line. The triangular region E is bounded by the vertical axis before the P sub 2 line and below the demand line. Trapezoidal region F is bounded by the vertical axis with the horizontal line at P sub 2  on top and the horizontal line at P sub 1 on the bottom. Triangular region G is bounded by the vertical axis by the horizontal line at P sub 1 on top and the supply after tax line to the right. Triangular region H is bounded by the vertical axis with the horizontal line at P sub 2 at the top and the horizontal line at P sub 1 at the bottom.\" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/9d92e932f95eac1cabee96a882ad942c.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p>The graph above shows the market for good X The letters in the graph denote the enclosed areas If the government imposes an excise tax of t dollars on each unit of good X, which of the following represents the consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss after the imposition of the tax?</p>",
