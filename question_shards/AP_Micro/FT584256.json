Two quantities appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled, from left to right, Q sub 1 and Q sub 2. Three prices appear on the vertical axis and are labeled from bottom to top, P sub 1, P sub 2, and P sub 3.There is a downward sloping line labeled Demand on the graph. The Demand line intersects the vertical axis at P sub 3 and moves down and to the right as the quantity increases. Two points are labeled on the Demand line, from left to right, a point labeled B with coordinates Q sub 1 and P sub 2 and a point labeled C with coordinates Q sub 2 and P sub 1 and the line ends before reaching the horizontal axis. One point below the line is labeled D and has coordinates Q sub 1 and P sub 1.\" height=\"234\" src=\"/images/77d20e08a60513332199c58744b0a113.jpg\" width=\"265\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above shows the demand curve for a good.
