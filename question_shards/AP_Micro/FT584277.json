    "prompt": "<p style=\"margin-left: 240px;\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a graph with the cost curves for a perfectly competitive firm. The horizontal axis of the graph is labeled Quantity, and the vertical axis of the graph is labeled Price. The intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis is labeled zero. Four quantities appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled, from left to right, Q sub 1, Q sub 2, Q  sub 3, and Q sub 4. Three prices appear on the vertical axis, and are labeled from bottom to top, P sub 1, P sub 2, and P sub 3. In the graph there are three cost curves labeled, Marginal Cost, Average Total Cost, and Average Variable Cost. The Marginal Cost curve intersects with each of the other curves and the Average Total Cost curve is always above the Average Variable Cost curve. Starting from the lower left of the graph,  the Marginal Cost curve begins at point R with a coordinate on the Quantity axis that is to the left of Q sub 1 and is aligned with P sub 1 on the vertical axis. It curves steeply down and at a point labeled S, with coordinate Q sub 1 and below P sub 1 on the vertical axis, curves away from the horizontal axis and moves up and to the right. (Point S is the minimum point of the Marginal Cost curve.) When the Marginal Cost curve moves up and to the right, it intersects the other 2 cost curves at their minimum points; this line intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at a point labeled T and the Average Total Cost curve at a point labeled U and continues on through point V with coordinates Q sub 4 and P sub 3. Starting above and slightly to the right of point R, the starting point of the Marginal Cost curve, on the graph, the Average Variable Cost curve begins at a point with a coordinate on the Quantity axis that is just to the left of Q sub 1 and aligns with P sub 3 on the vertical axis. The curve moves gently down and to the right to a minimum point of the curve labeled T which is also the point of intersection with the Marginal cost curve. Point T has coordinates Q sub 2, P sub 1 and at that point the Average Variable Cost graph curves away from the horizontal axis and moves up to the right moving past Q sub 4 and P sub 3. Starting above and slightly to the right of the starting point of the Average Variable Cost curve on the graph, the Average Total Cost curve begins at a point with a coordinate on the Quantity axis that is just to the right of Q sub 1 and is slightly above P sub 3 on the vertical axis. The curve moves gently down and to the right to a minimum point of the curve labeled U which is also the point of intersection with the Marginal cost curve. Point U has coordinates Q sub 3, P sub 2 and at that point the Average Total Cost graph curves away from the horizontal axis and moves gently up to the right moving past Q sub 4 and P sub 3.\" height=\"277\" src=\"/images/cf25face008628f9b0764edd2d9102c7.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following segments of the marginal cost curve lies entirely on the firm’s short-run supply curve?</p>\n",
