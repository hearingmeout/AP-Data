The intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis is labeled zero. Four quantities appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled from left to right, Q sub 1, Q sub 2, Q sub 3, and Q sub 4. Three prices appear on the vertical axis and are labeled from bottom to top P sub 1, P sub 2, and P sub 3. The graph has 2 lines that appear to be perpendicular to each other. There is a line sloping down and to the right labeled Demand. There is a line sloping up and to the right labeled Supply. The 2 lines intersect at the coordinates Q sub 3 and P sub 2. The downward-sloping line labeled Demand starts to the left of Q sub 1 and above P sub 3, passes through the coordinates Q sub 1 and P sub 3, then intersects the Supply line at coordinates Q sub 3, P sub 2, passes through the coordinates Q sub 4, P sub 1 and ends to the left of Q sub 5 and below P sub 1. The upward-sloping line labeled Supply starts just to the right of Q sub 1 and below P sub 1, passes through the coordinates Q sub 2 and P sub 1, intersects with the Demand line at coordinates Q sub 3 and P sub 2, passes through the coordinates Q sub 5 and P sub 3 and continues on.\" src=\"/images/9b34cbd2eb734edcc4e8a9985e8a7666.png\"></p><p>If the market depicted in the diagram above is initially in equilibrium, which of the following will result from the government’s setting a price ceiling at P<sub>3</sub>?</p>",
