One Price appears on approximately halfway up the vertical axis and is labeled $2,000. There is one vertical line and one downward-sloping line on the graph.   The vertical line is labeled Supply and starts near the top of the graph, and approximately one third of the way to the right of the vertical axis, and ends at the horizontal axis.   The downward-sloping line is labeled Demand. The line starts to the right of the vertical axis, above the price of $2,000. The line moves downward and to the right, passes through the Supply line at the coordinate for $2,000, and ends before reaching the horizontal axis. \" height=\"238\" src=\"/images/ce0c3fdbe71338ac774ca6fc768c26a5.png\" width=\"315\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above depicts demand and supply curves in a city’s rental housing market.
