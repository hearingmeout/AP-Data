The vertical axis is labeled Price comma Cost. A curve labeled M C begins slightly to the right and near the bottom of the vertical axis and moves up and to the right, gradually at first and then more steeply, until it ends in the upper right hand part of the graph. A curve labeled A T C begins slightly to the right and about half way up the vertical axis and moves down and to the right at first, until it reaches a minimum point where it intersects with the M C curve. It then rises and ends below the M C curve. Two lines, labeled M R and D, begin at the same point near the top of the vertical axis. Both lines slope down and to the right. The M R line is twice as steep as the D line. The M R curve passes to the left of the intersection of the M C and A T C curves. The D curve passes to the right of the intersection of the M C and A T C curves. The M R curve intersects the A T C curve first, and then intersects the M C curve. The D curve intersects the M C curve first, and then intersects the A T C curve. Both the M R and D curves end when they reach the horizontal axis. The D curve ends to the right of where the M R curve ends on the horizontal axis.\" height=\"263\" src=\"/images/25e5c7acc7b2e2f1ebaea13c1e420b83.png\" width=\"300\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the information in the above graph describing a monopolistically competitive firm, which of the following is true?</p>\n",
