The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the values Q sub 1 through Q sub 5 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Cost.” The L R A T C curve begins on the vertical axis well above the origin, moves downward and to the right to reach a minimum slightly above the vertical axis at quantity Q sub 3, and then moves upward and to the right and ends high above the horizontal axis to the right of Q sub 5. The height of the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 1 is equal to its height at quantity Q sub 5. The height of the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 2 is equal to its height at quantity Q sub 4. Each of the 5 S R A T C curves is a parabola that opens upward and intersects the L R A T C curve at one point. Curve S R A T C sub 1 intersects the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 1, which lies to the left of the vertex of parabola S R A T C sub 1. Curve S R A T C sub 2 intersects the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 2, which lies slightly to the left of the vertex of parabola S R A T C sub 2. Curve S R A T C sub 3 intersects the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 3, which is also the vertex of parabola S R A T C sub 3. Curve S R A T C sub 4 intersects the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 4, which lies slightly to the right of the vertex of parabola S R A T C sub 4. Curve S R A T C sub 5 intersects the L R A T C curve at quantity Q sub 5, which lies to the right of the vertex of parabola S R A T C sub 5.\" height=\"217\" src=\"/images/1fe236ffc413dec61930fbe3a66b1f8c.svg\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph provided shows five different short-run average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"S R A T C\"><math alttext=\"S R A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>SRATC</mtext></math></span></span>) curves of a firm and its long-run average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"L R A T C\"><math alttext=\"L R A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>LRATC</mtext></math></span></span>) curve.
