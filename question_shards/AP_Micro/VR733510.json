The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the value Q asterisk is indicated near the middle. The vertical axis is labeled “Price.” The four curves are labeled M R, A V C, A T C, and M C. The M R curve begins on the vertical axis near the middle, moves horizontally to the right in a straight line, and ends above the end of the horizontal axis. The A V C curve begins slightly to the right of the vertical axis and above the M R curve, moves downward and to the right, intersects the M R curve, and continues downward and to the right to a minimum to the left of quantity Q asterisk and a little below curve M R. Curve A V C then moves upward and to the right, intersects curve M R again slightly to the right of quantity Q asterisk, and continues a short distance to end a little above curve M R. The A T C curve begins to the right of the top of the vertical axis and moves downward and to the right to a minimum at quantity Q asterisk a short distance above curve M R. Curve A T C then moves upward and to the right and ends high above the end of the horizontal axis. The M C curve begins to the right of the vertical axis below curve M R and moves downward and to the right a short distance to reach a minimum to the left of quantity Q asterisk approximately halfway between the horizontal axis and curve M R. Curve M C then moves upward and to the right steeply, intersects curve A V C below curve M R, then intersects curve M R slightly to the left of quantity Q asterisk, and intersects curve A T C at quantity Q asterisk and above curve M R.
