    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a velocity versus time graph. The horizontal axis is labeled t, in seconds, and the vertical axis is labeled v, in units of meters per second. The numbers appearing on the horizontal axis, from left to right, range from 10 to 40 in increments of 10. The numbers appearing on the vertical axis, from bottom to top, range from negative 20 to 20. The graph begins at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes and moves up and to the right in a straight line to the coordinates of 10 seconds, 20 meters per second. The graph then, decreases steeply down and to the right in a straight line. At coordinates of 20 seconds, negative 20 meters per second, the line stays at a constant velocity of negative 20 meters per second as time increases to the end of the horizontal axis.\" src=\"/images/2e4b70f32d024eb840c17bf9232e9887.png\"></p><p>An object begins at position <em>x</em> = 0 and moves one-dimensionally along the <em>x</em>-axis with a velocity <em>v </em>expressed as a function of time <em>t</em> according to the graph above.
