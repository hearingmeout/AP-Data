    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\" The figure shows three springs, each hanging vertically and fixed at the top. The spring on the left has nothing hanging on it. The spring in the middle has a 3 kilogram mass hanging from its free end, and the length of the spring is indicated to be 12 centimeters longer than the spring on the left. The spring on the right has a 4 kilogram mass hanging from its free end, and the length of the spring is shown to be the same as the spring on the left. \" height=\"104\" src=\"/images/be264188cc8e37d4e23f239db3b30f5d.png\" width=\"165\"></p>\n\n<p>A block of mass 3.0 kg is hung from a spring, causing it to stretch 12 cm at equilibrium, as shown above. The 3.0 kg block is then replaced by a 4.0 kg block, and the new block is released from the position shown above, at which the spring is unstretched. How far will the 4.0 kg block fall before its direction is reversed?</p>\n",
