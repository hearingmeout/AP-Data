The block is moved to the left so that the spring is compressed a distance <em>x</em> from equilibrium and then released from rest. The block has kinetic energy <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> when it separates from the spring. When the spring is compressed a distance 2<em>x</em> and the block is released from rest, the kinetic energy of the block when it separates from the spring is</p>\n",
