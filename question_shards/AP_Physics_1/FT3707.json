The horizontal axis is labeled x, the vertical axis is labeled F, and the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis is labeled O. The axis labels appearing on the horizontal axis from left to right are d, 2d, and 3d. The axis labels appearing on the vertical axis from bottom to top are negative F sub zero and F sub zero. The graph of the line begins on the vertical axis at F sub zero and moves horizontally to the coordinate d, F sub zero. There is then a straight line down and to the right from coordinate d, F sub zero to coordinate 3d, negative F sub zero and passing through the horizontal axis at coordinate 2d. \" height=\"164\" src=\"/images/82c986257768a382be2260b37fa36b2f.png\" width=\"265\"></p>\n\n<p>An object is moving in the positive <em>x</em>-direction while a net force directed along the <em>x</em>-axis is exerted on the object. The figure above shows the force as a function of position. What is the net work done on the object over the distance shown?</p>\n",
