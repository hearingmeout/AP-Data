To the right of the center at the edge of the disk, a small spring is shown with its length along the horizontal radius of the circle. A ball is at the end of the spring at the edge of the disk with an arrow pointing to the right indicating that the spring pushes the ball in this direction.\" maxwidth=\"100\" src=\"/images/6adb2090ee8d0004ff95a9a823c13ab4.png\" width=\"100\"></p><p>A compressed spring mounted on a disk can project a small ball. When the disk is not rotating, as shown in the top view above, the ball moves radially outward. The disk then rotates in a counterclockwise direction as seen from above, and the ball is projected outward at the instant the disk is in the position shown above. Which of the following best shows the subsequent path of the ball relative to the ground?</p>",
