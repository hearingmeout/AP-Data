Starting at zero, tick marks are shown on the y-axis in 5 newton increments up to 25 nNewtons and on the x-axis in 1 second increments up to 4 seconds. Solid  horizontal lines are drawn from the y-axis tick marks and solid vertical lines are drawn from the x-axis tick marks, forming a grid. Five points are marked on the graph: force 5 nNewtons and time zero seconds, force approximately 9 nNewtons and time 1 second, force approximately 16 nNewtons and time 2 seconds, force approximately 21 nNewtons and time 3 seconds, andforce approximately 24 nNewtons and time 4 seconds.\" src=\"/images/2a074b74cc2c356c05a36d9c93095d4b.png\" width=\"200\"></p><p>A student obtains data on the magnitude of force applied to an object as a function of time and displays the data on the graph above.</p><p>Answer the following question for the information and diagram above.</p><p>The increase in the momentum of the object between <em>t</em> = 0 s and <em>t</em> = 4 s is most nearly</p>",
