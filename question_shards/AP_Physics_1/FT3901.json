The ball is shown in 4 different positions along an arc. A dashed arc connects all four ball positions along the arc. Position 1 is indicated with a solid straight horizontal line to the right of the center of the arc. Position 4 creates a right angle with Position 1 and is represented with a dashed string that points vertically down from the center of the arc. Position 2 is a third of the way along the arc from Position 1 and is represented with a straight dashed line that is down and to the right of the center of the arc.  Position 3 is a third of the way along the arc from Position 2 and is represented by a dashed line that is down and to the right of the center of the arc.    \" height=\"173\" src=\"/images/9d4127755ffb489df406c8d30b1d6d53.png\" width=\"165\"></p>\n\n<p>A ball is suspended by a lightweight string, as shown in the figure above. The ball is displaced to position 1 and released. The four labeled positions are evenly spaced along the arc of the ball’s motion. Between which adjacent pairs of positions is the change in kinetic energy of the ball greatest?</p>\n",
