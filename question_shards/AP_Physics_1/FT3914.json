The figure on the right shows a cutout of the horizontal rod and a solid rod at a slight upward angle to the right of the pivot. A sphere is directly below the right end of the cutout of the horizontal rod, and a directional arrow pointing vertically down from the sphere is labeled p sub f.   \" src=\"/images/6d0bf556afd5717679e010e45fabcab5.png\"></p><p>A thin rod of length <em>d </em>on a frictionless surface is pivoted about one end, as shown above, and can rotate freely. The rod is at rest when it is struck by a sphere with linear momentum of magnitude <em>p<sub>i</sub> </em>perpendicular to the rod. The sphere rebounds along its original line of motion with momentum of magnitude <em>p<sub>f</sub></em>. What is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the rod immediately after the collision?</p>",
