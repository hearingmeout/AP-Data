The top position shows the gazelle standing on the left side of the horizontal surface and the lion on the right side. The lion is running toward the gazelle. The gazelle appears to be standing still and is looking away from the lion.   The middle position shows the gazelle on the left side of the horizontal surface and the lion in the middle. The lion is now closer to the gazelle and both animals are running toward each other.   The third position shows the gazelle on the ride side of the horizontal surface and the lion in the middle. The gazelle is running away from the lion, which is chasing the gazelle. Both animals are running toward the right. \" src=\"/images/5331560e437e4aee9d5cafee2b302dc4.png\" width=\"200\"></p><p>A lion is running at constant speed toward a gazelle that is standing still, as shown in the top figure above. After several seconds, the gazelle notices the lion and accelerates directly toward him, hoping to pass the lion and force him to reverse direction. As the gazelle accelerates toward and past the lion, the lion changes direction and accelerates in pursuit of the gazelle. The lion and the gazelle eventually each reach constant but different speeds. Which of the following sets of graphs shows a reasonable representation of the velocities of the lion and the gazelle as functions of time?</p>",
