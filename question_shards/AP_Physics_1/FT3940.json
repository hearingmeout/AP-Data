The other end of the spring is attached to a wall. There is friction between the block and the surface. A person displaces the block from its equilibrium position and releases it. Which of the following shows the mechanical energy <em>E</em> as a function of time <em>t</em> for the system that includes only the block and the system that includes the block and spring?</p>\n",

Each section starts at the horizontal axis, rises to a maximum value that is less than the starting height of the first section, is concave down and returns to the horizontal axis.
