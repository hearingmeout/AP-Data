The figure on the left is titled Position A. The block is labeled m equals four point zero kilograms. Attached to the bottom of the block is an uncompressed vertical spring labeled k equals 500 newtons per meter. A doubled-headed arrow between the horizontal surface and the bottom face of the block indicates it is 30 centimeters above the horizontal surface.    The figure on the right is titled Position B. Attached to the bottom of the block is a compressed vertical spring. A doubled-headed arrow between the horizontal surface and the bottom face of the block indicates it is 20 centimeters above the horizontal surface.  \" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/8b7918bf934ae1aa05fa44235ec3ca2e.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p>A person holds a 4.0 kg block at position A shown above on the left, in contact with an uncompressed vertical spring with a spring constant of 500 N/m. The person gently lowers the block from rest at position A to rest at position B. Which of the following describes the change in the energy of the block-spring-Earth system as a result of the block being lowered?</p>",
