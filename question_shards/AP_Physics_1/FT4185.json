The first figure shows a rod with two identical spheres, one attached to each end of the rod and directional curved arrows indicate a clockwise movement. To the right of the rod and spheres is a vertical arrow pointing down. The second figure shows a gridded velocity versus time graph in the first quadrant. The horizontal axis is labeled t, in units of seconds and increments of zero point one. The vertical axis is labeled v, in unites of meters per second and increments of zero point two five, and the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled O. Two curves are shown on the graph. The dark one starts concave up from t = zero to t = zero point one, then concave down from t = zero point one to t = zero point two, then concave up from t = zero point two to t = zero point three, then concave down from t = zero point three to t = zero point four. The lighter curve has the opposite concaves. In addition to oscillating in the different concave regions, the two curves both tend to increase upward and to the right. The two curves intersect at approximately t = zero point one, t = zero point two, t = zero point three and t = zero point four. \" height=\"318\" src=\"/images/c7c800d3a1e2d41f2bd1988f1acb5057.png\" width=\"325\"></p>\n\n<p>A student on another planet has two identical spheres, each of mass 0.6 kg, attached to the ends of a rod of negligible mass. The student gives the assembly a rotation in the vertical plane and then releases it so it falls, as shown in the top figure above. Sensors record the vertical velocity of the two spheres, and the data is shown in the graph of velocity <em>v </em>as a function of time <em>t</em>. Another student wants to calculate the assembly’s angular speed and the change in the linear momentum of the center of mass of the assembly between 0 s and 0.3 s. Which of these quantities can be determined using the graph?</p>\n",
