One of the blocks is hanging by the string in the air to the right of the table, below the tabletop but above the floor. The block is labeled Block A. From Block A, the string goes vertically upward to the pulley, which is attached to the right edge of the tabletop. The string passes over the pulley, and then goes horizontally to the left toward the other block, which is on the tabletop. The string is attached to the right side of this block, which is labeled Block B. \" height=\"157\" src=\"/images/fa706e3b1bdc4bfa2db36de30f4f31de.png\" width=\"225\"></p>\n\n<p>Block <em>A </em>hangs from a light string that passes over a light pulley and is attached to block <em>B</em>, which is on a level horizontal frictionless table, as shown above. Students are to determine the mass of block <em>B </em>from the motion of the two-block system after it is released from rest. They plan to measure the time block <em>A </em>takes to reach the floor. The students must also take which of the following measurements to determine the mass of block <em>B</em>?</p>\n",
