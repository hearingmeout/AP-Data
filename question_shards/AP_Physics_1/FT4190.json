The long axis of the dashed ellipse lies along the horizontal, and the short axis of the dashed ellipse lies along the vertical. The figure indicates the position of the Planet and the relative locations of points A, B, and the Moon on the ellipse. Point A is the rightmost point on the long axis and is directly opposite point B. Point B is the leftmost point on the long axis. The Planet lies on the horizontal axis and is located inside the ellipse, very close to point B. The Moon lies close to the topmost point on the ellipse, a little closer to point A than point B. \" src=\"/images/79c943574d981f76752bafaf6e7807d1.png\" width=\"200\"></p>\n\n<p>A moon is in an elliptical orbit about a planet as shown above. At point <em>A </em>the moon has speed <em>μ<sub>A</sub></em> and is at distance <em>R<sub>A</sub></em> from the planet. At point <em>B </em>the moon has speed <em>μ<sub>B</sub></em>. Which of the following explains a correct method for determining the distance of the moon from the planet at point <em>B </em>in terms of the given quantities?</p>\n",
