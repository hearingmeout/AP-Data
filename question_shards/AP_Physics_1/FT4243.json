The graph starts on the y-vertical axis at a point above the x-horizontal axis, then decreases linearly decreasing straight line to the right through pointsA then through and point B. The graph then becomes curved and concave up, reaching a minimum at point C which is still above the x-horizontal axis. The graph then becomes linear is an increasing straight line to the right and increasing through point D then through point E. \" src=\"/images/d71de4e6f7f7a53194d01768900c897c.png\"></p><p>The motion of a particle along a straight line is represented by the\n position <em>versus </em>time graph above.
