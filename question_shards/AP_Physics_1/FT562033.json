    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a line drawing of a pendulum. There is a solid horizontal line at the top of the figure. A straight, vertical, solid line connects the horizontal line to a solid line circle at the bottom of the figure. There is also a dashed line representing the pendulum when it is at its maximum height. One end of the dashed line is where the solid horizontal and vertical lines meet. From there, the dashed line is oriented down and to the left. The lower left end of the dashed line is connected to a dashed line circle, located to the left of and slightly higher than the solid line circle. There is a straight, horizontal dashed line that goes from the bottom of the solid circle to the left. The distance between this horizontal dashed line and the bottom of the dashed circle is labeled h. \" height=\"341\" src=\"/images/f255220b2d0b25d3c5737aadb0b222b0.png\" width=\"200\"></p>\n\n<p>The pendulum shown in the figure above reaches a maximum height <em>h</em> above the equilibrium position as it oscillates. Assuming friction and air resistance are negligible, which of the following is true about the total energy of the Earth-pendulum system as the pendulum oscillates?</p>\n",
