As the disk slides by, a child uses a rubber mallet to hit the disk at point X, exerting a force directly toward the center of the disk. The child hits point X every half second for about 10 s, changing the trajectory of the disk but not causing it to rotate. Which of the following most closely approximates the path of the disk while the child is hitting it?</p>",
