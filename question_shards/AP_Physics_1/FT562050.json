The blocks initially slide together on a frictionless surface with velocity 2 m/s to the right. The spring is then released by remote control. At some later instant, the left block is moving at 1 m/s to the left, and the other block is moving to the right. What is the speed of the center of mass of the system at that instant? </p>",
