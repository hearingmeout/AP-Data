There are evenly spaced horizontal grid lines, which intersect the vertical axis at points labeled 2 through 14, in increments of 2. The graph begins at zero comma 8. It moves in a straight line up through 1 comma 10 to 2 comma 12. From there it moves down in a straight line through 3 comma 11 and 4 comma 10, and it ends at 5 comma 9. \" height=\"301\" src=\"/images/b0757c4876e480c5dd400034575f2fe3.png\" width=\"280\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the position x as a function of time for the center of mass of a system of particles of total mass 6.0 kg.
