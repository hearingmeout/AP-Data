A block of mass M is suspended from the far end of the beam by a cable. A support cable runs from the wall to the outer edge of the beam. Both cables are of negligible mass. The wall exerts a force F<sub>W</sub> on the left end of the beam. For which of the following actions is the magnitude of the vertical component of F<sub>W</sub> smallest?</p>\n",
