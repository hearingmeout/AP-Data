In the left hand figure, the spring has length L and there is no object attached to its bottom end. In the middle figure, the spring has a block labeled m attached to its bottom end. The spring is now 5 centimeters longer than in the left figure. In the right hand figure, the spring still has the block labeled m attached to its bottom end. A hand on the block is shown pulling the spring downward so that the spring is 5 centimeters longer than in the middle figure. \" height=\"393\" src=\"/images/575613f548519595dd2523356112d43c.png\" width=\"375\"></p>\n\n<p>An object with mass m is suspended at rest from a spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m . The length of the spring is 5.0 cm longer than its unstretched length <em>L</em>, as shown above. A person then exerts a force on the object and stretches the spring an additional 5.0 cm. What is the total energy stored in the spring at the new stretched length?</p>\n",
