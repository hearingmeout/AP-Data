On each graph, the horizontal axis is labeled t in seconds, the vertical axis is labeled x in centimeters, and the origin is labeled 0. The tick marks on the horizontal axes are labeled 2 to 8, in increments of 2, and the tick marks on the vertical axis are labeled negative 20 to 20, in increments of 10. The curve for Block A resembles a cosine function and begins on the vertical axis at 10 centimeters. The graph has 5 peaks at x equals 10 centimeters at time equals zero, 2, 4, 6, and 8 seconds, and has 4 troughs at x equals negative 10 centimeters at time equals 1, 3, 5, and 7 seconds. The curve for block B resembles a cosine function and begins on the vertical axis at 20 centimeters. The graph has 3 peaks at x equals 20 centimeters at time equals zero, 4, and 8 seconds, and has 2 troughs at x equals negative 20 centimeters at time equals 2 and 6 seconds.\" height=\"227\" src=\"/images/474c4f97a1e6aa3fc96e64da605f855b.png\" width=\"665\"></p>\n\n<p>Two blocks are connected to identical ideal springs and are oscillating on a horizontal frictionless surface. Block A has mass m, and its motion is represented by the graph of position as a function of time shown above on the left. Block B’s motion is represented above on the right.
