The plane is inclined 30 degrees from the horizontal, and at the bottom of the plane, there is a short curved section that transitions to a horizontal surface. The block is labeled A, and is at rest at the top of the inclined plane. The distance from the right side of block A to the horizontal surface is labeled 3 point 6 meters. There are two blocks on the horizontal surface, a short distance beyond the bottom of the incline. Block A, drawn with dashed lines to represent its position some time after it has been released from rest, is touching a larger block labeled B.\" height=\"136\" src=\"/images/fcf1935af990bd61f7ef0420ad77c722.png\" width=\"365\"></p>\n\n<p>Block A of mass 2.0 kg is released from rest at the top of a 3.6 m long plane inclined at an angle of 30º, as shown in the figure above. After sliding on the horizontal surface, block <em>A</em> hits and sticks to block <em>B</em>, which is at rest and has mass 3.0 kg. Assume friction is negligible.
