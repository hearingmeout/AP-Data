    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure presents two drawings labeled &quot;Figure 1&quot; and &quot;Figure 2.&quot; Both figures show the same student moving a box to a loading dock platform, represented by a large shaded square. In Figure 1, the student is pushing the box upward and to the right on an incline. There is a rightward pointing, diagonal arrow drawn parallel to the incline. The incline is leaning against the square loading dock platform. In Figure 2, the student is lifting the box straight upward next to the square shaped platform. There is a vertical arrow pointing upward drawn under the box. \" height=\"448\" src=\"/images/559a844ea68ffc359f94787b3fb939d9.png\" width=\"315\"></p>\n\n<p>A student is asked to move a box from ground level to the top of a loading dock platform, as shown in the figures above. In Figure 1, the student pushes the box up an incline with negligible friction. In Figure 2, the student lifts the box straight up from ground level to the loading dock platform. In which case does the student do more work on the box, and why?</p>\n",
