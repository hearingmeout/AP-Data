    "prompt": "A projectile fired into the air explodes and splits into two halves of equal mass that hit the ground at the same time. If the projectile had not exploded, it would have landed at point <em>X</em>, which is a distance <em>R</em> to the right of the launch point. After the explosion, one of the halves lands at point <em>Y</em>, which is a distance 2<em>R</em> to the right of the launch point. If air resistance is negligible, where did the other half land?",
