The horizontal axis is labeled “x, in meters,” and the numbers 0 through 4 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Force, in newtons,” and the numbers negative 5 through 10, in increments of 5, are indicated. The line begins at 10 newtons at 0 meters, and then moves horizontally to the right, until it reaches 10 newtons at 2 meters. It then moves vertically downward, until it reaches negative 5 newtons at 2 meters. It then moves horizontally to the right, until it ends at negative 5 newtons at 4 meters.\" src=\"/images/340a3d2602294100d469100f1b03a52e.png\"></p>\n\n<p>A cart is moving on a level track in the positive <em>x</em>-direction. A force acting parallel to the <em>x</em>-axis is exerted on the cart. The graph above shows the net force exerted on the cart as a function of displacement. As the cart travels from <em>x</em> = 0 m to <em>x</em> = 4 m , what is the net change in the kinetic energy of the cart?</p>\n",
