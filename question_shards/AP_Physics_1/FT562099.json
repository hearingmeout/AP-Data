A sphere labeled A is on a horizontal surface, and an arrow pointing to the right just above the sphere is labeled v. Another sphere, labeled B, is at the right end of the horizontal surface. A vertical line connects the top of sphere B to a point P directly above sphere B. Point P is on the bottom of a horizontal rectangular section representing a ceiling. The distance between point P and the center of sphere B is labeled R.\" height=\"157\" src=\"/images/eac9cdd840cccbd87f8ff4571ff84b2b.png\" width=\"210\"></p>\n\n<p>Steel sphere A of mass <em>M</em> is moving along a horizontal surface with constant speed <em>v</em>. Identical steel sphere <em>B</em> is at rest and hangs on a string of length <em>R</em> attached to a support at point <em>P</em>, as shown in the figure above. The spheres collide, and as a result sphere A stops and sphere <em>B</em> swings a vertical height <em>h</em> before coming momentarily to rest. Knowing values for which of the following will allow determination of the angular impulse on sphere <em>B</em> with respect to <em>P</em> due to the collision?</p>\n",
