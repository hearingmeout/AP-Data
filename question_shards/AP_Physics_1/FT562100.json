In the diagram on the left, labeled &quot;Figure 1,&quot; a hand is holding the block in place and the spring is unstretched. A dashed horizontal line, labeled &quot;Block position with unstretched spring,&quot; is drawn at the top of the block, where the spring is attached to the block. In the diagram on the right, labeled &quot;Figure 2,&quot; the spring is stretched and the block is lower than it was in Figure 1. A dashed horizontal line labeled, &quot;Block position with unstretched spring,&quot; is drawn at the same vertical position as in Figure 1, and another dashed horizontal line is drawn at the top of the block. The distance between the two dashed lines is labeled as 0 point 2 0 meter, indicating the block has descended by that distance.\" height=\"195\" src=\"/images/7fe91062fe16e576867862ab586156a9.png\" width=\"430\"></p>\n\n<p>A 1.0 kg block is attached to an unstretched spring of spring constant 50 N/m and released from rest from the position shown in Figure 1 above. The block oscillates for a while and eventually stops moving 0.20 m below its starting point, as shown in Figure 2. What is the change in potential energy of the block-spring-Earth system between Figure 1 and Figure 2 ?</p>\n",
