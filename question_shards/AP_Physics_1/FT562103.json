    "prompt": "A cart of mass m is moving with negligible friction along a track with known speed <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> to the right. It collides with and sticks to a cart of mass 4<em>m</em> moving with known speed <em>v<sub>2</sub></em> to the right. Which of the two principles, conservation of momentum and conservation of mechanical energy, must be applied to determine the final speed of the carts, and why?",
