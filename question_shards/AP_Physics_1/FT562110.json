    "prompt": "In a classroom at time <em>t</em> = 0 , a sphere is thrown upward at a 45° angle to the horizontal. At time <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>, while the sphere is still rising, it bounces off the ceiling elastically and with no friction. Which of the following pairs of graphs could represent the sphere’s horizontal velocity and vertical velocity as functions of time <em>t</em>?",
