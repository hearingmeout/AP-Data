The Force Sensor is against a wall and to the left of the cart. There is a horizontal arrow to the left of the cart that is pointing toward the Force Sensor. The figure on the bottom consists of two graphs in the first quadrant. The graph on the left is labeled Graph one. The horizontal axis is labeled Time, and the vertical axis is labeled Force. The graph on the right is labeled Graph two. The horizontal axis is labeled Position, and the vertical axis is labeled Force.\" height=\"287\" src=\"/images/4b1284a1af515b0c4eba9443c52594ba.png\" width=\"320\"></p>\n\n<p>A cart of known mass moves with known speed along a level, frictionless track, as shown in the figure above. The cart hits a force sensor and rebounds. The force sensor measures the force exerted on the cart as a function of time and as a function of the position of the cart. The results will be graphed on the axes shown. Which of the two graphs can be used to determine the cart’s speed after it rebounds?</p>\n",
