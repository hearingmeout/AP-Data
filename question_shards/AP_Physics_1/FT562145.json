    "prompt": "Two identical blocks are connected to the opposite ends of a compressed spring. The blocks initially slide together on a frictionless surface with velocity <em>v</em> to the right. The spring is then released by remote control. At some later instant, the left block is moving at <em>v</em>/2 to the left, and the other block is moving to the right. What is the speed of the center of mass of the system at that instant?",
