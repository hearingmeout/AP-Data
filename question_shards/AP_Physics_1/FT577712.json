The horizontal axis is labeled &quot;Time, in seconds,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 6, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Force, in newtons,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 5, are indicated. The line has small amounts of scatter, making the line appear slightly jagged. The line begins at approximately 0 seconds, 0 newtons and moves generally upward and to the right until it reaches approximately 2 seconds, 10 newtons. It then moves horizontally and to the right until it reaches approximately 4 seconds, 10 newtons. It then moves upward and to the right until it ends at approximately 6 seconds, 19 newtons. \" height=\"219\" src=\"/images/9b33c6d250c53e36082545c710f06721.png\" width=\"250\"></p>\n\n<p>During an experiment a student records the net horizontal force exerted on an object moving in a straight line along a horizontal frictionless track. The graph above shows the force as a function of time. Of the following, which is the best approximation of the magnitude of the change in momentum of the object between 0 s and 4 s?</p>\n",
