The paths of the stars are both ellipses of the same size and shape, and intersect one another. The major (long) axes of the two ellipses lie along the same line. The positions of each star along its path at four different times are labeled as 1, 2, 3, or 4. The stars are farthest apart when each star is at position 2 in its respective path. The stars are closest together at position 4. The stars are an intermediate distance apart at positions 1 and 3. One star is represented by gray circles, and the other star is represented by white circles. The circles have solid lines to indicate the stars at position 1, and dashed lines to indicate the stars at positions 2, 3, and 4.\" height=\"132\" src=\"/images/0ea078c3643c53b2f12e99521d27be66.png\" width=\"200\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows the paths of two stars of equal mass as they orbit their common center of mass.
