There are 4 arrows of force pointing downward on the stick from above. From left to right these are labeled as follows: 40 newtons at the far left end, 60 newtons at one-quarter of the length from the left end, 30 newtons at the middle of the stick, and 150 newtons at three-quarters of the length from the left end. The right end of the stick has a dot and does not have an arrow pointing toward it.\" height=\"159\" src=\"/images/cbc8d3201540fff8fa2954e7c514f287.png\" width=\"250\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above represents a stick of uniform density that is attached to a pivot at the right end and has equally spaced marks along its length. Any one of the four forces shown can be exerted on the stick as indicated. Which force will create the largest rate of change in the stick’s angular momentum?</p>\n",
