The figure is labeled “Top View.” The rod has a point labeled P that is about one fourth of the rod’s length from the left end of the rod. There are three downward pointing arrows along the length of the rod, with the arrowheads touching the rod. One arrow is pointing toward the left end of the rod, one arrow is pointing toward point P, and one arrow is pointing toward the right end of the rod.\" height=\"110\" src=\"/images/15b0cb9c3cc8b201747809a131cdfeab.png\" width=\"250\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows a rod that is fixed to a horizontal surface at pivot <em>P</em>. The rod is initially rotating without friction in the counterclockwise direction. At time <em>t</em>, three forces of equal magnitude are applied to the rod as shown. Which of the following is true about the angular speed and direction of rotation of the rod immediately after time <em>t </em>?</p>\n",
