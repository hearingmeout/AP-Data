There is significant air resistance opposing the ball’s motion, so the magnitude of the ball’s acceleration is <u>not</u> equal to <em>g</em>. At time <em>t</em>, the ball is moving up and to the right at an angle of 45° to the horizontal, as shown above. Which of the following best shows the magnitude <em>a </em>and the direction of the ball’s acceleration at time <em>t</em> ?</p>\n",
