In a second experiment, the student rolls a 5 kg ball such that it collides with the wall at a force of 5000 N. In both experiments, the balls bounce back from the wall and eventually come to rest. Which of the following statements is true regarding the force that the wall exerts on each ball?</p>\n",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The wall exerts the same force on both balls since they both bounce back from the same wall in both experiments.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The wall exerts a greater force on the 5 kg ball than on the 2 kg ball since a greater force is required to cause the heavier ball to bounce back from the wall.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The wall exerts a greater force on the 2 kg ball than on the 5 kg ball since the force from the wall on each ball is equal to the force that each ball exerts on the wall.</p>",
