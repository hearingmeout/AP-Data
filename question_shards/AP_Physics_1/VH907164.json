Brick 1 is on top of brick 2, which is in contact with the floor. The force diagram for brick 2 is given, with three forces indicated and extending from a point in the middle of brick 2. F sub 1 points downward. F sub g points downward and has greater magnitude than F sub 1. F sub N points upward and has greater magnitude than F sub g.\" height=\"239\" src=\"/images/85c7d0b38731c951b1048c4e735202bc.png\" width=\"450\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Two bricks are stacked on a floor. A student draws the force diagram for brick 2, as shown above. The forces are an upward normal force, a downward force exerted by brick 1, and a downward gravitational force. How many of the forces, if any, in the force diagram are contact forces caused by microscopic interactions?</p>\n",
