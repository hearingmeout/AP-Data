One curve is labeled Dart, and the other is labeled Target. The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and vertical axis is labeled “Vertical Velocity.” Two evenly spaced vertical gridlines and two evenly spaced horizontal gridlines are drawn on the graph. The curve labeled Dart begins near the top of the vertical axis, at the topmost horizontal gridline, and moves steadily downward and to the right. It crosses the first vertical gridline, above the horizontal axis, and ends far to the right of the vertical axis, at the intersection of the second vertical gridline and the horizontal axis. The line labeled Target starts at the origin, and moves steadily downward and to the right. It crosses the second vertical gridline, below the horizontal axis, and ends far to the right of the vertical axis, at the intersection of the second vertical gridline and bottommost horizontal gridline.\" height=\"217\" src=\"/images/365379352718b987fc25f52fb30d7a8a.png\" width=\"350\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student makes the necessary measurements to create the graph shown, which represents the vertical component of the velocity as a function of time for the dart and for the target from <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t equals 0\"><math alttext=\"t equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> until the instant the dart hits the target.
