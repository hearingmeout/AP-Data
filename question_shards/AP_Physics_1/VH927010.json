For each of the four strings shown, one end is attached to the small ring, and the other end is attached to a hanger that can hold masses. Each string is wrapped around a pulley so that the hanger and masses are at rest. The location of each pulley may be changed. Figure&nbsp;2 shows a top-down view of the free-body diagram of the forces exerted on the pin at a particular moment in time. From a top-down perspective, in what direction will the pin accelerate?</p>\n",
