The dots in the center are spaced further apart. There is a rightward pointing arrow which points to the right in the positive x direction drawn above the ticker tape.\" height=\"78\" src=\"/images/ac0e2f8206c6344a6560041776b42412.png\" width=\"475\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student performs an experiment in which the horizontal position of a toy car is recorded on ticker tape from a device that places dots on the tape in equal time intervals. The series of dots in the figure represents the motion of an object moving from the negative direction to the positive direction along the horizontal direction. The time interval between each recorded dot is <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1 second\"><math alttext=\"1 second\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.4em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
