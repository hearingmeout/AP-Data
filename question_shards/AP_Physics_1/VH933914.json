The vertical axis is labeled “v, in meters per second,” and the numbers 10 through 40, in increments of 10, are indicated. The line labeled Object 1 begins at the point with coordinates 0 seconds comma 40 meters per second, and moves steadily downward and to the right. It passes through the following three points: &nbsp;coordinates 1 second comma 30 meters per second; coordinates 2 seconds comma 20 meters per second, and coordinates 3 seconds comma 10 meters per second.
