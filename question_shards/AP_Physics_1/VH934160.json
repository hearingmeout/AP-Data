The line starts at the point with coordinates 0 seconds, comma 10 meters per second, and moves steadily downward and to the right. It passes through the following three points: with coordinates 1.0 second, comma 8 meters per second; coordinates 2.0 seconds, comma 6 meters per second; and coordinates 3.0 seconds, comma 4 meters per second.
