The system oscillates near Earth’s surface. The system is then taken to the Moon’s surface, where the gravitational field strength is nearly <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"one sixth\"><math alttext=\"one sixth\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> that of the gravitational field strength near Earth's surface.
