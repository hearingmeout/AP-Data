In the experiment, frictional forces CANNOT be neglected. The student uses experimental data to create two graphs. Figure 1 is a graph of kinetic energy of the object as a function of time. Figure 2 is a graph of the object-Earth system’s gravitational potential energy as a function of time. How should the student use one or both graphs to determine how much the total mechanical energy changes after <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"5 seconds\"><math alttext=\"5 seconds\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> ?</p>\n",
