The horizontal axis is labeled Time in seconds and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 0.5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Angular Momentum in kilogram meter squared per second and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 2, are indicated. All data are approximate. The first data point begins at coordinates 0 comma 0. The data points trend gradually upward and to the right at a constant rate. The final data point is located near coordinates 2.0 comma 8.\" height=\"185\" src=\"/images/1f328b56f7e854eb5c6cb7ffa41ceb59.png\" width=\"315\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student conducts an experiment in which one end of a rod may freely rotate around a pivot that is attached to its other end. The student collects the necessary data to construct a graph of the rod’s angular momentum as a function of time, as shown. The student makes the following claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">“This graph shows that the magnitude of the net torque exerted on the rod increases as time increases.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements is correct about the student’s evaluation of the data from the graph?
