The midpoint of the ramp is indicated by a dot halfway down the ramp. The ramp surface is divided into seven sections of approximately equal length, three of which are shaded and four of which are unshaded. Starting from the upper left, there is an unshaded section followed by a shaded section. These are followed by alternating unshaded and shaded sections, with the final section unshaded. The middle of the three shaded sections includes the midpoint.\" height=\"113\" src=\"/images/4016be4bb6d9b634260f5dae6869b157.png\" width=\"350\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A block is released from rest and slides down a ramp. The surface of the ramp has three rough sections where the friction between the surface and the block is not negligible, as shown by the shaded regions above. Measuring which of the following will allow for the best estimate of the block’s instantaneous acceleration when the block is at the midpoint of the ramp?</p>\n",
