The horizontal axis is labeled t, in seconds, and the numbers 2 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled F, in newtons, and the numbers negative 8 through 8, in increments of 2, are indicated. The graph consists of several points, as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The points begin on the vertical axis at 4 newtons, and trend almost horizontally rightward with some scatter until reaching 15 seconds and 4 newtons. At this point, a few points trend almost vertically downward until reaching approximately 15 seconds and negative 8 newtons. The points then trend almost horizontally rightward until reaching approximately 20 seconds and negative newtons, At this point, a few points move vertically upward before ending just below the horizontal axis.\" height=\"211\" src=\"/images/0706908593d79d852c9fb71fce98fa7c.png\" width=\"255\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A stationary cart attached to a force gauge is on a straight, horizontal, frictionless track.
