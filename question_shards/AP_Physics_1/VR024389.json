The horizontal axis is labeled t, in seconds, and the numbers 5 through 15, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled v, in meters per second, and the numbers negative 3 through 2, in increments of 1, are indicated. The graph consists of several points, as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The points begin slightly above 1 meter per second on the vertical axis, and trend steadily downward and to the right until reaching the horizontal axis at approximately 3 seconds. At this point, the points move horizontally rightward until reaching 5 seconds on the horizontal axis, and then trend steadily downward and to the right until reaching 10 seconds and negative 2 meters per second. At this point, the points move horizontally to the right until they end below the horizontal axis at approximately 12 s.\" height=\"173\" src=\"/images/f2293a34af0d91af9c4299c677e9fb41.png\" width=\"265\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An engineer measures the velocity <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"v\"><math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> of a remote-controlled cart on a straight track at regular time intervals.
