The dashed curve ends at a height about the same as where it began. In the Firecracker diagram, a dashed line moves steeply upward and to the right and ends as it begins to level out, high above and to the right of where it began.\" height=\"121\" src=\"/images/efa31cf991af665c18d734ed6d3e6cba.png\" width=\"300\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A rock and a firecracker are each thrown into the air at the same angle and with the same initial speed. The rock follows the trajectory shown above on the left. The firecracker initially follows the same trajectory as the rock but explodes into three pieces at the point indicated above on the right. Which of the following describes the motion of the center of mass of the firecracker pieces after the explosion?</p>\n",
