In the “After Collision” diagram, cart 1 has collided with cart 2 and both carts are now moving toward the right side of the diagram.\" height=\"169\" src=\"/images/5aeae3aaf32fd5892565d109918a82d6.png\" width=\"300\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Carts 1 and 2 are initially moving toward each other, as shown in the top figure. The carts collide and afterward are both moving to the right, as shown in the bottom figure. If the positive direction is to the right, which of the following best represents the force exerted on each cart by the other during the collision as a function of time?</p>\n",
