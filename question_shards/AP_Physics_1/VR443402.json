With the wheel initially at rest, a student wraps a string around the wheel and pulls the string with a spring scale, causing the wheel to rotate. The student records the tension in the string and the time for which the string was pulled. Without measuring the wheel’s final angular speed, can the student find the magnitude of the wheel’s final angular momentum, and what is a correct explanation?</p>\n",
