Blocks X and Y are shown on a ramp in both diagrams as follows. In trial 1, the two blocks, X and Y, are touching such that the right side of block X is touching the left side of block Y. In trial 2, blocks X and Y are connected by a spring that extends from the right side of block X to the left side of block Y.\" height=\"134\" src=\"/images/f8a93959ec3563a2a9f138bfb31cc026.png\" width=\"423\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Blocks X and Y are glued together and released from rest on a ramp with negligible friction, as shown in trial 1. The blocks are then separated and connected by a light spring, as shown in trial 2. The spring is compressed and the blocks are again released from rest on the ramp. Immediately after the blocks are released, is the net force on the two-block system the same or different between trial 1 and trial 2? Immediately after the blocks are released, is the net force on block Y the same or different between trial 1 and trial 2?</p>\n",
