The platform has a vertical pole through its center. In the first view, labeled “Before the Disk Drops,” a small disk is near the top of the vertical pole and is attached to it through a hole in its center. In the second view, labeled “After the Disk Drops,” the disk is at the bottom of the pole and in contact with the platform.\" height=\"125\" src=\"/images/f3ea925b4873b602a7fae9a09e42edea.png\" width=\"365\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A platform is initially rotating on smooth ice with negligible friction, as shown at left in the figure. A stationary disk is dropped directly onto the center of the platform. A short time later, the disk and platform rotate together at the same angular velocity, as shown at right in the figure. How does the angular momentum of only the platform change, if at all, after the disk drops? What is a justification for your answer?</p>\n",
