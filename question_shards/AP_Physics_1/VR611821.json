The horizontal axis is labeled t, and sixteen equally spaced vertical gridlines are indicated along it. The vertical axis is labeled v, and seventeen equally spaced horizontal gridlines are indicated along it. The first line segment is labeled A. It begins at the origin, and slants gradually upward and to the right until it ends at a point where the ninth vertical gridline and the sixth horizontal gridline meet. The second line segment is labeled B. It begins where the first ends, and slants steeply upward and to the right until it ends at a point where the twelfth vertical gridline and the twelfth horizontal gridline meet.\" src=\"/images/01a7aa0ef1a6ac2944e0af66deeb4284.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A cart starts from rest and moves to the right along a flat surface.
