In the first diagram, a crate is on a horizontal surface. A rope and a dashed line extend from the middle of the right side of the block. The dashed line is horizontal and the rope extends up and to the right. The second diagram is a free-body diagram with four arrows of varying sizes extending from a common point on a coordinate grid. The first arrow points 4 units upward. The second arrow points 5 units downward. The third arrow points 2 units to the left.

The rope pulls the crate to the right across a rough horizontal surface at a constant speed. The free-body diagram on the right shows the forces exerted on the crate at the instant shown on the left. As the crate moves across the surface, the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the surface increases but the speed of the crate remains constant. Which of the following free-body diagrams could show the forces exerted on the crate a short time later, after the coefficient of friction has increased?</p>\n",
