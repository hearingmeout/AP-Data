The first diagram shows a truck on a ramp that slants downward and to the right. The truck is moving down the ramp and the front of the truck is pointing to the right. The second diagram is a free-body diagram with three arrows of varying sizes extending from a common point on a coordinate grid. The first arrow points 1 unit to the right and 3 units upward. The second arrow points 3 units to the right and 1 unit downward. The third arrow points a little more than 3 units downward.\" src=\"/images/c19345d57c4a15947744ece797fcb1e7.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A truck is moving down a ramp, as shown in the left figure. The driver is applying the brakes and the truck is slowing down. In the back of the truck, a box is at rest relative to the truck and it remains stationary relative to the truck without slipping. A student draws a free-body diagram to represent the forces acting on the box, as shown in the right figure. Another student looks at the diagram and claims that it is not correct. Which of the following correctly indicates an error in the diagram?</p>\n",
