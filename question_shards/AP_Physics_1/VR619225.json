The figure on the left shows a block at rest on an inclined surface that slants downward and to the right. The left side of the block is attached to a string, which is attached to a wall at the top of the incline. The figure on the right shows a free body diagram with four arrows extending from a dot on a gridded plane. Two arrows extend upward and to the left. Both end approximately one unit to the left, and one unit above the dot. The third arrow extends upward and to the right until its ends at a point that is 2 units to the right, and 2 units above the dot.

The block is attached to a wall by a string of negligible mass. The vector sum of the forces is zero. The right figure shows the free-body diagram for the block. The string is cut and the vector sum of the forces on the block remains zero. Which of the following free-body diagrams could show the forces exerted on the block after the string is cut?</p>\n",
