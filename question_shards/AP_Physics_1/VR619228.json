There is a force on the ball from the string directed up and to the left, and a downward gravitational force. There is also a constant flow of air around the ball, and the vector sum of all the forces exerted on the ball is equal to zero. Which of the following statements correctly indicates a possible direction of the force exerted on the ball by the air, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n",
