The figure on the left shows two blocks placed side-by-side on a horizontal surface that are moving to the right while remaining in contact with each other . The left block, which is larger than the right block, has mass 2 m. The right block has mass m. A rope extending horizontally to the right is attached to the right side of the left block, such that it is not touching the right block. The figure on the right shows a line segment in a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled O. The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “F sub 2 m, comma m, end sub.” The line segment begins on the vertical axis, one unit above the origin, and slants upward and to the right. It passes through a point 3 units to the right of the vertical axis and 2 units above the horizontal axis. It ends at a point 6 units to the right of the vertical axis and 3 units above the horizontal axis.\" src=\"/images/3d6baeea2156ec22a59b1e4e15865e13.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A rope pulls a block of mass <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2 m\"><math alttext=\"2 m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mi>m</mi></math></span></span> to the right along a horizontal surface, as shown in the left figure.
