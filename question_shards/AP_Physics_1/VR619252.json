    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A spacecraft in deep space fires its thruster, which ejects fuel from the spacecraft. The ejected fuel exerts a constant force on the spacecraft and the total mass of the spacecraft decreases at a constant rate. Which of the following graphs best represents the acceleration of the spacecraft as a function of time while the thruster is firing?</p>\n",
