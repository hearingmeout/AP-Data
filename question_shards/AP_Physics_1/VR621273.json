The acrobat then releases the bar and falls to the platform. When the acrobat lands on the platform, the platform and acrobat continue moving downward until they momentarily come to rest when the spring is compressed a maximum distance. Consider the system consisting of the acrobat and the spring. Which of the following correctly indicates the moment when the acrobat-spring system has the largest total mechanical energy, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n",
