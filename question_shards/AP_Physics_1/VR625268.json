Several trials are performed, and in each trial the total work done on the cart is the same, but the magnitude <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"F\"><math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math></span></span> of the applied force and the distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math></span></span> that the cart is pushed are varied. Which of the following graphs best represents how <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"F\"><math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math></span></span> depends on <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math></span></span>?</p>\n",
