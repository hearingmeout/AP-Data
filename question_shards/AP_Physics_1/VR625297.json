A student exerts a continuous force of magnitude <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"F\"><math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math></span></span> on the first crate that causes the crate to accelerate over a distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math></span></span> in time <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math></span></span>. The second crate is accelerated by the same continuous force of magnitude <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"F\"><math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math></span></span> over the same distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math></span></span>, but in half the time. The student claims that the same average power is delivered to both crates by the force. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?</p>\n",
