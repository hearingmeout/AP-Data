A second block of equal mass is pushed up a second, steeper ramp at the same constant speed <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"v\"><math alttext=\"v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>v</mi></math></span></span>. Frictional forces between the blocks and the ramps are negligible.
