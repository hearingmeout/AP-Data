The three objects stick together and do not move. Friction between the objects and the surface is negligible. The masses of the carts are then doubled, and the process is repeated with the carts having the same speeds as in the original scenario. How must the mass of the block change, if at all, so that after the three objects collide and stick together, they again do not move?</p>\n",
