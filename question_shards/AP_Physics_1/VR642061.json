The student then swings a heavy rod at the clay and, at the instant the clay comes to rest at its maximum height, the rod collides with the clay. The clay immediately sticks to the rod. Which of the following correctly indicates which object, if either, experiences an impulse of greater magnitude because of the collision, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n",
