The first line graph is labeled Cart 1, and begins at the point with coordinates 0 comma 0.5. It moves horizontally to the right to the point with coordinates 0.6 comma 0.5. The line graph then slants downward and to the right to the point with coordinates 0.9 comma negative 0.4. It then moves horizontally to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 1.6 comma negative 0.4.
