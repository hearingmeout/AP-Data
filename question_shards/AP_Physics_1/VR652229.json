The disk then begins to accelerate at a constant rate in the clockwise direction until the disk’s angular velocity is half its original value. Which of the following statements best describes why the angular displacement continued to increase in the counterclockwise direction even though angular acceleration was in the clockwise direction?</p>\n",
