The bar is free to rotate about a fixed a pivot at the bar’s center that anchors the center of the bar to the horizontal surface. Friction forces are negligible. As indicated by the arrows in the figure, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"F sub 1 is greater than F sub 2\"><math alttext=\"F sub 1 is greater than F sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></span></span>. A student claims that at the instant shown in the figure the pivot is exerting a nonzero force on the bar and exerting a nonzero torque on the bar about the pivot. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?</p>\n",
