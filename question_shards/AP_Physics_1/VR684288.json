The platform is attached to a vertical pole. The illustration on the left shows the student holding a weight in each hand with his arms extended outward. There is a short arrow indicating that the student is spinning clockwise. The illustration on the right shows the student holding a weight in each hand with his arms pulled in toward his body, such that the weights are touching each other.

The student holds weights out&nbsp;with extended arms and the teacher gives the student a push to cause the student to begin spinning on the&nbsp;platform with constant angular velocity. While spinning, the student pulls the weights in toward the student’s body. Which of the following correctly describes how the angular momentum of the student‑weights system changes, if at all, when the weights are pulled in and provides a valid justification?</p>\n",
