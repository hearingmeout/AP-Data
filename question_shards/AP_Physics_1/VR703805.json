The track consists of two ramps which each slope downward at the same angle, one from left to right and the other from right to left, and join in the middle. The block is at rest at the top of the ramp on the left.

The block makes a smooth transition from one ramp to another, and friction between the block and the track is negligible. The block slides back and forth along the track. Will the block undergo simple harmonic motion? Why or why not?</p>\n",

      {
