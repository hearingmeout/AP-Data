    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student observes a block attached to a spring undergo simple harmonic motion. The student claims that a block with a smaller mass attached to the same spring and oscillating with a smaller amplitude could have the same maximum kinetic energy as the original block. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?</p>\n",
    "answer": "i4",
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the less massive block will have a greater average speed.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because even though the magnitude of the average force exerted on the block decreases, the less massive block requires less force to achieve the same acceleration.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the less massive block will have less kinetic energy as the original block no matter what the amplitude is.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because changing the amplitude of the oscillation changes the initial potential energy, which is equal to the maximum kinetic energy of the block.</p>",
