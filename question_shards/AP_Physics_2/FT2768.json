    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"Two figures are shown each with a bar magnet and a loop of metal wire. Each bar magnet is labeled S on the left end and N on the right end, and an arrow next to the bar along its length points to the end labeled N and represents the direction the bar magnet is moving. Figure 1 shows the bar to the left of the loop of metal wire with the end of the bar labeled N to the left of the loop but close to it. The arrow is thus pointing toward the loop. Figure 2 shows the bar to the right of the loop of metal wire with the end of the bar labeled S to the right of the loop but close to it. The arrow is thus pointing away from the loop. There are two directional arrows on the loop in opposite directions. Looking at the loop from the side that the bar magnet is now on, the first arrow points in a clockwise direction and is labeled Direction 1. The second arrow is below the first, points in a counterclockwise direction, and is labeled Direction 2.\" src=\"/images/99fa9391f97615c16fcd892620d3fddf.png\"></p><p>A bar magnet is pushed from left to right completely through a loop of metal wire, as shown in the figures above. The two possible directions for current in the loop are also shown. Which of the following indicates the directions of the induced current in the loop, if any, as the magnet is moving through the positions shown?</p>",
