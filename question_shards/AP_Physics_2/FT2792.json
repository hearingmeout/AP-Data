The two long sections of the rail, shown horizontally on the page, are parallel to each other. They are connected at their left ends by the shorter center section, but are unconnected at the right ends. A metal bar perpendicular to the two parallel sections of the rail rests on both at a location near their center. The bar and rail are in a region of magnetic field B directed vertically downward into the plane formed by the bar and rail. An arrow from the right side of the bar points to the right to indicate the direction that it moves across the two parallel sections of the rail.\" src=\"/images/1687855da54f6c7b6c0876f9932b2139.png\"></p><p>The figure above shows a metal bar that is supported by two sections of a fixed, conducting U-shaped horizontal rail.
