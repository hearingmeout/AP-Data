The region on the left is substance 1 with refractive index n sub 1. The middle region is substance 2 with refractive index n sub 2. The region on the right is substance 3 with refractive index n sub 3. A light ray is shown traveling up and to the right in substance 1. When the ray passes into substance 2 it continues moving up and to the right, but the line is more horizontal than it was in substance 1. In region 3 the light ray returns to traveling in the same direction as it travelled in substance 1. \" src=\"/images/7371c7d05aa1f0e191d6b92c2d9c162e.png\"></p>\n\n<p>A light ray passes through substances 1, 2, and 3, as shown above. The indices of refraction for these three substances are <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>n</em><sub>3</sub>, respectively. Ray segments in 1 and in 3 are parallel. From the directions of the ray, one can conclude that</p>\n",
