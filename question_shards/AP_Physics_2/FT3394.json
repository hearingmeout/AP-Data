    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows an isosceles triangle representing a prism sitting inside an aquarium. The bottom side is the unequal side of the triangle. On the left side of the triangle, a ray of light is shown to be incident on the prism. The light passes into the prism and the one arrow representing the incident beam splits into four diverging arrows representing different colors. The top arrow represents red and the bottom arrow represents violet. The four arrows pass out of the prism on the right and are spreading out even more after they leave the prism.\" src=\"/images/bedecc7925a66f64710b3d0739bd79c8.png\"></p><p>A beam of white light is incident on a triangular glass prism with an index of refraction of about 1.5 for visible light, producing a spectrum. Initially, the prism is in a glass aquarium filled with air, as shown above. If the aquarium is filled with water with an index of refraction of 1.3, which of the following is true?</p>",
