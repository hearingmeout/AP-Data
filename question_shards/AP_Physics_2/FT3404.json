Four points are shown on the graph, representing the vertices of a dashed rectangle shown. Point 1 has y value p sub 1 and x value V sub 1. It is labelled T sub 1 and is the upper left hand corner of the rectangle. Point 2 has y value p sub 1 and an x value greater than V sub 1. It is labelled T sub 2 and is the upper right hand corner of the rectangle. Point 3 has a y value less than p sub 1 and the same x value as point 2. It is labelled T sub 3 and is the lower right hand corner of the rectangle. Point 4 has the same y value as point 3 and x value V sub 1. It is labelled T sub 4 and is the lower left hand corner of the rectangle. A solid line is shown connecting points 1 and 3.
