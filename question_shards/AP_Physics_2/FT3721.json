Six evenly spaced tick marks are shown on the y- axis. The radius R of the spherical shell is marked on the x-axis. The graph plots a dashed horizontal line, at the third tick mark along the x-axis indicating zero electric field strength, from a distance of zero to a distance R. Beginning at the distance R, at the third tick mark and adjacent to the horizontal line above the x-axis, the graph changes. From this point, the curve is shown concave up decreasing with increasing distance. This part of thegraph is concave up decreasing, appearing to have a horizontal asymptote at the x-axis.\" height=\"148\" src=\"/images/2984a2a2fcd31363b9c192946c0a0a47.png\" width=\"165\"></p>\n\n<p>A conducting spherical shell of radius <em>R</em> has charge <em>q</em> uniformly distributed on its outer surface.
