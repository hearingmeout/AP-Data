    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows an energy level diagram. Three horizontal lines are shown indicating the energy levels 1, 2, and 3. Each line is labeled with a value n on the left hand side of each horizontal line and a value of energy in electron volts on the right hand side of each line. The bottom line is labelled n equals 1 and energy equals 0 electron volts. The middle line is labelled n equals 2 and energy equals 10.2 electron volts. The top line is labelled n equals 3 and energy equals 12.1 electron volts. The middle line is one millimeter from the top line and 4 millimeters from the bottom line. A vertical arrow pointing from the middle line to the bottom line is labelled I. A vertical arrow pointing from the top line to the bottom line is labelled II. A vertical arrow pointing from the top line to the middle line is labelled III. \" maxwidth=\"200\" src=\"/images/ec8d2c919cb244d878db8c5da2f1d234.png\" width=\"200\"></p><p>The figure above shows a portion of the energy level diagram for hydrogen.
