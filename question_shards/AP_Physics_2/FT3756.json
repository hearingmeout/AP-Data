Region 1 is after the light leaves the laser but before it passes through the first lens, and the light rays in this region are parallel.Region 2 is between the two lenses. When the light rays pass into region 2, they converge to a point to the right of the first lens that is closer to the first lens than to the second lens and then diverge from that point. Region 3 is to the right of the second lens, and the light rays are horizontal and parallel again in this region.
