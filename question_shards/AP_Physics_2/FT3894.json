The lines between the spheres begin at sphere Y and end on sphere Z, as indicated by arrows on the field lines. The field lines above a horizontal line connecting the two spheres are concave down, and the field lines below the same line are concave down. The field lines to the left of sphere Y point radially out from the sphere, and the field lines to the right of sphere Z point radially in towards the sphere.
