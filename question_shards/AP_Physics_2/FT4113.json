    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows two parallel plates, one above the other. The top plate has a negative charge, and the bottom plate has a positive charge. On the right edge of the plates, a small dot is halfway between the plates. A directional arrow slightly below and to the left of the dot is pointing to the left and is labeled v sub 0. There is a dotted horizontal line that starts to the right of the dot and continues to the left and touches the dot. Four dotted paths are shown to the left of the dot and between the plates. Path A starts at the dot and is a straight line up and to the left at about a 45 degree angle above the horizontal. Path B is toward the left and curves gradually upward. Path C is a straight horizontal line to the left. Path D is to the left and curves downward. The curve of D is about twice as sharp as the curve of B.  \" height=\"123\" src=\"/images/6f4d82171598001bc9a205f218df749a.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n\n<p>A proton is traveling to the left when it enters the space between two oppositely charged parallel plates, as shown above.
