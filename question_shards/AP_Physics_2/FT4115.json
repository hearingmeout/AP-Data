    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a three-dimensional graph with axes labels x, y, and z. Two graphs are shown in the figure. A graph labeled E is a sine curve in the x-y plane. A graph labeled B is a sine curve in the x-z plane. Both graphs show the sine curve pattern twice, and both graphs cross the x-axis at the same points. Arrows are drawn from the x-axis to the graphs indicating that the E graph starts in the positive y direction and the B graph starts in the positive z direction. These arrows change size as the height of each sine curve changes and change direction when the sine curve goes from positive to negative values.\" height=\"152\" src=\"/images/cc615402381db9c6d7c08f74606fff8d.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows a model of an electromagnetic wave, where <em>E </em>is the electric field and <em>B </em>is the magnetic field.
