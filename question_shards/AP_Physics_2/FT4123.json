The spacing is such that the width of Glass is less than than the width of Water or of Air. An arrow beginning on the left side of the water approximately one-quarter of the way down from the top, travels in a straight line down and to the right and reaches the vertical line at the surface between the water and the glass. The arrow travels through the glass in a straight line down and to the right at an angle closer to the horizontal than the path it took through the water. The arrow reaches the vertical line at the surface between the glass and the air. The arrow travels through the air in a straight line down and to the right at an angle farther from the horizontal than the path it took through the water. The arrow reaches the vertical line at the right side of the air.  The beginning of the arrow in water is labeled X, and the ending of the arrow in air is labeled Y. \" maxwidth=\"200\" src=\"/images/39ec140a9af0c3fa003e181ae5d6063f.png\" width=\"200\"></p><p>A light ray enters a layer of water at point <em>X</em>, passes through a layer of glass, and exits through a layer of air at point <em>Y</em>, as shown in the figure above.
