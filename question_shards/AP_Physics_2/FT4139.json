The horizontal axis is labeled Current, in units of amperes, and every fifth gird line is numbered. The vertical axis is labeled Power, in units of watts. The numbers appearing on the horizontal axis are zero, zero point 5, 1, and 1 point 5. The numbers appearing on the vertical axis are zero, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. A straight line starts at coordinate zero, zero and goes up to approximately coordinate one point six two, ten. The following data points are shown, and their relationship to the line is noted: ampere, zero point one five; watts, zero point 9; on the line ampere, zero point three three; watts, one point nine; slightly below the line ampere, zero point six; watts, 4; slightly above the line ampere, zero point seven five; watts, 5 point 2; a little above the line ampere, 1; watts, 4 point 9; a little below the line ampere, 1 point 6; watts, nine point nine; just slightly above the line \" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/b81dfdab25ba05f344e4bacadb01510f.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p>A variable resistor is connected to a battery of unknown potential difference.
