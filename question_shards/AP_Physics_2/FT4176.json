The resistor on top of the circuit is labeled X, the resistor in the middle is labeled Y, and the resistor on bottom of the circuit is labeled Z. Resistors X and Z appear to have the same length. Resistor Y appears to be half as long as the other two resistors. Resistors X and Y appear to have the same diameter. Resistor Z appears to be half the diameter of the other two resistors.  \" height=\"125\" src=\"/images/e390e54d67b3ab001f8a9f4b1ba52e4f.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above represents a section of a circuit containing three resistors, <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, and <em>Z</em>, of different sizes but made of the same material.
