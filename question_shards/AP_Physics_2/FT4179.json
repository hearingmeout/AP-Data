    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure consists of a screen, an electron beam, and two wire coils from a top view. The horizontal screen is on top of the figure. The left side of the screen is labeled Left and the right side of the screen is labeled Right. The electron beam is a vertical dashed path from the bottom of the figure going up to the center of the screen and has an arrow pointing up toward the screen. The wire coil on the left of the electron beam has a vertical arrow pointing up and is labeled I.  The wire coil on the right of the electron beam has a vertical arrow pointing up and is labeled I.  To the right of the wire coils is the text Two Parallel Wire Coils. The two coils and the electron beam are parallel to each other, and the beam goes through the middle of the two coils.  The figure consists of a screen, an electron beam, and a circle representing wire coils from a side view.  The vertical screen is on the left, the top of the screen is labeled Top, and the bottom of the screen is labeled Bottom. The electron beam is horizontal, has an arrow pointing left toward the screen, and intersects the Screen at its center.  The circle representing two wire coils is halfway along the electron beam and has a curved arrow pointing in a counterclockwise direction and is labeled I.  Below the two wire coils is the text Two Parallel Wire Coils.\" height=\"264\" src=\"/images/d55bca1d9931e80c2ccb93f71dd6f37d.png\" width=\"550\"></p>\n\n<p>A beam of electrons travels between two parallel wire coils, as shown in the figures above. When the coils carry no current, the electron beam is undeflected and hits the center of the screen, as indicated by the dashed line. When a constant current <em>I </em>in the indicated direction is created in the coils, the electron beam is deflected toward which edge of the screen?</p>\n",
