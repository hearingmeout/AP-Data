The left side of the line is labeled n sub air equals 1, and the right side of the line is labeled n sub plastic. A horizontal dashed line goes through the midpoint of the vertical solid line. An arrow on the left of the solid vertical line points down and to the right, and intersects the point where the vertical and horizontal lines meet, creating an angle of theta sub 1 with the horizontal line. Another arrow leaves the same point and points down and to the right, creating an angle of theta sub 2 with the horizontal line. The second arrow makes a smaller angle with the vertical dashed line than the first arrow does. \" height=\"461\" src=\"/images/b95bef04e50e3d9a3c1a72782c34143f.png\" width=\"200\"></p>\n\n<p>A student performs an experiment to determine the index of refraction of a plastic block. The student shines a laser beam from air (<em>n</em><sub>air</sub> = 1) into a piece of plastic (<em>n</em><sub>plastic</sub>) at an angle of incidence θ<sub>1</sub> and measures the angle of refraction θ<sub>2</sub>, as shown in Figure 1 above. Measurements are taken as θ<sub>1</sub> is increased. From the data the student produces the two graphs shown below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a gridded graph in the first quadrant and data points. The graph is titled Graph 1.
