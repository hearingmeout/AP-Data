The series combination of the switch labeled S and the resistor labeled R sub 2 are connected in parallel to the capacitor labeled C.  This parallel combination is connected in series to the resistor labeled R sub 1 and the battery.  \" src=\"/images/489be4693629f04b38cfad5fee726ba4.png\"></p><p>In the circuit represented above, two resistors (<em>R</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>), a capacitor <em>C, </em>and an open switch <em>S </em>are connected to a battery. The circuit reaches equilibrium. The switch is then closed, and the circuit is allowed to come to a new equilibrium. Which of the following is a true statement about the energy stored in the capacitor after the switch is closed compared with the energy stored in the capacitor before the switch is closed?</p>",
