The object is between the plates, centered horizontally and above the vertical center. A dashed arrow begins from the object, points horizontally right and is labeled A. A second dashed arrow begins from the object, curves down and to the right, and is labeled B. A third dashed arrow begins from the object, points at a 45 degree angle down and to the right in a  straight line from the object and is labeled C. A fourth dashed arrow begins from the object, points vertically straight down, and is labeled D.
