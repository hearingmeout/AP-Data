The horizontal axis is labeled A, the vertical axis is labeled q, and the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled O. A best-fit curve travels from the topmost data point near the top of the vertical axis and curves in a hyperbolic shape down and to the right evenly bisecting the data points. The data points do not touch the axes. \" height=\"129\" src=\"/images/b0225486d9a1dd29168bff28a999263d.png\" width=\"180\"></p>\n\n<p>Students are performing an experiment to determine how changing the area of the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor affects its behavior in a circuit. They connect a capacitor with plate area <em>A</em> to a battery and allow it to become fully charged. They take measurements that they believe will allow them to calculate the charge <em>q</em> on one plate of the capacitor. The students then repeat the procedure with other capacitors. The capacitors each have a different plate area but are otherwise identical. The students plot the calculated charge <em>q</em> as a function of plate area <em>A</em>. Their results, including a best fit to the data, are represented above. Is this graph a reasonably accurate representation of the relationship between <em>q</em> and <em>A</em>?</p>\n",
