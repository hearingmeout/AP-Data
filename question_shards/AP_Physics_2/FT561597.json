The lower of the two curves starts at the origin and curves gently up and to the right, and ends just past 4 volts and just below 0.7amperes. The higher of the two curves starts at the origin and curves up and to the right, and is always above the lower curve.

If the two lamps are connected in parallel to a 3.0 V battery, what is the total current supplied by the battery?</p>\n",
