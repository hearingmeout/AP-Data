The thermal conductivity of the top bar is 200 W/ m <strong>⋅</strong> K, and that of the bottom bar is 400 W/ m <strong>⋅</strong> K . If the net energy transferred through the top bar in a given time interval is Q, what is the net energy transferred through the bottom bar during the same time interval?</p>\n",
