There is a point labeled X toward the top left of the graph and three lines that form a quarter circle.  From point X, a line labeled 1 moves horizontally to the right.  The line turns and moves directly down.  This vertical line is labeled 2.  Then the line curves up to X. This curved line is labeled 3. There are 3 arrows on the graph. One is on the line labeled 1 pointing to the right, the second is on the vertical line labeled 2 pointing down, and the third is on the curve labeled 3 pointing up and to the left.\" height=\"173\" src=\"/images/a7b058780c41e46925e9f23d963d5d54.png\" width=\"290\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows pressure as a function of volume for a sample of an ideal gas. The gas has an internal energy of 1000 J at state X and is taken through the cycle shown. Process 3 is isothermal. The work that the gas does on the environment is 400 J during process 1 and 250 J during one complete cycle. What is the net thermal energy transferred into the gas during one complete cycle?</p>\n",
