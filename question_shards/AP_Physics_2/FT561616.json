A student moves the candle to several positions relative to the lens and then adjusts the position of the screen until an image is formed. Each time, the student records the distance d from the candle to the lens and the distance s from the lens to the screen. Which of the following procedures will allow the student to determine the focal length of the lens?</p>\n",
