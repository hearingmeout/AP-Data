There are two curves on the graph.  One curve is labeled Initial. This curve starts at the origin, moves right and curves up steeply to a high point, and then curves almost as steeply down, briefly becoming less steep before it ends on the horizontal axis. The other curve is labeled Final and also starts at the origin and moves right, but it curves up less steeply to a high point that is located to the right of and below the high point of the initial curve. The Final curve then curves down toward the horizontal axis, and ends on the horizontal axis to the right of the Initial curve.\" height=\"217\" src=\"/images/da53f64990575aad2137ba1ce41aa715.png\" width=\"375\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the initial and final molecular speed distributions of a gas as a result of a thermodynamic process.
