There is also a point labeled P that is outside the square to the right of and slightly above the square’s lower right corner.\" height=\"155\" src=\"/images/c9678b4b53792358f216ada3f08c4622.png\" width=\"305\"></p>\n\n<p>An electron is moving to the right, as shown in the figure above. It passes through the shaded region, which contains a magnetic field. The electron travels along a path that takes it through point P. The gravitational force on the electron is negligible. What is the direction of the magnetic field?</p>\n",
