The horizontal axis is labeled “Position, in micrometers,” and the numbers 1 through 6 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Electric Field, in newtons per coulomb,” and the numbers negative 2 through 2 are indicated. The graph has 2 vertical peaks that reach 1 at approximately positions 0 point 8 and 4 point 2, and 2 vertical troughs that reach negative 1 at approximately positions 2 point 5 and 5 point 7. In the upper right, the figure presents a gridded graph, titled “Wave 2,” in the first and fourth quadrants of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “Position, in micrometers,” and the numbers 1 through 6 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Electric Field, in newtons per coulomb,” and the numbers negative 2 through 2 are indicated. The graph has 1 vertical peak that reaches approximately 1 point 2 at approximately position 1 point 5, and 1 vertical trough that reaches negative 1 point 2 at approximately position 4 point 5. In the bottom left, the figure presents a gridded graph, titled “Wave 3,” in the first and fourth quadrants of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “Position, in micrometers,” and the numbers 1 through 6 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Electric Field, in newtons per coulomb,” and the numbers negative 2 through 2 are indicated.
