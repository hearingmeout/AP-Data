    "prompt": "<p>When two bowling balls are held with their centers 30 centimeters apart, they exert a gravitational force of magnitude F on each other. For two free protons to exert a net force of magnitude F on each other, the protons must be separated by a distance of approximately 1 × 10<sup>-10</sup>m. Under these conditions, will the protons attract or repel each other, and why? </p>",
