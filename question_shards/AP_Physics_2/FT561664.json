There is a rightward pointing arrow drawn next to the pulse. The graph then continues horizontally to the right along the x axis, until it rises to form the second pulse. This pulse extends from just above x equals 20 to just below x equals 25, with its peak at approximately x equals 22 point 5 and y equals 1.

The pulse traveling to the right is half the height and twice the width of the pulse traveling to the left. Which of the following best represents the resulting shape when the peaks of the two pulses are at the same location?</p>",
