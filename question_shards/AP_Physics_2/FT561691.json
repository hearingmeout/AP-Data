The bottom side of the circuit has a resistor labeled capital R and the current is labeled 2 point 0 amps and is flowing leftward. The second circuit, labeled &quot;Figure 2,&quot; has 2 batteries and 3 resistors. The top side of the circuit has, from left to right, a 6 point 0 volt battery, a resistor labeled lowercase r, another 6 point 0 volt battery, and another resistor labeled lowercase r. There is a box made of dashed lines drawn around the first 6 point 0 volt battery and resistor lowercase r, and then another box made of dashed lines drawn around the next 6 point 0 volt battery and resistor lowercase r. The bottom side of the circuit has a resistor labeled capital R and the current is labeled 3 point 0 amps and is flowing leftward. \" height=\"168\" src=\"/images/a86290f87d0421e0b067a3aa1993b4ac.png\" width=\"340\"></p>\n\n<p>A battery with emf 6.0 V and an internal resistance <em>r</em> is connected to a resistor of resistance <em>R</em>, as shown in Figure 1 above.
