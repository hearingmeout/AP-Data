The horizontal axis is labeled &quot;Speed of Molecules, in meters per second,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 1,600, in increments of 200, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Number of Molecules,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 250,000, in increments of 50,000, are indicated. The first curve begins at 0 molecules and 0 meters per second, and moves steeply upward and to the right until it reaches approximately 210,000 molecules at 400 meters per second. It then moves steeply downward and to the right, until it reaches essentially 0 molecules at 1,150 meters per second. The second curve begins at 0 molecules and 0 meters per second, and moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches approximately 45,000 molecules at 750 meters per second. It then moves gradually downward and to the right, until it ends at approximately 10,000 molecules at 1,600 meters per second. \" height=\"298\" src=\"/images/33c319aef57ad864ec5919f8a56aa6af.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p>Two samples of the same type of gas molecules are placed in different closed containers and are thermally isolated from each other and the environment. The figure above shows the distribution of speeds for the molecules in each of the samples. The two samples are now mixed together and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium.
