The top of the circuit has a resistor labeled R sub 1. Next to this resistor, the circuit has 2 horizontal branches. The top branch has an open switch labeled S, and a resistor labeled R sub 2. The bottom branch has a capacitor labeled C. \" height=\"122\" src=\"/images/e7c5f57520174f24d576a8f2d39ceda9.png\" width=\"212\"></p>\n\n<p>In the circuit represented above, resistors <em>R<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>R<sub>2</sub></em>, capacitor <em>C</em>, and open switch <em>S</em> are connected to a battery. The circuit reaches equilibrium. The switch is then closed, and the circuit is allowed to come to a new equilibrium. Which of the following is a true statement about the charge <em>q<sub>f</sub></em> stored on the capacitor after the switch is closed compared with the charge <em>q<sub>i</sub></em> stored on the capacitor before the switch is closed?</p>\n",
