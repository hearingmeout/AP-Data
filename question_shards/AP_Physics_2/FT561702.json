    "prompt": "<p>An engineer has four wires made of the same material and wants to determine the material’s resistivity. The engineer measures the length <em>L</em> and cross-sectional area <em>A</em> of each wire. The engineer then applies a potential difference <em>V</em> across each wire and measures the resulting current <em>I</em>. To estimate the resistivity of the material using only the slope of a graph of the data, which of the following should be graphed as a function of <em>L/A</em>?</p>",
