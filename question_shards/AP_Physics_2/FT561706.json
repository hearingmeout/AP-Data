The lens is in a vertical position and a solid horizontal line goes through the center of the lens. A dashed vertical line goes through the center of the lens. On the horizontal line are three tick marks, one to the right of the lens and two to the left. The tick marks and the center of the lens are equally spaced. The tick mark on the right of the lens is labeled f. The first tick mark to the left of the lens is labeled f and the second is labeled 2f. There are two points on the horizontal line to the left of the lens. Point A, is near the left end of the horizontal line, to the left of 2 f. Point B is midway between the tick mark labeled f and the lens. An arrow starts at point A, and points vertically up. \" height=\"186\" src=\"/images/36df2904e7673b17d242a7b51578c0ac.png\" width=\"340\"></p>\n\n<p>In the figure above, an object is moved from position A to position B.
