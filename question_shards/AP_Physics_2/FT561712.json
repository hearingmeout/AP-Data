    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"A diagram and a graph. The diagram shows a rectangular piece of cardboard with a long slit in the center, along its length. A horizontal string is passed through the slit. The string is labeled as student 1 and student 2 on either side, respectively. A dashed vertical is drawn perpendicular to the string. The angle of rotation of the slit is labeled “Theta.” The graph plots Angle from Vertical in degrees on the horizontal axis, from 0 to 360 in increments of 90. The vertical axis plots Amplitude in meters, from 0 to 0.35 in increments of 0.05. The graph plots a sine curve that has maximums and minimums in the following points: (0, 0.025), (90, 0.325), (180, 0.025), (270, 0.325), (360, 0.025). All values are estimates.\" height=\"399\" src=\"/images/d72ae0dcb2f5dca36f32d51c2a98bc93.png\" width=\"370\"></p>\n\n<p>Student 1 and student 2 pull on opposite ends of a horizontal string that passes through a long, thin slit in a piece of cardboard, as shown in the top figure above. The plane of the cardboard is kept vertical, and the slit can be rotated so its angle <em>Ɵ</em> relative to the dashed vertical line changes. Student 1 shakes the string, creating a transverse periodic wave of constant amplitude. At his end of the string, student 2 measures the amplitude of the wave that comes through the slit as a function of the angle of the slit relative to vertical. Student 2’s data is shown in the graph. In what direction is student 1 shaking the string?</p>\n",
