The horizontal axis is labeled Temperature, in Kelvin, and has two equally spaced tick marks that are from left to right, labeled 50 and 100. The vertical axis is labeled Pressure, open parenthesis times 10 raised to the power of 5 pascals close parenthesis, and has two equally spaced tick marks that are from bottom to top, labeled one and 2. The intersection of the axes is labeled O. The data points begin on the lower left, between O and the horizontal tick mark labeled 50, at approximately one third of the way from O to the tick mark, and between O and the vertical tick mark labeled one, at approximately one third of the way from O to the tick mark. The data points have slight variances but follow the general trend of a straight line up and to the right, and end at the tick mark labeled 100 on the horizontal axis and the tick mark labeled 2 on the vertical axis. \" height=\"220\" src=\"/images/d36978f78fea2ad89af7e7418f82baae.png\" width=\"320\"></p>\n\n<p>A sample of gas is in a container of fixed volume. The pressure of the gas is measured as its absolute temperature is increased. A graph of pressure measurements as a function of temperature is shown above. According to the ideal gas law, which of the following will be true if the container volume is reduced to half the original value and the experiment is repeated?</p>\n",
