      {
        "label": "<em>T</em><sub>2</sub> is less, because the electric potential energy added by the field to separate the ions is gone once the field is turned off.",

        "label": "<em>T</em><sub>2</sub> is less, because pairs of positive and negative ions bond to become molecules once the field is turned off, and energy is required to create the bonds.",

        "label": "<em>T</em><sub>2</sub> is greater, because work is done on the ions in the process of turning off the field.",

        "label": "<em>T</em><sub>2</sub> is greater, because the electric potential energy of the separated ions is converted to kinetic energy as they mix and collide.",
