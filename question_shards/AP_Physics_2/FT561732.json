    "prompt": "A hydrogen atom is isolated in a vacuum chamber. The electron is now separated from the proton and moved to a distance 1 cm away. Let <em>F<sub>G</sub></em> be the magnitude of the gravitational force between the proton and electron, and let <em>F<sub>E</sub></em> be the magnitude of the electric force between the proton and electron. How does the ratio F<sub>G</sub> /F<sub>E</sub> change as the particles are separated?",
