The vertical axis is labeled y, in units of meters, and there are two equally spaced tick marks labeled from bottom to top, zero point one zero and zero point two zero. The intersection of the axes is labeled O. There are 3 labeled points on the graph as follows: The point with charge positive two point zero microcoulombs is at coordinates zero comma zero. The point with charge positive four point zero microcoulombs is at coordinates zero comma zero point two zero. The point with charge negative five point zero microcoulombs is at coordinates zero point three zero comma zero. \" height=\"194\" src=\"/images/2e79955f19165a60accee9e502dbcbc0.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows the locations and charges of three objects.
