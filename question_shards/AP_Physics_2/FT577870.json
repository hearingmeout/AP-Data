The horizontal axis is labeled “Object Distance, in centimeters,” and the numbers 5 through 35, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Image Distance, in centimeters,” and the numbers 20 through 120, in increments of 20, are indicated. There are 20 data points plotted along the curve. The curve begins at the point with approximate coordinates 11 comma 110 and moves steeply downward and slightly to the right until it reaches the point with approximate coordinates 14 comma 38. The curve then begins to gradually level off and passes through the point with coordinates 20 comma 20, and ends at the point with approximate coordinates 30 comma 18.\" height=\"247\" src=\"/images/da36396c488a0b37e35aea6e5f2bffb3.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>Some students collect data to determine the focal length of a concave mirror. Using a small candle as the object, they move a piece of white cardboard until they see a focused image of the candle flame on it. The students measure the distances of the candle and the image from the mirror. A graph of the data is shown above. Which of the following is closest to the focal length of the mirror?</p>\n",
