    "prompt": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img alt=\"The figure presents a circuit with a battery, a closed switch, two resistors, and a capacitor. The left side of the circuit has a battery labeled script e. Moving up the left side and across the top of the circuit, there is a closed switch labeled S and a resistor labeled R sub 1. To the right of the resistor, the circuit splits into two vertical branches. The first branch has a resistor labeled R sub 2, and the second branch has a capacitor labeled C. \" height=\"98\" src=\"/images/98359c0ede3716d7ddf34c742d273eff.png\" width=\"250\">\n<p>The circuit shown above includes a battery, two resistors, and a capacitor with values as labeled. The current through the battery is I. Which of the following is a correct equation for potential differences in the circuit a long time after the switch is closed?</p>\n",
