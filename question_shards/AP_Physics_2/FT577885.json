    "prompt": "<p>Student 1 brings a negatively charged rod with an insulating handle near to but not touching an uncharged metal sphere and finds that the objects attract. She wants the sphere to be repelled by the rod. Student 2, who is uncharged, suggests that this can be accomplished if he touches the sphere. Which of the following indicates whether this will work, and if so, gives a procedure that will cause the repulsion?</p>",
