A lens is located at the middle of the dashed line, with the line through the center of the lens.&nbsp; To the left of the lens, a thick upward pointing arrow, labeled “object,” is drawn, such that the bottom of the arrow touches the line. An unlabeled dot is drawn on the line, a little to the left of this arrow. To the right of the lens, a thick downward pointing arrow, labeled “image,” is drawn on the line, such that the bottom of the arrow is on the line. There are two rays drawn between the object and the image.&nbsp; One ray starts at the tip of the object, moves horizontally to the right, bends in the lens, then moves downward and to the right, until it hits the tip of the image. The second ray starts at the tip of the object, moves downward and to the right, straight through the midpoint of the lens and to the tip of the image.\" height=\"196\" src=\"/images/3b554fbab8b0d7ec7d9d000337e1fafc.png\" width=\"450\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows a ray diagram for an object near a lens. How will the height of the image change if the object is moved to the left toward the position of the dot?</p>\n",
