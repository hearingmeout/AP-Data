The other branch contains a resistor along the top, another resistor along the right, and a current labeled 1.7 amps along the bottom.\" height=\"122\" src=\"/images/84fc8c70c68bbb5888f9d0ad15e6eabe.png\" width=\"120\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student connects the circuit shown above and measures the values shown for three currents.
