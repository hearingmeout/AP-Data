In the circuit diagram, a battery is along the left. Moving up and to the right, there is an ammeter. Moving down the left there is a light bulb with a voltmeter across it. Along the bottom is a resistor.&nbsp; In the scatterplot, there are 9 points indicated. The origin is labeled O. The horizontal axis is labeled Potential Difference, in volts, and the numbers 1 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Current, in amperes, and the numbers 0.5 through 2.5, in increments of 0.5, are indicated. The 9 points are listed as follows. Note that all values are approximate.&nbsp; Point 1. 0.05 volts, 0.15 amperes. Point 2. 0.1 volts, 0.3 amperes. Point 3. 0.5 volts, 0.9 amperes. Point 4. 1 volt, 1.1 amperes.
