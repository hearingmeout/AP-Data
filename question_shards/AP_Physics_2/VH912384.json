In the circuit diagram, a battery is connected in series with a resistor, a circuit component, and an ammeter. In the scatterplot, there are 5 points indicated, with the origin labeled O. The horizontal axis is labeled Number of Resistors, and the numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Current, in amperes, and the numbers 0.2 through 1.8, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The 5 points are listed as follows. Note that all values are approximate.  Point 1. 1 resistor, 1.75 amperes. Point 2. 2 resistors, 1.0 ampere. Point 3. 3 resistors, 0.7 amperes. Point 4. 4 resistors, 0.58 amperes.

In addition to the component, the student has a battery of known <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"e m f\"><math alttext=\"e m f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>e</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, an ammeter, and five identical resistors, and connects the circuit shown above. The box represents the component. The student starts with one resistor in the circuit, then adds one resistor at a time in series, recording the current in the circuit each time. The graph shows the student’s data. The student then does a best-fit curve to the data. How can the curve be used to determine the resistance of the component?</p>\n",
