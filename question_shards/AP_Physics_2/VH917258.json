A beam of positively charged particles, one of which is shown above, initially moves to the right with speed <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"v\"><math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, above and parallel to the wire. The current in the wire is turned on and is directed toward the left. Four labeled detectors are arranged as shown in the diagram and can detect the particles.
