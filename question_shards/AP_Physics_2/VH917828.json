      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No. Because the loop is not magnetized, it will not be affected by the magnet.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No. Because the loop is not moving, there are no forces on it.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes. Because the magnetic field due to current in the loop exerts a force on the magnet, the magnet also exerts a force on the loop.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes. Because gravity acts on the loop, the magnet must exert a force on the loop to keep it at rest.</p>",
