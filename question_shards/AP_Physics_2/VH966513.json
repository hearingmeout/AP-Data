    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student is performing an experiment that involves the charge on a metal cup that is attached to an uncharged electroscope. A charged rod is lowered into the cup without touching the sides of the cup. As a result the leaves of the electroscope separate. The rod is then removed from the cup, and the leaves return to their unseparated position. The student repeats the procedure, but this time the electroscope is grounded and the ground is removed before the rod is removed from the cup. The leaves then remain separated. What can be concluded about the charge on the separated leaves of the electroscope?</p>\n",
