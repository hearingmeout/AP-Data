The horizontal axis is labeled “1 over s sub i, in meters raised to the negative 1 power,” and the numbers 0 through 0.20, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “1 over s sub 0, in meters raised to the negative 1 power,” and the values 0 through 0.25, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. &nbsp;A line of best fit is drawn, and begins approximately at the coordinate 0.025 comma 0.21. It moves downward and to the right, and ends approximately at the coordinate 0.16 comma 0.075. There are 6 data points on the graph, which all touch the line of best fit. Two data points touch the line from below, and four data points touch the line from above. Three data points are spaced out around the top half of the line, and three data points are clustered around the bottom half of the line.\" height=\"290\" src=\"/images/d6d51741e1e06a9709e079f8d6f4a109.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student places the object at various locations to the left of the lens and moves the screen to observe focused images.
