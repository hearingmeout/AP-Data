In seeking to determine the charge on the sphere, the student brings a positively charged rod near the sphere and finds that the sphere is attracted to the rod. The student then brings a negatively charged rod near the sphere and finds that the sphere is repelled by the rod. Which of the following conclusions, if any, can be drawn from the results?</p>\n",
