    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Students are asked to design an experiment to confirm that the pressure and volume of an ideal gas are inversely proportional. They use a cylinder containing an ideal gas that has a plunger equipped with a pressure sensor. They perform several trials, and in each trial they start with the gas at the same initial pressure and volume. The students then quickly push the plunger so that the gas achieves a different final pressure and volume. After analyzing their results, they determine that the final pressures and volumes do not follow an inversely proportional relationship. Which of the following refinements to the procedure would show the inverse proportionality between pressure and volume?</p>\n",
