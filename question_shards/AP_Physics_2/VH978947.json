      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The volume of the gas decreases, so the gas molecules hit the walls of the flask more often. This increases the pressure and thus the average force exerted on the gas molecules. The speed of the gas molecules increases, which means greater kinetic energy, and thus an increase in the temperature.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The volume of the gas decreases, so the pressure inside the flask increases. The gas molecules slow down due to the increased pressure, which means their kinetic energy increases. Collisions of molecules with the walls involve less force. As a result, temperature decreases.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The volume of the gas decreases. The pressure inside the flask increases and so does the temperature. As a result the molecules hit the walls with a greater force and thus exert a larger pressure. The gas reaches instant equilibrium with the surroundings.</p>",
