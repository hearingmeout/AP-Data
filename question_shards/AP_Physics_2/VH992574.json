The director of the movie wants to depict how people in a spaceship that is speeding away from the planet would perceive the explosion. Which of the following best explains what the people should perceive?</p>\n",

      {

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light should be perceived but the sound should not, because light is an electromagnetic wave while sound is a mechanical wave.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light and sound should be perceived simultaneously, because light and sound travel the same distance from the explosion to the spaceship.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light should be perceived before the sound, because light propagates faster than sound.</p>",
