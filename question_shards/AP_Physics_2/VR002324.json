The other end of the spring is attached to a metal ring, as shown, that can slide freely along a vertical rod. The student creates one wave on the spring, and the ring moves up and down the rod. The student creates a second wave, and the ring does not move. Which of the following can be concluded about the two waves and their polarizations?</p>\n",
