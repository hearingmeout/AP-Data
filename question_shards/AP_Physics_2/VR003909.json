Electrons emitted from the metal move across a vacuum to a collector plate, as shown in the diagram. As the potential difference of the power supply increases, the number of electrons detected by the ammeter decreases. The potential difference is increased until it reaches <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"V sub s\"><math alttext=\"V sub s\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, at which no electrons reach the collector plate.
