    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A beam of electrons, all with the same speed, is incident on a crystal whose atoms are at a fixed spacing. The electrons then strike a detection screen, resulting in a diffraction pattern with alternating areas of minimum/maximum intensity similar to a double slit interference pattern. If the potential difference used to accelerate the electrons is increased, which of the following predictions is correct about the spacing between the maxima change?</p>\n",
