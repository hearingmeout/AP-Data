The plates are connected to a battery labeled Variable Power Supply. There is an ammeter labeled A between the power supply and the metal plate. &nbsp;\" height=\"176\" src=\"/images/bc9b79391396fff5f392edc230b01851.png\" width=\"315\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows a sketch of a photoelectric-effect experiment. Light incident on a metal ejects electrons from the metal’s surface with a range of energies. The electrons hit the plate and a current is created in the circuit. The variable power supply is used to create a potential difference between the metal and the plate. There is a potential difference for which no electrons reach the plate and the current goes to zero. Which of the following justifies the use of this potential difference to determine the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons?</p>\n",
