Two points, X and Y, are also indicated. Starting on the left vertical branch there is a battery. At the point where the left vertical branch and top horizontal branch meet is a point labeled X. On the top horizontal branch there is a resistor labeled R. On the right vertical branch there is a capacitor. At the point where the right vertical branch and bottom horizontal branch meet is a point labeled Y. On the bottom horizontal branch there is an open switch on the left side of the branch.
