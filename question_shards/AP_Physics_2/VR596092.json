Which of the following statements correctly predicts and explains the results of this experiment?</p>\n",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will be detected a few seconds later because sound propagates at the same speed as light in the vacuum of space but slower than light in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will be detected much later because sound propagates much slower than light for the entire distance from the Moon to Earth.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will never be detected because sound waves cannot propagate in the vacuum of space between the Moon and Earth.</p>",
