    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Two samples of gas, one with two moles of helium gas and the other with two moles of xenon gas, are sealed in separate thermally conducting containers of the same volume. A xenon atom is more massive than a helium atom. The helium gas is heated until it has twice the temperature of the xenon gas. After this heating process, the two containers are placed in thermal contact, but isolated from their surroundings, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. Which of the following correctly indicates the direction of energy transfer between the gases, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n",
