    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A closed system consists of two identical metal blocks at different temperatures. Initially, one block has a temperature twice that of the other. The blocks are placed in thermal contact and isolated from their surroundings. A student claims that the entropy of the isolated system increases over time. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?</p>\n",

      {
