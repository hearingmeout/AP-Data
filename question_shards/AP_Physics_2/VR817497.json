In the first state, shown on the left, both the iron and aluminum bars have magnetic dipoles pointing randomly in different directions. In the second state, shown in the middle, the bars are in a magnetic field that is directed to the right, and both bars have magnetic dipoles that continue pointing randomly in different directions. In the third state, shown on the right, both bars have question marks in place of indicated magnetic dipoles.\" src=\"/images/bc2beecf4a766cc499f3e7acbeb4bd93.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Bars of initially unmagnetized iron and unmagnetized aluminum are placed in a strong magnetic field directed to the right, as shown in the middle figure. Iron is ferromagnetic, while aluminum is paramagnetic. After leaving the two bars in the field for a long time, the field is removed.
