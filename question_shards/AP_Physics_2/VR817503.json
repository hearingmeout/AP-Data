Other magnetic field lines move away from the right end of the right bar and loop around both bars and run into the left end of the left bar.\" src=\"/images/60be309e7e176ad121a0176e220f060d.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Two identical bar magnets are brought close together. The magnetic field lines of the two magnets are shown in the figure. A student claims that the poles of the magnets are aligned north pole to north pole. Which of the following correctly states whether the student’s claim is correct and provides a correct justification?</p>\n",
