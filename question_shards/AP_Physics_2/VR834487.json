An insulating rod with a positive charge is held near the sphere. A student makes the following incorrect claim:</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">“Since the sphere is a solid conductor and has zero net charge, it must be electrically neutral everywhere throughout its interior as well as everywhere on its surface.”</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following explains why the student’s claim is incorrect?</p>\n",
