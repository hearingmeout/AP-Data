In each diagram two of the point charges have a charge of negative Q and one point charge has a charge of positive Q. The first diagram is labeled initial and shows the charges on an equilateral triangle facing down with side lengths of d. In it, the top left and top right point charges are negative, and the middle bottom point charge is positive. The second diagram is labeled Final and shows the three point charges in a horizontal line. In it, the positively charged point charge is in the middle and one negatively charged point charge is to the left and right, each a distance d over 2 from the middle point charge.\" src=\"/images/094d05e0b45bfe9f8d4b81ad1c6bc121.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Three point charges are initially arranged at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, as shown in the figure.
