The circuit diagram consists of a rectangular circuit that has additional branches connected to it at its top right, bottom right, and bottom left corners, and at a point along its bottom horizontal branch. The top horizontal branch has the battery. From top to bottom, the right vertical branch has a light bulb and switch B. From left to right, the bottom horizontal branch has a light bulb labeled Bulb X and switch A. An additional vertical branch is shown to the right of the right vertical branch on the rectangular circuit, and is connected to the top right and bottom right corners. From top to bottom, it has a light bulb and switch C. An additional horizontal branch is shown below the bottom horizontal branch on the rectangular circuit, so that it is connected to the bottom left and bottom right corners, and has two light bulbs. On this additional horizontal branch, another additional vertical branch is shown and&nbsp; has a light bulb . This vertical branch extends from a point between the additional horizontal branch’s two light bulbs and connects to the bottom horizontal branch on the rectangular circuit, between Bulb X and switch A.\" src=\"/images/3b1e68ca459c112c94b8e1722b291bb0.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A circuit consists of a battery, six identical light bulbs, and three switches labeled <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A\"><math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math></span></span>, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math></span></span>, and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C\"><math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">C</mi></math></span></span>, as shown in the figure.
