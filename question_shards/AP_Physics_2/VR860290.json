    "answer": "i3",
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Correct, because the average kinetic energy of the gas atoms decreases and the kinetic energy of every gas atom will decrease.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Correct, because the rate of collisions between the gas atoms and the container wall will decrease.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Incorrect, because the average kinetic energy of the gas atoms decreases but any individual atom’s energy may increase or decrease due to random processes.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Incorrect, because the average kinetic energy of the gas atoms will not change because the volume of the container is not changing.</p>",
