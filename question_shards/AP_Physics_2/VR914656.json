    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Four different periodic waves are produced on the same string, but at different times. Each of the following graphs represents, for one of the waves, the displacement <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"delta y\"><math alttext=\"delta y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>y</mi></math></span></span> as a function of time <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math></span></span> at the same location on the string. The graphs all use the same scale for both the displacement and the time. Which graph represents the wave that has the greatest period?</p>\n",
