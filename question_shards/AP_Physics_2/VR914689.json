Both ends of the string are in a fixed position at the same height as each other. The horizontal distance between the two ends of the string is labeled L. The string is represented by a solid curve. The wave is represented by a dashed curve. The string trends horizontally from left to the right in a wave-like pattern. It reaches a peak one eighth of the way along distance L, reaches a trough three eighths of the way along distance L, reaches a second peak five eighths of the way along distance L, and reaches a second trough seven eighths of the way along distance L. The wave begins where the string begins and trends horizontally from left to the right in a wave-like pattern. It reaches a trough one eighth of the way along distance L, reaches a peak three eighths of the way along distance L, reaches a second trough five eighths of the way along distance L, and reaches a second peak seven eighths of the way along distance L. The wave ends where the string ends.
