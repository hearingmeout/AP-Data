The first line segment begins at 0 units across and 2 units up, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at 2 units across and 2 units up. The second line segment begins where the first segment ends, and moves vertically upward until it ends at 2 units across and 5 units up. The third line segment begins where the second segment ends, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at 3 units across and 5 units up. The fourth line segment begins where the third segment ends, and moves vertically downward until it ends at 3 units across and 2 units up. The fifth line segment begins where the fourth segment ends, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at 5 units across and 2 units up. The String Displacement When Centers of Pulses X and Y Coincide grid consists of 5 line segments. The first line segment begins at 0 units across and 2 units up, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at 2 units across and 2 units up.
