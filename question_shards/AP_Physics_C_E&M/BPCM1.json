Structure of a portion of the cell membrane</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Figure 1. Structure diagram of a portion of the cell membrane. Region A and 2 surrounding membranes are shown between extracellular space and intracellular space. Region A consists of a type of phospholipid and modified membrane lipids. Cholesterol is located between some of the phospholipids. Each modified membrane lipid has a strand of sugars on the extracellular space side. One of these strands of sugars is attached to Protein C in the extracellular space. Between Region A and one of the surrounding membranes is Protein B. Protein B spans the width of the membrane. It has strands of sugars attached to it in the extracellular space. Both surrounding membranes are made up of a different type of phospholipid than Region A. The surrounding membrane next to Protein B has another protein, Protein A. Protein A spans the width of the membrane. The other surrounding membrane has no additional components. \" class=\"lrn-image-center\" height=\"407\" src=\"/images/67a8181e2982c96f788f8b0908f8bf56.jpg\" width=\"400\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following best describes the chemical composition of the different types of macromolecules that make up the membrane represented in Figure 1?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"></span></span></span></span></p>\n",
