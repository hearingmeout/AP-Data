A researcher is investigating how blasticidin S&nbsp;enters mammalian cells. The researcher identified two proteins that might be associated with blasticidin S&nbsp;transport into the cell.</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following claims most likely explains how the two proteins are directly involved in the antibiotic’s ability to enter the cell?</p>\n",
