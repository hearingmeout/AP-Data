    "prompt": "<p>A researcher created an experimental chamber that allowed a population of fruit flies to mate randomly, but where female flies had to choose one of three side-chambers in which to lay eggs. All three side-chambers were the same except for the added scent of apple in side-chamber A, banana in side-chamber B, and cucumber in side-chamber C. Only eggs deposited in side-chamber C were allowed to hatch and produce offspring. Adult flies did not know which side-chamber was producing offspring. Every day for 100 days, the researcher counted the number of flies in each side-chamber. By day 100, the number of flies in side-chamber C greatly increased, while the number of flies in side-chambers A and B had greatly decreased.</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following statements best explains why there were more flies in side-chamber C, than in side-chambers A or B, on day 100?</p>\n",
