    "prompt": "<p>A student created a terrarium by placing soil in the bottom of a large glass container. He added several species of mosses and tiny grasses to the soil. The student ensured that the soil and plants were damp by adding water from a nearby creek. He added a few dead, decaying leaves and twigs, some small insects, and a few small garden slugs to the terrarium. He placed an airtight seal on the container and placed the container near a window where it would receive some sunlight but would not overheat. After three years, the terrarium still contains living organisms.</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following statements best explains how this terrarium could sustain living organisms for three years?</p>\n",
