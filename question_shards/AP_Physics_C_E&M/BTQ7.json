Components of a cell membrane</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Diagram of a cell membrane composed of a phospholipid bilayer. The phospholipid bilayer is composed of 2 rows of phospholipids. Each phospholipid has a head and a tail. In each layer, phospholipid heads are oriented to the exterior of the membrane, resulting in a hydrophilic region at the outside edges of the membrane. The phospholipid tails are oriented to the membrane’s interior, resulting in a hydrophobic region inside the membrane. 4 other components are also shown. A channel protein passes through the entire bilayer. An embedded protein and a glycoprotein are embedded in opposite edges of the membrane. Each protein is the thickness of one of the phospholipid layers. All 3 proteins are larger than any single phospholipid. Cholesterol is also embedded in one edge of the membrane. Each cholesterol molecule is smaller than any single phospholipid. The chain of cholesterol molecules extends from the heads to the tails of the phospholipids on either side of the chain.\" class=\"lrn-image-center\" height=\"216\" src=\"/images/0fa85a303fdccc15a915a6d82d51e41f.jpg\" width=\"500\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-top:4px\">Based on Figure 1, which of the following membrane components are most likely nonpolar?</p>\n",
