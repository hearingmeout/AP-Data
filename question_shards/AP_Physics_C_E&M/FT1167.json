    "prompt": "<p>Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is important in maintaining\n homeostasis in mammals. ADH is released from the\n hypothalamus in response to high tissue osmolarity. In\n response to ADH, the collecting duct and distal tubule in the\n kidney become more permeable to water, which increases\n water reabsorption into the capillaries. The amount of\n hormone released is controlled by a negative feedback loop.</p><p>Based on the model presented, which of the following\n statements expresses the proper relationship between\n osmolarity, ADH release, and urine production?</p>",
