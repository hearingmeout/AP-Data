    "prompt": "<p style=\"margin-left: 240px;\"><img alt=\"The figure shows the Trp operon. There is a horizontal rectangle that is labeled D N A. The rectangle is divided into 9 boxes. From left to right, the first box is labeled P sub r, the second box is labeled trp R, the third box is labeled promoter, the fourth box is labeled Operator, the fifth box is labeled trp E, the sixth box is labeled trp D, the seventh box is labeled trp C, the eighth box is labeled trp B, and the ninth box is labeled trp A. Above the rectangle on the left is a large oval shape labeled R N A Polymerase. An arrow extends from the oval shape to the right and points to an X that is positioned above the boxes labeled Promoter and Operator. An irregular shape that looks like half of a circle and which is labeled R is positioned on top of the boxes labeled Promoter and Operator. A smaller oval shape labeled T is positioned partly on top of the shape labeled R. Underneath the rectangle, an arrow points downward from the box labeled trp R to a small, horizontal rectangle labeled trp R m R N A. On the left side of the rectangle is a 5 prime and a dash. On the right side of the rectangle is a dash and a 3 prime. An arrow points from the rectangle to a large oval shape labeled R. The large oval shape has a smaller oval shape cut out of it. To the left of the large oval shape are the words Inactive Repressor. A horizontal arrow points from the large oval shape to an irregular shape that looks like half of a circle and which is labeled R. A smaller oval shape labeled T is positioned partly on top of the shape labeled R. To the left of the irregular shape are the words Active Repressor. Above and to the left of the irregular shape is a small oval shape labeled T. A curved arrow extends from the shape labeled T down and to the right, eventually merging with the horizontal arrow that extends from the large oval shape on the left to the irregular shape on the right. A curved arrow extends from the irregular shape up and counterclockwise to point to the same shape that is positioned on top of the boxes labeled Promoter and Operator. There is a key below the figure that reads R equals Repressor molecule, T equals Tryptophan molecule, P sub R equals Promoter for the trp R gene, trp R equals Repressor gene, and Operator equals Binding site for repressor molecule.\" height=\"437\" src=\"/images/5223934495e5eb4cc518668153524931.png\" width=\"385\"></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Trp</em> operon is a coordinately regulated group of genes (<em>trpA</em>–<em>trpE</em>) that are required for tryptophan biosynthesis in <em>E. coli</em>.
