    "prompt": "<p>Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) can be a serious threat to human health. There is evidence that <em>S. aureus</em> infections are common in hospitals and that MRSA have become resistant to other antibiotics besides methicillin. This suggests that the rapid evolution of resistance in the bacteria poses a serious public-health challenge. Which of the following best explains the ability of MRSA to evade existing drug therapies?</p>",
