    "prompt": "<p>A series of crosses is performed with fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) to examine inheritance of the genes <em>vestigial</em> (<em>vg</em>) and <em>cinnabar</em> (<em>cn</em>). The recessive <em>vg</em> allele causes small, malformed wings called vestigial wings. The recessive <em>cn</em> allele causes bright-red eyes called cinnabar eyes.</p>\n\n<p>In the first cross, a female with wild-type wings and eyes is mated with a male with vestigial wings and cinnabar eyes. All the F<sub>1</sub> individuals have wild-type wings and eyes. In the second cross, female F<sub>1</sub> flies are mated with males with vestigial wings and cinnabar eyes. The phenotypes of 500 F<sub>2</sub> individuals are shown in the table</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 2 columns and 5 rows.
