    "prompt": "<p>A biologist is studying territoriality in three related species of birds found in the same section of a forest. For each observed pair of nesting adults, the biologist measured the distance to the next closest nesting pair of the same species (nearest-neighbor distance). An analysis of the results is shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 4 rows and 4 columns. The top row contains the labels, from left to right: column one, Species, column two, Mean Nearest Neighbor distance, open parenthesis k m close parenthesis; column 3, Median Nearest Neighbor Distance, open parenthesis k m close parenthesis; column 4, Range of Nearest Neighbor Distance, open parenthesis k m close parenthesis. From top to bottom, the data is as follows: Species I: Mean Nearest Neighbor distance, zero point three five; Median Nearest Neighbor Distance, zero point four seven; Range of Nearest Neighbor Distances, zero point two five to zero point five zero. Species 2: Mean Nearest Neighbor distance, zero point three one; Median Nearest Neighbor Distance, zero point three two; Range of Nearest Neighbor Distances, zero point three zero to zero point three two.  Species 3: Mean Nearest Neighbor distance, zero point eight zero; Median Nearest Neighbor Distance, one point one zero; Range of Nearest Neighbor Distances, zero point one zero to one point five zero.\" height=\"147\" src=\"/images/860dd24cf4ad854f8ab43f693871fe08.png\" width=\"545\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following would be most appropriate for identifying the species with the most even distribution of nests?</p>\n",
