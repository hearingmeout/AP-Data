The x-axis is labeled time of day, beginning at 6 am and ending twenty-four hours later at 6 am, in increments of two hours. The y-axis is labeled oxygen concentration in parts per million, from zero to five in increments of one. The graph is data points at every hour connected by a line. The oxygen concentration starts at approximately one at 7 and 8 am, rising to 3.5 by 5 pm. At 6 pm the hours of darkness begin, and last until 6 am. During this time the oxygen concentration decreases, returning to approximately one by 3 am and remaining there until 6 am. \" height=\"266\" src=\"/images/04db5816b4d0abd573c988b43070736e.png\" width=\"475\"></p>\n\n<p>What most likely causes the trends in oxygen concentration shown in the graph above?</p>\n",
