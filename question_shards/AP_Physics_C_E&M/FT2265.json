There is a key of plants below the time progression, containing grasses, annual plants, shrubs, oak trees and other trees. In the first time point the grass covers the ground and there are a few annual plants. The second time point has fewer grasses, two shrubs, and three oak trees. The third time point has no grass, two shrubs, two oak trees that have grown taller, and three other trees. The fourth time point has one oak tree that has grown even taller, and three other trees that have grown taller. There are no grasses, annual plants, nor shrubs. The fifth and final time point has one large oak tree and two large other trees.There are no grasses, annual plants, nor shrubs. \" height=\"220\" src=\"/images/1f823b6a410e50d58e2c7773fddf92e0.png\" width=\"545\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above shows the progression of ecological events after a fire in a particular ecosystem. Based on the diagram, which of the following best explains why the oak trees are later replaced by other trees?</p>\n",
