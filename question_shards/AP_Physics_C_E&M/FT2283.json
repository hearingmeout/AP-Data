The male measurement at woodruff between one hundred eight and two hundred, with an error bar from one hundred sixty to two hundred ten. The female measurement at woodruff is two hundred eighty with an error bar from two hundred fifty to two hundred ninety.

One study compared testosterone oxido-reductase activity between male and female alligators from Lake Woodruff, a relatively pristine environment, and from Lake Apopka, an area that has suffered severe contamination. The graph above depicts the findings of that study.</p>\n\n<p>The data in the graph best support which of the following claims?</p>\n",
