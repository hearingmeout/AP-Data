A horizontal line across the figure is labeled inner mitochondrial membrane, with four oval structures sitting across the membrane in series, touching each other, and another large structure some distance away also sitting across the membrane. There are several hydrogen ions below the membrane. NADH above the membrane pushes an electron into the first oval structure, which passes it through the next three structures. Three of the ovals are pumping hydrogen ions from above to below the membrane. The electron returns above the membrane and produces an H two O molecule with the addition of a proton and O two. On the other structure ADP plus Pi form ATP across the structure as the structure pumps hydrogen ions from below the membrane to above the membrane. ATP synthesis in chloroplast. A horizontal line across the figure is labeled thylakoid membrane, with three oval structures sitting across the membrane in series, touching each other, and another large structure some distance away also sitting across the membrane. There are several hydrogen ions below the membrane. H two O above the membrane pushes an electron into the first oval structure and releases a proton and O two. The electron passes through the next two oval structures while one oval pumps hydrogen ions from above to below the membrane. The electron returns above the membrane into a reaction of NADP plus and a proton to NADPH. On the other structure ADP plus Pi form ATP across the structure as the structure pumps hydrogen ions from below the membrane to above the membrane. \" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/295109e54bf6a02db809f3327e7cabfb.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p></p><p></p><p>The figures can best assist in answering which of the following questions?</p>",
