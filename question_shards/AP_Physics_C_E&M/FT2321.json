There is an activator on the enhancer, and general transcription factors complementary to the activator. The DNA segment is in a u-turn shape after the enhancer, and RNA polymerase two is attached to the transcription factors and the DNA directly upstream of gene x, which makes the complex of activator, general transcription factors and RNA polymerase two span from the enhancer to directly before gene X.
