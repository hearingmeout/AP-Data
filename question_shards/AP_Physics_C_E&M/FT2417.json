Row 3; Mass Extinction; End of the Devonian period; Time of Extinction; 354 million years ago; Organisms Greatly Reduced or Made Extinct; Marine families on tropical reefs, corals, brachiopods, and bivalves. Row 4; Mass Extinction; End of the Permian period; Time of Extinction; 248 million years ago; Organisms Greatly Reduced or Made Extinct; Trilobites, mollusks, brachiopods, and many vertebrates. Row 5; Mass Extinction; End of the Triassic period; Time of Extinction; 206 million years ago; Organisms Greatly Reduced or Made Extinct; Mollusks, sponges, marine vertebrates, and large amphibians.
