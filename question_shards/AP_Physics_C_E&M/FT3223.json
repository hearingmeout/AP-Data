From there, both lines drop down to 30% and 28% respectfully in the age group of 25-34.  Both lines then move up in the 35-49 age bracket—the solid line plotted at 33% and the dashed line at 29%.  The lines continue to move up to the next age bracket of 50-64, with the solid line plotted at 34% and the dashed line at just under 30%.The slope increases sharply for both lines reaching the next age bracket of 65+.
