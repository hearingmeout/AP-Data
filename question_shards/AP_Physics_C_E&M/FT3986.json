The horizontal axis is labeled molarity from zero to one point two in increments of point one with a tick mark at each increment. The vertical axis is labeled percent change in mass from negative thirty to positive twenty-five in increments of five with a tick mark at each increment. The mass begins at twenty percent on the vertical axis and zero on the horizontal axis and decreases steadily to a negative twenty-five percent change in mass at a molarity of zero point eight. At molarity of zero point two the percent change is five, at  zero point four molarity the percent change is negative eight, at zero point six molarity the percent change is negative sixteen, and then it remains constant at negative twenty-five from  zero point eight to one molarity.\" height=\"227\" src=\"/images/2528bdf48dfd7ccd75612c54e9d52ec0.png\" width=\"325\"></p>\n\n<p>Water enters and leaves the plant cells primarily by</p>\n",
