A horizontal dashed line is drawn across the graph at the center of the vertical axis. The curve starts on the y-axis below the horizontal line, and it is increasing and concave up. This section is labeled A. It then becomes nearly linear, and this section is labeled B. The line then crosses the horizontal line and becomes increasing and concave down, and this section is labeled C. The graph reaches a maximum and becomes decreasing and concave down, and this section is labeled D. The final section is decreasing and nearing an asymptote at the horizontal line, and this section is labeled E. \" src=\"/images/c47724492ad0d417c0ef13adbc350bab.png\"></p><p>The diagram above illustrates how the number of individuals in a population changed with time as a result of external stresses and resource limitations.
