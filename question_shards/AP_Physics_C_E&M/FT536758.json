Dark grey bars indicate ages 0 to 14, white bars indicate ages 15 to 44, and light grey bars indicate ages 45 to 85 plus. The pyramid is visually symmetric around the vertical axis. The bottom three bars are dark grey and are approximately the same length. The middle six bars are white and are approximately the same length as the dark grey bars. The top five bars are light grey and start out about the same length as the white bars but get slightly shorter as they go up. \" height=\"242\" src=\"/images/8a46caa80242ee84c857d30f4127002f.png\" width=\"325\"></p>\n\n<p>A country with an age distribution like that shown in the figure above, is most likely a country that</p>\n",
