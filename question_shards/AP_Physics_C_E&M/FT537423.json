Dots on the graph indicate when pesticides were applied. Each month shows a similar cycle where there is a dot indicating that pesticide was applied, and the curve indicating the number of insects drops sharply. The curve is then increasing and concave up until the pesticide application during the next month, when the cycle repeats. The amplitude of this cycle is approximately 10. The general trend is that the number of insects is increasing from March to September, as the cycle in March begins at a population of about 15 and the cycle in September is beginning at a population of about 45. \" height=\"240\" src=\"/images/25aee0a67ccb2630a905510062010f95.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n\n<p>An insect population in an agricultural field is affected by monthly applications of a pesticide, as shown in the graph above.
