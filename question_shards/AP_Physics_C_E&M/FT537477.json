It has soil moisture content on the x-axis with 14 evenly spaced tick marks along the axis. The y-axis shows the number of organisms. The curve starts on the x-axis at the first tick mark after the origin, is briefly increasing and concave up, then becomes increasing and concave down around the third tick mark, reaches a maximum at the sixth tick mark about two thirds of the way up the y-axis, is decreasing and concave down until about the eighth tick mark, and then is decreasing and concave up until meeting the x-axis at the tenth tick mark. The graph on the right is for species two. It is the same as the graph for species 1 except the line is dashed instead of solid, and the curve is shifted three tick marks to the right. u2028\" src=\"/images/b61eaa0af5a4f3e11f2080ec3b87b593.png\">\n<p>The diagrams above show the range of tolerance for soil moisture content for two different species of terrestrial invertebrate: Species 1 and Species 2. The ranges represented are for each species where it occurs alone. Soil moisture content is a limiting factor for both species. If populations of both species are placed together in a new location, which of the following diagrams represents the most likely actual (realized) ranges of the species’ distribution of individuals with respect to soil moisture content after five generations?</p>",
