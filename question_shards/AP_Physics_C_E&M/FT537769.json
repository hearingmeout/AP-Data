    "prompt": "<p>A North Carolina timber company proposes to clear-cut 45 hectares of oak-hickory deciduous forest in the Appalachian Mountains. The company has said that the forest will regrow naturally, and 50 years after the clear-cutting the company plans to harvest again, cutting all the oaks and hickories that have at least a 40-centimeter diameter. A local citizens’ group claims that this is not a realistic plan. Which of the following, if true, best supports the claim of the citizens’ group?</p>",
