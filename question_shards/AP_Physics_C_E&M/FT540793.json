True statements about the circuit include which of the following? <br> <br>I. The current in the 9 Ω resistor is three times the current in the 3 Ω resistor. <br> <br>II. The potential difference across each resistor is the same. <br> <br>III. The power dissipated in the 9 Ω resistor is greater than the power dissipated in either of the other two resistors. </p>",
