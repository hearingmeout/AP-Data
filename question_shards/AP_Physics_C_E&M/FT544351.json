He will have a survey firm ask a random sample of <em>n</em> voters whether or not they support him. He will use a large sample test for proportions to test the null hypothesis that the proportion of all voters who support him is 30 percent or less against the alternative that the percentage is higher than 30 percent. Suppose that 35 percent of all voters in the state actually support him. In which of the following situations would the power for this test be highest?</p>",
