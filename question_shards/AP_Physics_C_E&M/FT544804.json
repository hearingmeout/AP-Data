In the same district, 19 of 67 randomly selected high school juniors play a varsity sport. A 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of high school seniors who play a varsity sport in the school district and high school juniors who play a varsity sport in the school district is to be calculated. What is the standard error of the difference?</p>",
