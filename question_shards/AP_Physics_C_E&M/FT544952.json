    "prompt": "A 90 percent confidence interval is to be created to estimate the proportion of television viewers in a certain area who favor moving the broadcast of the late weeknight news to an hour earlier than it is currently. Initially, the confidence interval will be created using a simple random sample of 9,000 viewers in the area. Assuming that the sample proportion does not change, what would be the relationship between the width of the original confidence interval and the width of a second 90 percent confidence interval that is created based on a sample of only 1,000 viewers in the area?",
