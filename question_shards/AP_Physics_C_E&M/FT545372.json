    "prompt": "<p>The weight of adult male grizzly bears living in the wild in the continental United States is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 500 pounds and a standard deviation of 50 pounds. The weight of adult female grizzly bears is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 300 pounds and a standard deviation of 40 pounds. Approximately, what would be the weight of a female grizzly bear with the same standardized score (<em>z</em>-score) as a male grizzly bear with a weight of 530 pounds?</p>",
