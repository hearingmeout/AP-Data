Each time a number is called, the procedure below is followed.</p><p>• If there is no response or if an answering machine is reached, another number is automatically called.</p><p>• If a person answers, a survey worker verifies that the person is at least 18 years of age.</p><p>• If the person is not at least 18 years of age, no response is recorded, and another number is called.</p><p>• If the person is at least 18 years of age, that person is surveyed.</p><p>Some people claim the procedure being used does not permit the results to be extended to all registered voters. Which of the following is NOT a legitimate concern about the procedure being used?</p>",
