The horizontal axis meets the vertical axis at the center of the vertical axis at a point labeled O. A line is plotted starting on the vertical axis above the horizontal axis. The line starts horizontally, and a point labeled A is marked on this segment. The line then becomes linearly decreasing until it is further below the horizontal axis than it was above when it started decreasing. A point labeled B is marked on this segment before the line crosses the horizontal axis. The line then becomes horizontal again below the horizontal axis, and a point labeled C is marked on this segment. The line then becomes vertically increasing until it crosses the horizontal axis again, and steeper than it was when it was decreasing. A point labeled D is marked on this segment before it crosses the horizontal axis. Finally the line stays vertically increasing, but less steep than either of the other sections with nonzero slopes. A point labeled E is marked on this segment.\" height=\"186\" src=\"/images/5ce6a026b62647a0cf852d39040e9904.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the electric potential <em>V</em> in a region of space as a function of position along the <em>x</em>-axis.
