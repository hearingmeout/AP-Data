It has two separate lines indicating the inside and outside surfaces of the cup, which are labeled on the inside and outside of the U respectively. In the center of the cup is a circle with five plus signs in it. A vertical line is drawn up from the top of this circle. From the outside edge of the cup on the right a horizontal line is drawn to the right and then turns down, ending with a ground symbol.\" height=\"176\" src=\"/images/0a423f32fe383afe3dcd40422b5464fe.png\" width=\"250\"></p>\n\n<p>A small positively charged sphere is lowered by a nonconducting thread into a grounded metal cup without touching the inside surface of the cup, as shown above. The grounding wire attached to the outside surface is disconnected and the charged sphere is then removed from the cup.
