Going clockwise from the positive terminal, there is a resistor labeled R on the top edge of the rectangle. Next there is a capacitor labeled C on the right edge of the rectangle, and then a switch labeled S on the bottom edge of the rectangle. The circuit is completed at the negative terminal of the battery.\" src=\"/images/b3b783a71f830ec370db88e3eb9bfeeb.png\"></p><p>The capacitor <em>C</em> in the circuit shown above is initially uncharged. The switch <em>S</em> is then closed. Which of the following best represents the voltage <em>V<sub>R</sub></em> across the resistor <em>R</em> as a function of time <em>t</em>?</p>",
