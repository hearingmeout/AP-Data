    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a rectangular circuit diagram with a battery labeled epsilon at the left end of the top edge of the rectangle. The positive terminal is on the right. Going clockwise from the positive terminal there is a junction which splits into an upper and lower branch. The upper branch has a switch labeled S, then a light bulb labeled 1. The lower branch has a lightbulb labeled 2. The two branches come back together just before the right end of the top edge of the rectangle. Continuing around there is a lightbulb labeled 3 on the bottom edge of the rectangle. The circuit is then completed at the negative terminal of the battery.\" height=\"118\" src=\"/images/f9a1967e67fbcb76a56cda01da89f9cc.png\" width=\"165\"></p>\n\n<p>The three lightbulbs in the circuit above are identical, and the battery has zero internal resistance. When switch <em>S</em> is closed to cause bulb 1 to light, which of the other two bulbs increase(s) in brightness?</p>\n",
