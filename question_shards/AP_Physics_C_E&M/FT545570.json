The battery on the right is labeled 40 V and the battery on the left is labeled five point zero V. The resistor labeled 10 ohms is located between points A and B, Where A is directly vertically above point B. The other 2 resisters are not labeled with a resistance, one is to the left of point B and the other is to the right of point B. The series combination of the unlabeled resistor to the right of point B and the battery labeled 40V is connected in parallel to the resistor labeled 10 ohms. This parallel combination is connected in series to the battery labeled five point zero V and the unlabeled resistor to the left of point B. The current moving out of the battery on the right and into point A is labeled 2 point 5 A. The current moving out of point A and into the battery on the left is labeled zero point 5 zero A. \" height=\"131\" src=\"/images/16cf3d29a61c5ccf3589ef7133596112.png\" width=\"307\"></p>\n\n<p>In the circuit shown above, a student has measured the currents that are given in the diagram, but does not know all the resistance values.
