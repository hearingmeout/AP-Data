Beginning in quadrant 2, a wire with a right directional arrow labeled I, starts on the negative x-axis and reaches the intersection of the x and y axis. At the intersection, the same wire then travels vertically up along the y-axis and has an up directional arrow labeled I. A point labeled P is on the positive x-axis at distance r sub zero from the intersection of the x and y-axis. \" height=\"195\" src=\"/images/e061ea6bd4942359e83ba380caa2e469.png\" width=\"292\"></p>\n\n<p>Suppose that the magnetic field due to a very long straight wire carrying current <em>I </em>has magnitude <em>B</em><sub>0</sub> at a distance <em>r</em><sub>0 </sub>from the wire.
