For each of the experiments, the drug effect is the difference between the proportion of people taking the drug who got the disease and the proportion of people taking a placebo who got the disease. If the drug had no effect whatsoever, which of the following experimental results would be anticipated?</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman\"><li><p><em>p</em>-values will be greater than 0.05 for about 95 percent of the experiments.</p></li><li><p>There will be about an equal number of experiments showing positive and negative values of drug effect.</p></li><li><p>When 95 percent confidence intervals for the population drug effect are constructed, those confidence intervals include 0 about 95 percent of the time.</p></li></ol>",
