    "prompt": "<p>A mathematics competition uses the following scoring procedure to discourage students from guessing (choosing an answer randomly) on the multiple-choice questions. For each correct response, the score is 7. For each question left unanswered, the score is 2. For each incorrect response, the score is 0. If there are 5 choices for each question, what is the minimum number of choices that the student must eliminate before it is advantageous to guess among the rest?</p>",
