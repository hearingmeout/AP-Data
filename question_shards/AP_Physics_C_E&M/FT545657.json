The probability that a new microwave oven is damaged during delivery and stops working in less than 2 years is 0.04. The probability that a new microwave oven is damaged during delivery is 0.10. Given that a new microwave oven is damaged during delivery, what is the probability that it stops working in less than 2 years?</p>",
