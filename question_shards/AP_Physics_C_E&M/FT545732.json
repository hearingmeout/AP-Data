    "prompt": "<p>The amount of time required for each of 100 mice to navigate through a maze was recorded. The histogram below shows the distribution of times, in seconds, for the 100 mice.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a histogram with the horizontal axis labeled Time, open parenthesis, seconds, close parenthesis. The axis have tickmarks at the numbers from 60 to 120, in increments of 5, but only the numbers from 60 through 120 in increments of 10 are labeled. There are ten bars shown on the graph, one for each value of time from 70 seconds to 115 seconds, in increments of 5 seconds. The histogram is approximately bell shaped with the highest bar centered at 90 seconds. The second highest bar is centered at 85 seconds and its height is approximately 95 percent of the height of the bar at 90 seconds. The third highest bar is centered at 95 seconds and its height is approximately 70 percent of the height of the bar at 90 seconds. The fourth highest bar is centered at loo seconds and its height is approximately 55 percent of the height of the bar at 90 seconds. The fifth highest bar is centered at 80 seconds and its height is approximately 45 percent of the height of the bar at 90 seconds. The sixth highest bars are centered at 75 and 105 seconds, respectively, and their heights are approximately 30 percent of the height of the bar at 90 seconds. The eighth highest bars are centered at 70, 110, and 115 seconds, respectively, and their heights are approximately 5 percent of the height of the bar at 90 seconds.\" height=\"246\" src=\"/images/d2c8787bbc54ce56e90a30fd244a540f.png\" width=\"293\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following values is closest to the standard deviation of the 100 times?</p>\n",
