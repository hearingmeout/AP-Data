    "prompt": "<p>An experiment will be conducted to determine whether children learn their multiplication facts better by practicing with flash cards or by practicing on a computer. Children who volunteer for the experiment will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. Because the children’s gender may affect the outcome, there will be blocking by gender. After practice, the children will be given a test on their multiplication facts. Why will it be impossible to conduct a double-blind experiment?</p>",
