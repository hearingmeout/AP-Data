Prior to beginning the speed check, the officer estimates that 40 percent of motorists will be driving more than 5 miles per hour over the speed limit. Assuming that the police officer’s estimate is correct, what is the probability that among 4 randomly selected motorists, the officer will find at least 1 motorist driving more than 5 miles per hour over the speed limit?</p>",
