    "prompt": "<p>In a recent survey, high school students and their parents were asked to rate 60 recently released movies. The ratings were on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 was “horrible” and 9 was “excellent”. For each movie, the average rating by the students and the average rating by their parents was calculated and the scatterplot below was constructed.The horizontal axis represents the student rating, and the vertical axis represents the parent rating.Thus, an individual data point would represent the rating of a single movie.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a scatterplot with the title, Movie Ratings. The horizontal axis is labeled, Student Rating, and has tickmarks at the numbers from 1 to 10, from left to right in increments of 1. The vertical axis is labeled, Parent Rating, and has tickmarks at the numbers from 1 to 10, from bottom to top in increments of 1. The equation, r equals positive 0.79, is shown at the top right corner of the scatterplot. The points on the scatterplot have an overall upward curve as we move from left to right, starting with the first point at approximately 4.5 on the horizontal axis, and 2.2 on the vertical axis and the last point at approximately 9 on the horizontal axis and 8.5 on the vertical axis. Approximately 57 data points on the scatterplot are below the line, not shown, passing through the first and last point.\" height=\"298\" src=\"/images/600c504142f8a5357d4d35af136e8e08.png\" width=\"345\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following statements is justified by the scatterplot?</p>\n",
