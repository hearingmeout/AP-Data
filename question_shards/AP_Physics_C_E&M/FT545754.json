Magnetic field lines are drawn to the right coming out of the north pole with a straight line coming out of the center, a line above that is slightly concave up, and a line below it that is slightly concave down. A circular wire loop is shown around the north end of the magnet with its axis parallel to the axis of the magnet, and an arrow indicates that the loop is being pulled to the right.\" height=\"179\" src=\"/images/633d470ed78a50d052548503538e8380.png\" width=\"295\">\n<p>A conducting loop of wire that is initially around a magnet is pulled away from the magnet to the right, as indicated in the figure above, inducing a current in the loop. What is the direction of the force on the magnet and the direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the induced current?</p>\n",
