    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a circuit diagram with a 12 volt battery at the bottom. The positive terminal of the battery is on the left and the negative terminal on the right. Starting from the positive terminal and going clockwise, there is an open switch and then a resistor R sub 1 with resistance 35 ohms. Then there is a junction. The upper branch of the circuit has a resistor R sub 2 with resistance 20 ohms, and the lower branch has a resistor R sub 3 with resistance 60 ohms. The two branches then recombine and complete the circuit at the negative terminal of the battery.\" height=\"252\" src=\"/images/5d6108f9b5a496f279c54b637f355de2.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>In the circuit shown above, the equivalent resistance of the three resistors is</p>\n",
