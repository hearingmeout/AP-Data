    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a circuit diagram. At the top of the circuit is a power supply with potential difference V and its positive terminal on the left side. Going counterclockwise around the circuit from the positive terminal, next there is a variable resistor R. Then there is a parallel plate capacitor whose plates are a distance d apart. The space between the plates contains a material with dielectric constant K. From here the circuit is completed at the negative terminal of the power supply.\" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/813ee26b94b203758da4493012be72ea.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p>The plates of a parallel-plate capacitor of cross-sectional area <em>A</em> are separated by a distance <em>d</em>, as shown above.
