The left electroscope shows a negatively charged rod touching the ball on the top of the electroscope and the two leaves inside the circle separated from each other. The center electroscope shows a negatively charged rod and a person’s finger touching the ball on the top of the electroscope and the two leaves inside the circle both hang straight down. The right electroscope shows nothing touching the ball and the two leaves inside the circle separated from each other, but not as far apart as in the left electroscope.\" height=\"158\" src=\"/images/42a76bdd86c588c2e0ab436dc6bb6f43.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>When a negatively charged rod is brought near, but does not touch, the initially uncharged electroscope shown above, the leaves spring apart (I). When the electroscope is then touched with a finger, the leaves collapse (II). When next the finger and finally the rod are removed, the leaves spring apart a second time (III).
