The plate on the left has negative charge symbols and the plate on the right has 8 positive charge symbols. Just slightly to the right of the left plate and near the top of the figure, there is a particle of negative charge labeled e that has a direction arrow to the right of it that is pointing toward the right. Just slightly to the left of the right plate, near the bottom of the figure, there is a particle of positive charge labeled p that has a directional arrow to the left of it that is pointing toward the left. The top and bottom of both plates are shown as jagged edges indicating that only a portion of the plates are shown. \" height=\"274\" src=\"/images/1eac7b175d0d95acde0db73cf15d6124.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n\n<p>A proton <em>p</em> and an electron <em>e</em> are released simultaneously on opposite sides of an evacuated area between large, charged parallel plates, as shown above. Each particle is accelerated toward the oppositely charged plate. The particles are far enough apart so that they do not affect each other. Which particle has the greater kinetic energy upon reaching the oppositely charged plate?</p>\n",
