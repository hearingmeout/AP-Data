The top of the magnet is labeled S and the bottom of the magnet is labeled N. The magnet has a directional arrow pointing down that is extended as a dashed line through the center of the wire loop. \" height=\"261\" src=\"/images/55a690697769b9f096adb5d5ee66f7c4.png\" width=\"700\">\n<p>A bar magnet is lowered at constant speed through a loop of wire as shown in the diagram above. The time at which the midpoint of the bar magnet passes through the loop is <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>. Which of the following graphs best represents the time dependence of the induced current in the loop? (A positive current represents a counterclockwise current in the loop as viewed from above.)</p>",
