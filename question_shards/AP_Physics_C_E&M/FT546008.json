In each tube ,the area below the magnet is labeled Hollow Copper Tube. In the figure on the left, there is an arrow labeled v sub T right below the magnet that points down toward the bottom of the tube. In the figure on the right, there is a cylinder labeled Nonmagnetic Object on top of the permanent magnet and an unlabeled arrow below the magnet that points down to the bottom of the tube. \" height=\"234\" src=\"/images/4fa9ed0adb5fce1e08d2d29872ca9602.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n\n<p>A permanent magnet of mass <em>M </em>is dropped down the interior of a hollow cylindrical tube made of copper, as shown at left in the figure above. Friction between the inside of the tube and the magnet is negligible. As the magnet moves downward, an upward magnetic force <em>F</em><sub>B</sub> is induced, and the magnet’s velocity quickly reaches a constant terminal value <em>v</em><sub>T</sub>. A nonmagnetic object of mass <em>M </em>is attached to the permanent magnet and the drop is repeated, as shown at right in the figure above. When terminal velocity is reached, how do the new values of <em>F</em><sub>B </sub>and <em>v</em><sub>T </sub>compare with their values without the object?</p>\n",
