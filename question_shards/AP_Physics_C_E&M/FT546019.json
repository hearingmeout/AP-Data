    "prompt": "<p>Two friends, Andy and Bob, participate in a game of bowling every week. From past experiences, it is known that both friends’ scores are approximately normally distributed, where Andy has a mean score of 150 with a standard deviation of 30, and Bob has a mean score of 165 with a standard deviation of 15. Assuming that their scores are independent, which of the following values is closest to the probability that Andy will have a greater score than Bob in a single game?</p>",
