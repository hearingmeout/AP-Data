The motel manager wants to get a better estimate of the distance and asks five people to each measure the distance, to the nearest tenth of a mile, using the odometer in his or her car. The manager will use the median of the five measurements as the estimate of the distance. Which of the following statements is NOT a statistical justification for the manager’s plan?</p>",
