Histogram J has a horizontal axis with tickmarks for the numbers from 0 to 32, in increments of 8. There are nine bars on the histogram each with a base of length 4, starting with a bar for the values between 0 and 4. The highest bar is located to the right of the initial bar, and corresponds to the values between 4 and 8. The heights of the bars decrease sharply as you move to the right after the peak bar ending with the last bar for the values between 32 and 36. The height of the last bar is very low.  Histogram K has a horizontal axis with tickmarks for the numbers from 8 to 48, in increments of 8. There are nine bars on the histogram starting with a bar with a very low height corresponding to the values between 8 and 12. There is a gap in the histogram from 12 to 16. As we move from left to right, the heights of the bars increase sharply after the gap until the highest bar that corresponds to the values between 40 and 44. The bar to the right of the highest bar is approximately half as high as the highest bar.  Histogram L has a horizontal axis with tickmarks for the numbers from 24 to 72, in increments of 12. There are nine bars on the histogram starting with a bar with a very low height corresponding to the values from 18 to 24. The histogram is approximately bell shaped with the highest bar corresponding to the values between 42 and 48. The last bar is the second lowest bar and corresponds to the values between 72 and 78.\" height=\"221\" src=\"/images/580e6c9e37a02bc4733d382565c0e235.jpg\" width=\"587\"></p>\n\n<p>For the three histograms above, which of the following correctly orders the histograms from the one with the smallest proportion of data above its mean to the one with the largest proportion of data above its mean?</p>\n",
