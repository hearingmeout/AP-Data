    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows two electrical circuits.  On the left is figure 1, with a battery labeled epsilon and two capacitors in series, labeled Y and Z.  Both capacitors have a slab inside of them. On the right is figure 2, with a battery labeled epsilon and two capacitors in series, labeled Y and Z. In figure 2, Y still has a slab, but there is an arrow near capacitor Z showing that the slab in capacitor Z has moved horizontally to the right and out of Z.\" height=\"123\" src=\"/images/80062b6564cb26aa3e8274db114b2aaf.png\" width=\"280\"></p>\n\n<p>Two identical capacitors, Y and Z, are connected in series with an ideal battery, as shown in figure 1 above, and fully charged. Each capacitor has a dielectric slab of dielectric constant 𝜅 &gt; 1 between its plates. If the dielectric slab is removed from capacitor Z, which of the following describes what happens to the voltage across each capacitor?</p>\n",
