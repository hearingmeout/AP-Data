They asked each student in a random sample of 50 students how many text messages he or she sent yesterday. An appropriate <em>t</em>-test was conducted and resulted in a <em>p</em>-value of 0.0853. Assuming the conditions for the<em> t</em>-test were met, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?</p>",
