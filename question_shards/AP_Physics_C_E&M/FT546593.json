    "prompt": "A carnival game allows the player a choice of simultaneously rolling two, four, six, eight, or ten fair dice. Each die has six faces numbered 1 through 6, respectively. After the player rolls the dice, the numbers that appear on the faces that land up are recorded. The player wins if the <u>greatest</u> number recorded is 1 or 2. How many dice should the player choose to roll to maximize the chance of winning?",
