    "prompt": "A machine is designed to dispense at least 12 ounces of a beverage into a bottle. To test whether the machine is working properly, a random sample of 50 bottles was selected and the mean number of ounces for the 50 bottles was computed. A test of the hypotheses H<sub>0</sub> : <em>µ</em> = 12 versus H<sub>a</sub> : <em>µ</em> &lt; 12 was conducted, where <em>µ</em> represents the population mean number of ounces of the beverage dispensed per bottle by the machine. The <em>p</em>-value for the test was 0.08. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion to draw at the significance level of <em>α</em> = 0.05?",
