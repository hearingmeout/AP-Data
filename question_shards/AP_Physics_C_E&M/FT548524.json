For a shipment of roses that was delivered to the store, the florist flipped a coin before placing each rose in its own individual container with water. If the coin landed heads up, the rose was placed in water with the new powder; otherwise, the rose was placed in water alone. Which of the following is the best description of the method used by the florist?</p>",
