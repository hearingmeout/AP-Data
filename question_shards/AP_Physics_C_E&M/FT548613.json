    "prompt": "<p>Meteorologists are interested in the relationship between minimum pressure and maximum wind speed of hurricanes. The minimum pressure, in millibars, and maximum wind speed, in knots, were collected for a random sample of 100 hurricanes from the year 1995 to the year 2012. A regression analysis of maximum wind speed on minimum wind pressure produced a 95 percent confidence interval of (-1.42, -1.20) for the slope of the least-squares regression line. Which statement is a correct interpretation of the interval?</p>",
