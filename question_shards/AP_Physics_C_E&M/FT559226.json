There is an arrow running from the top of the mechanism through the center to the bottom of the mechanism. The top of the arrow is labeled “High, open bracket, H plus, close bracket.” The bottom of the arrow is labeled “Low, open bracket, H plus, close bracket.” On the bottom left of the mechanism, a curved arrow is present. The curve of the arrow is the only portion making contact with the mechanism. The beginning of the arrow is labeled “A D P plus P subscript i.” The end of the arrow is labeled “A T P.”\" height=\"244\" src=\"/images/2acca9f16af29b9c9de1a767979e3abd.png\" width=\"150\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following questions will best direct an investigation of the mechanism of ATP synthase?</p>\n",
