Hormone 1 shows H subscript 1 extend to R subscript 1, which extends to G protein activating protein. It then extends to G protein, which then extends to phosphorylating protein. It continues to extend to transcription activation protein and ends at cell division. Hormone 2 shows H subscript 2 extend to R subscript 2, which extends to G protein inactivating protein and ends with a flat end, not an arrow.  There is a key to this graphic: H represents Hormone; R represents Membrane receptor; G represents G protein; G - P A P represents G -  protein activating protein; G - P I P represents G - protein inactivating protein; P P represents Phosphorylating protein; T A P represents Transcription activation protein.\" height=\"264\" src=\"/images/6e91cbd0f5019a305685684eccc6f830.jpg\" width=\"455\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above represents a model of signal transduction pathways (I and II) in a cell that is targeted by two different hormones (H<sub>1 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>). The components of the signal transduction pathways are identified in the figure legend. Each cellular molecule in both pathways can exist in an inactive or active form. When the components in pathway I are sequentially activated, the TAP molecules promote cell division. When the components in pathway II are sequentially activated, downstream signaling by the G protein is inhibited. Based on the model, which of the following mutations is most likely to result in a cell that will generate a cancerous tumor?</p>\n",
