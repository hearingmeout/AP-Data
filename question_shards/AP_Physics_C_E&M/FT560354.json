The horizontal axis is labeled Time, with a right-facing arrow below the label. The vertical axis on the left is labeled Prey Population Size, and the vertical axis on the right is labeled Predator Population Size. Two lines appear on the graph. A solid line labeled Prey begins halfway up the left vertical axis. Moving from left to right, the solid line curves gradually up, reaches a maximum, then curves steeply down, and reaches a minimum, and then curves gradually back up. The line continues this pattern for 3 cycles, and ends one third of the way up the right vertical axis.   A dashed line labeled Predator begins near the bottom of the left vertical axis, at a minimum, moves briefly to the right, and then curves steeply up, reaches a maximum below and to the right of the first Prey maximum point, then curves steeply down and to the right, and levels off before intersecting the horizontal axis, at a minimum, and then moves to the right, continuing this pattern for 3 cycles. The dashed line always remains below the solid line, and neither lines intersect the horizontal axis.\" height=\"264\" src=\"/images/5628df2466f285ce23f64ea961b98f27.png\" width=\"325\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following data would be most helpful in predicting possible disruptions to the relationship between the predator and its prey?</p>\n",
