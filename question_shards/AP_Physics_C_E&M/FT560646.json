    "prompt": "Lemurs are primates that live on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa. Lemurs have a functional <em>GULO</em> gene and are able to produce ascorbic acid. However, primates that live in other places (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans) have a <em>GULO</em> pseudogene and are unable to produce ascorbic acid. Which of the following best explains the genetic variation among primate species?",
