The cells are oriented so that the oviduct is at the top of each image. Below the images is a right-facing arrow labeled Time. In the first image from the left, there is no fluorescent dye visible in any of the cells. In the second image from the left, there is fluorescent dye surrounding a large circular structure near the center of each cell. In the third image from the left, there is fluorescent dye surrounding a large circular structure near the center of each cell and more fluorescent dye inside flat, pancake-like structures that appear to be stacked one on top of the other close to the top surface of each cell. In the fourth image from the left, there is fluorescent dye surrounding a large circular structure near the center of each cell and inside the flat, pancake-like structures, and also inside multiple small circles near the top surface of each cell. In the fifth image from the left, there is fluorescent dye surrounding a large circular structure near the center of each cell, inside the flat, pancake-like structures, inside multiple small circles near the top surface of each cell, and also outside the cells in the oviduct.\" height=\"147\" src=\"/images/edc39b6d26df3ff25b895d0997c411c6.png\" width=\"555\"></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows a series of microscope images taken over time of ovalbumin production in chick oviduct cells in response to stimulation with estrogen.
