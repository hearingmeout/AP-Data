    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The image is a map, titled Eurasia, Around 100 C.E. The map shows the Asian continent, as well as the upper, eastern portion of Africa. Countries shown on the map include Egypt, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Persia, India, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Malaysia, and Sumatra. The perimeter of the Asian continent is encircled by a solid black line extending from Egypt eastward around the coast of Arabia to India. From India, the line splits in two directions, one moving back west along the coast of Persia where it stops between Mesopotamia and Persia; the other line continues eastward along the coast of India. When it reaches the bottom tip of India, the line splits, with one moving across the northern part of the Bay of Bengal where it intersects with the area between India and China. The other line moves diagonally across the Bay of Bengal where it intersects with the southern area of China. From there, the line moves southward and around the tip of Malaysia where it begins moving upward through the South China Sea toward China, eventually splitting into two lines that intersect China in two different places. On the map, a dashed line extends from the city of Tyre along the southeastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and down into Arabia. A dashed line extends from the city of Antioch along the northeastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea across Persia, passing through the cities Ctesiphon and Merv; across Tibet and Mongolia, passing through the cities Kashgar, Khotan, Turpan, and Dunhuang; down into India, passing through the cities Taxila and Mathura; and throughout China, passing through the cities Changan and Luoyang and south toward the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. At numerous points along the coast, the dashed line intersects with the solid black line. In the lower left corner of the map is a box, titled Equatorial Scale, showing distance in miles from zero to 600, and kilometers from zero to 1,000.\" src=\"/images/5b54c90f7d368d20b4988a621faaefcf.png\"></p><p>The lines on the map above illustrate which of the following?</p>",
