    "prompt": "<p>Both species of garter snakes prey on the California newt, <em>Taricha torosa</em>, a small amphibian that produces a potent neurotoxin (TTX) in its skin. However, neither species of garter snake is affected by TTX. The resistance to TTX is associated with mutations in the <em>SCN4A </em>gene. Which of the following best supports a claim that TTX resistance arose independently in <em>T. atratus </em>and <em>T. sirtalis </em>?</p>",
