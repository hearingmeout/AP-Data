    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure presents a part of a circuit containing two capacitors, C sub 1 and C sub 2, connected in parallel. Two points, A and B, are indicated on the circuit. Capacitor C sub 1 is on the left vertical branch and capacitor C sub 2 is on the right vertical branch. Point A is indicated on the top horizontal branch, and point B is indicated on the bottom horizontal branch. At these points, vertical wires are shown coming from the circuit. Point A is directly above point B.\" height=\"164\" src=\"/images/f7effc604d17870eeaf2172de39a5cfb.png\" width=\"160\"></p>\n\n<p>Capacitors <em>C<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>C<sub>2</sub></em> are connected as shown in the circuit above. The capacitance of <em>C<sub>1</sub></em> is C, and the capacitance of <em>C<sub>2</sub></em> is <em>C/3</em> . The equivalent capacitance between points A and B is <em>C<sub>EQ</sub></em>. A dielectric is inserted into capacitor <em>C<sub>2</sub></em> , and the equivalent capacitance between points A and B is now <em>2C<sub>EQ</sub></em> . What is the value of the dielectric constant for this dielectric?</p>\n",
