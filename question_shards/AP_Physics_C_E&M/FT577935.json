The power supply generates a current <em>I </em>that is given as a function of time <em>t </em>by the equation <em>I </em>=<em> I<sub>0</sub></em> (1-<em>t</em>/<em>k</em>), where <em>I<sub>0</sub></em> = 4.0 A and <em>k </em>= 2.0 s . What is the magnitude of the potential difference across the inductor induced by the changing current?</p>\n",
