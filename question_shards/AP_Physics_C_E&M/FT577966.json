Moving clockwise around the circuit, the right side has a resistor labeled R. The voltmeter is on a parallel branch that is to the right of resistor R, with connections above and below resistor R. The bottom side has an open switch labeled S.\" src=\"/images/403047c1ca5ffac9e1f2eca354400c3a.png\">\n<p>A charged capacitor C, resistor R, and switch S are connected in series. Voltmeter V is connected in parallel with the resistor, as shown in the figure above. At time t = 0, the switch is then closed. Which of the following shows the potential difference ΔV reading on the voltmeter as a function of time t after the switch is closed?</p>",
