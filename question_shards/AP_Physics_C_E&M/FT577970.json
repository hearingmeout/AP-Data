The top side of the circuit has an unlabeled battery and a resistor labeled lowercase r. There is a box made of dashed lines drawn around the battery and resistor lowercase r. The bottom side of the circuit has a resistor labeled 3 times uppercase R. The current is labeled I over 2, and is directed up the right side of the circuit. \" height=\"123\" src=\"/images/5050e3cbfdb3eccdd973280a4dbc71d5.png\" width=\"370\"></p>\n\n<p>When a battery is connected to an external resistance R, as shown above on the left, there is a current I in the circuit. When the external resistance is changed to 3R, the current changes to I/2, as shown above on the right. What is the internal resistance r of the battery?</p>\n",
