There is a cloud in the upper left corner with rain and the label weathering. There is a label inorganic in rock under the rain cloud on a rock formation There is an arrow from inorganic in rocks to inorganic in water and there is a river through the rock formation. There is an arrow from inorganic in water to inorganic in ocean. There is an arrow from inorganic in ocean to inorganic in sediments. There is an arrow from inorganic in sediments to the rock and the label uplift over geological time. There is a label for organic in plants under the rain cloud over trees. There is an arrow to from organic in plants to organic in soil with the label decay. There is an arrow from organic in soil to available inorganic in soil. There are three arrows from available inorganic in soil. One arrow points upward to the trees and the label organic in plants. A two headed arrow connects available inorganic in soil to unavailable inorganic in soil. The third arrow connects available inorganic in soil to inorganic in water. The inorganic in water has an arrow to inorganic in ocean connecting the cycle.\" height=\"372\" src=\"/images/114196c25cfeec314394afe40c8058ac.png\" width=\"650\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The diagram above best illustrates major processes in which of the following biogeochemical cycles?</p>\n",
