The third curve is labeled “Type 3,” and begins at 100 percent of organisms surviving, curving very steeply downward and to the right until approximately one third across the horizontal access, when it begins to move very slightly downward and to the right until it reaches the rightmost part of the horizontal access and 1 percent of organisms surviving.\" height=\"279\" src=\"/images/7784e8f0391bad630c8badd5f2302308.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is a characteristic of an organism that displays a Type <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"3\"><math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>III</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> survivorship curve, as shown in the graph above?</p>\n",
