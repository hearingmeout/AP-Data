The following histograms summarize the relative frequency for each type of catfish.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents two histograms. The first histogram is titled Distribution of Fingerling Catfish and has a horizontal axis labeled Number per River, and the numbers 2,000 through 12,000, in increments of 2,000, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Relative Frequency, and the numbers 0 through 0.35, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. The data represented in the histogram are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. 2,000 through 3,000 catfish, 0. 3,000 through 4,000 catfish, 0.07. 4,000 through 5,000 catfish, 0.15. 5,000 through 6,000 catfish, 0.04. 6,000 through 7,000 catfish, 0.10. 7,000 through 8,000 catfish, 0.27. 8,000 through 9,000 catfish, 0.07. 9,000 through 10,000 catfish, 0.04. 10,000 through 11,000 catfish, 0.26. 11,000 through 12,000 catfish, 0. The second histogram is titled Distribution of Large Catfish. The horizontal axis is labeled Number per River, and the numbers 250 through 2,250, in increments of 250, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Relative Frequency, and the numbers 0 through 0.35, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. The data represented in the histogram are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. 250 through 500 catfish, 0.20. 500 through 750 catfish, 0.18. 750 through 1,000 catfish, 0.18. 1,000 through 1,250 catfish, 0.15. 1,250 through 1,500 catfish, 0.15. 1,500 through 1,750 catfish, 0.07. 1,750 through 2,000 catfish, 0.03. 2,000 through 2,250 catfish, 0.03.\" height=\"593\" src=\"/images/aee41fe3adc41d7316c65cf11579b214.png\" width=\"500\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the histograms, which of the following is the best comparison of the means and the ranges for the two distributions?</p>\n",
