The following histograms summarize the distributions of the root-mean-square times for two sources of disturbances.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents 2 histograms titled Earthquake Disturbances and Mining Disturbances. Both histograms have horizontal axes labeled, Root Mean Square Time, and the numbers 0.0 through 1.6, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The vertical axes are labeled, Relative Frequency, and the numbers 0.0 through 0.40, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. The data represented by the histogram for Earthquake Disturbances are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Root Mean Square Time 0.0 through 0.2, 0.35. Root Mean Square Time 0.2 through 0.4, 0.20. Root Mean Square Time 0.4 through 0.6, 0.10. Root Mean Square Time 0.6 through 0.8, 0.10. Root Mean Square Time 0.8 through 1.0, 0.09. Root Mean Square Time 1.0 through 1.2, 0.08. Root Mean Square Time 1.2 through 1.4, 0.06. Root Mean Square Time 1.4 through 1.6, 0.025.&nbsp;The data represented by the histogram for Mining Disturbances is as follows. Note that all values are approximate.
