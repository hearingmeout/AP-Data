San Francisco and Los Angeles are indicated on the map along the coast. A line labeled Mendocino Fracture Zone begins in the northern Pacific Ocean and moves slightly downward and to the right. As the line approaches the coast of northern California, it moves steeply downward and crosses into the United States just below San Francisco. The line continues downward through the United States passing to the right of and above Los Angeles until it passes through Mexico and into the Gulf of California where the line becomes slashes. The line is labeled San Andreas Fault. An arrow to the lower left of the line is labeled Relative Motion of Pacific Plate, and points up and to the left. Another arrow to the right of the line is labeled Relative Motion of North American Plate, and points down and to the right.\" height=\"401\" src=\"/images/325eb4f414a7bf1c3d572a1725361ae6.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements best describes the boundary between the two tectonic plates seen in the map?</p>\n",
