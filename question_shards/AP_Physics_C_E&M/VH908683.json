One example is the orchid mantis that is highly camouflaged when standing on a certain species of orchid found in tropical environments. Another species, the tropical cockroach, can live anywhere in the rain forest where it can find water and a food source.</p></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements best describes why it is predicted that the orchid mantis will be more affected by global climate change than the tropical cockroach will be?</p>\n",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">As the climate changes, the number of orchids is likely to increase, leading to more competition for space by the mantis population.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Orchid mantises tend to be advantaged in habitats that remain constant; the rain forest habitat is likely to shift because of global climate change.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Orchid mantises are generalists, so global climate change will give them more diverse habitats to colonize.</p>",
