    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A teacher at a culinary arts school will conduct an experiment to investigate which of three methods of instruction works best in teaching students how to make a good pie crust. Each student in a group of 60 students will be randomly assigned to one of three methods: in-person demonstration by the instructor, watching a video, and reading a recipe. The students will be assigned so that each method will have 20 students. Each pie crust made will be judged on its taste and texture. What are the treatments of the experiment?</p>\n",
