The top side of the circuit has a metal strip in parallel with a voltmeter. The bottom side has an ammeter to the right of a variable battery. A note indicates that the battery ranges from 0 volts to 12 volts D C. The line graph has a horizontal axis labeled I and vertical axis labeled V. The line begins at the origin and moves diagonally upward and to the right.\" height=\"186\" src=\"/images/2ff93640dfa5599554b81d685f8928c5.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An experiment is performed using a strip of metal. The strip is connected in the circuit shown above, and the potential difference across the strip and the current passing through it are measured. The best-fit line of the data is shown on the graph above. One adjustment will be made to the setup, and the experiment will be repeated. Which of the following best indicates the change and the new best-fit line graph of the data that would result from this change?</p>\n",
