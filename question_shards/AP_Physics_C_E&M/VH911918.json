    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">For a specific species of fish in a pond, a wildlife biologist wants to build a regression equation to predict the weight of a fish based on its length. The biologist collects a random sample of this species of fish and finds that the lengths vary from 0.75 to 1.35 inches. The biologist uses the data from the sample to create a single linear regression model. Would it be appropriate to use this model to predict the weight of a fish of this species that is 3 inches long?</p>\n",
    "answer": "i4",
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the regression equation is based on a random sample.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the association between length and weight is positive.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because there may not be any 3-inch fish of this species in the pond.</p>",
