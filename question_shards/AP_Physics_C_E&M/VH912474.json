    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A chemist for a paint company conducted an experiment to investigate whether a new outdoor paint will last longer than the older paint. Fifty blocks made from the same wood were randomly assigned to be painted with either the new paint or the old paint. The blocks were placed into a weather-controlled room that simulated extreme weather conditions such as ice, temperature, wind, and sleet. After one month in the room, the blocks were removed, and each block was rated on texture, shine, brightness of color, and chipping. The results showed that the blocks painted with the new paint generally had higher ratings than the blocks painted with the old paint. However, an analysis of the results found that the difference in ratings was <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">not</span> statistically significant. What can be concluded from the experiment?</p>\n",
