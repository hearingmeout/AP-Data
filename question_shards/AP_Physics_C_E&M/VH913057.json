The vertical axis is labeled Relative Activity, and no numbers are indicated, although an arrowhead is present at the top of the axis. The line begins at the origin and moves horizontally to the right until reaching a p H of 5. It then moves upward and to the right where, at a p H of 6, the line is about one fifteenth of the way up the vertical axis. The line then moves steeply upward and to the right where, at a p H of 7, the line is approximately three quarters of the way up the vertical axis. The line continues to move upward and to the right. At a p H of 8, the line is near the top of the vertical axis. The line then begins to move downward and to the right, so that at a p H of 9, the line is slightly below the peak. The line ends at a p H of 10 and approximately three quarters of the way up the vertical axis.\" height=\"297\" src=\"/images/7c9ce243f2e68831ee988edd1874a0fe.png\" width=\"350\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
