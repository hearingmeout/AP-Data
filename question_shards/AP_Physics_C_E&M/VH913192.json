The horizontal axis is labeled Moose Density, in moose per kilometers squared, and the numbers 1.0 to 2.0, in increments of 0.1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Percent Change in Wolf Population, and the numbers negative 25 through 10, in increments of 5, are indicated. There are 19 data points in the scatterplot. Note that all values are approximate. The data points begin in the upper left part of the plane at the point with coordinates 1.1 comma 7. The data points trend steadily downward and to the right. The rightmost point is the point with the coordinates 1.98 comma negative 9, and the lowest point is the point with coordinates 1.78 comma negative 20.\" height=\"353\" src=\"/images/27d0517cf00b45fbe23a7ebb050c1d1e.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Suppose the variables on the scatterplot were reversed, so that moose density was the response variable on the vertical axis, and percent change in wolf population was the explanatory variable on the horizontal axis.
