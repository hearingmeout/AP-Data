The first reaction shows two identical monomers, each of which is a six-sided ring with an oxygen atom at one point of the ring, O H groups attached to four other points, and a C H 2 O H group attached to the sixth point. O H groups from the two points of the monomers that are closest to each other react so that a single oxygen atom links the two monomers, with H 2 O as a byproduct. The second reaction shows two similar monomers, each with a central carbon atom. Attached to each of the carbon atoms is an N H 2 group, a hydrogen atom, and a C O O H group. The first of the two monomers also has a C H 3 group attached to the carbon atom, while the second monomer instead has an H atom attached to the carbon. The C O O H group from the first monomer and the H 2 N group from the second monomer react to create a bond between a carbon and a nitrogen that links the two monomers, with H 2 O as a byproduct.\" height=\"229\" src=\"/images/04d96c5466b0a75b9d6736455d1218b4.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is common feature of the illustrated reactions showing the linking of monomers to form macromolecules?</p>\n",
