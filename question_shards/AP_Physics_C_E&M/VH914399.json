    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">To investigate the effectiveness of an herbal medication for pain relief, a researcher randomly selected 80 patients who were undergoing physical therapy while recovering from an injury. Of the patients, 40 had knee injuries, 16 had arm injuries, and 24 had foot injuries. The researcher will use two treatments for the investigation: the herbal medication and a standard medication. After the patients are on the medication for two weeks, the amount of pain reduction will be measured for each patient. Which of the following best describes why a randomized block design is appropriate for the investigation?</p>\n",
