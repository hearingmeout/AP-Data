An arrow indicates that a plant provides O 2 for a fish, and the fish provides C O 2 for the plant. The fish also provides ammonia, N H 3, for bacteria living in the gravel. The bacteria convert the ammonia to nitrites, N O 2, and to nitrates, N O 3, that are taken up by the plant.\" height=\"288\" src=\"/images/aa205bbd56db969f1c556ce0fb6f0c62.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements best describes how molecules released by the fish become nutrients for the plants?</p>\n",
