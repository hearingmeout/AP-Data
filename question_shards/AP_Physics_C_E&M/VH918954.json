They base their model on the idea that smaller cells absorb nutrients more efficiently. The researchers predict that the mean diameter of phytoplankton cells will change by 50 micrometers for every 5-kilometer increase in distance from the shore because of a gradual decrease in nutrient availability. To test their model, the researchers determine that the phytoplankton cells found closest to shore have a mean diameter of 900 micrometers.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the model, what will be the mean diameter of the phytoplankton cells that are found 25 kilometers from shore?</p>\n",
