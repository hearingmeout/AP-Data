      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">At the anode, hydrogen is oxidized and electrons flow in a circuit to the cathode. At the cathode, oxygen reacts with the hydrogen to produce water. Water and heat are by-products of the reaction.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">At the anode, hydrogen is oxidized and electrons pass through an electrolyte to the cathode. There, the protons react with water to produce oxygen. Water and heat are by-products of the reaction.</p>",
