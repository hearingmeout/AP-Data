Based on the student’s academic record, the probability that the student will be awarded a scholarship from Agency A is 0.55 and the probability that the student will be awarded a scholarship from Agency B is 0.40. Furthermore, if the student is awarded a scholarship from Agency A, the probability that the student will be awarded a scholarship from Agency B is 0.60. What is the probability that the student will be awarded at least one of the two scholarships?</p>\n",
