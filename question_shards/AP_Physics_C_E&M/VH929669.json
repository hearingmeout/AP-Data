The vertical axis is labeled Global Hectares, in billions, and the numbers 0 through 25, in increments of 5, are indicated. The graph contains two lines of data for Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Data for Ecological Footprint. The line begins at the year 1961 and 7 billion Global Hectares, and moves upward and to the right until it reaches the year 2014 and 21 billion Global Hectares. Data for Biocapacity.
