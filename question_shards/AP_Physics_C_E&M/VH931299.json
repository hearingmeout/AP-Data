    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In a certain population of birds, about 40 percent of the birds have a wingspan greater than 10 inches. Biologists studying the birds will create a simulation with random numbers to estimate the probability of finding 1 bird in a sample of 6 birds with a wingspan greater than 10 inches. Which of the following assignments of the digits 0 to 9 will model the population?</p>\n",
