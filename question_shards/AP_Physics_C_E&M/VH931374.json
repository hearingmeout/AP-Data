The top of the figure shows two molecules. Each molecule has a central C atom that is bonded with four other atoms or groups. One bond of the C atom is with an N atom that is also bonded with two H atoms. A second bond of the C atom is with a C atom that is also bonded with an O H group and double bonded with an O atom. In each molecule, the central C atom is also bonded with an H atom. In one of the molecules, the fourth bond of the C atom is with an H atom. In the other molecule, the fourth bond of the C atom is with a C H 3 group. An arrow points to a new molecule that is formed when the two molecules join with a byproduct of a water molecule. The new molecule has a six-atom backbone, that from the left to the right is composed of the following atoms: N, C, C, N, C, C. The leftmost N atom is also bonded with two H atoms, the next C atom is also bonded with two H atoms, the next C atom is also double-bonded with an O atom, the next N atom is also bonded with one H atom, the next C atom is also bonded with an H atom and a C H 3 group, and the final C atom is bonded with an O H group and double-bonded with an O atom.\" height=\"239\" src=\"/images/cb1c036bb9f6d92776c9ada0a7ba3eeb.png\" width=\"300\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
