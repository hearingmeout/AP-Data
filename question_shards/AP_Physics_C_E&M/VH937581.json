Two pathways exist, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, which converge during clot formation. There are many clotting factors involved, most of which are proteins. Vitamin <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"K\"><math alttext=\"K\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is required for the formation of the active form of several of the clotting factors, including Factor <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10\"><math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>X</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>. A simplified model of the blood clotting process is shown in Figure 1.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a simplified model of the clotting cascade. The model is as follows. Two pathways, the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway, converge to cause clot formation. The extrinsic pathway begins with damage to the tissue outside a vessel which initiates the release of thromboplastin from the tissue. The intrinsic pathway begins with damage to a blood vessel which triggers a cascade of clotting factors. The thromboplastin and the cascade of clotting factors both mediate the conversion of inactive Factor 10 to activated Factor 10. Activated Factor 10 then triggers the conversion of Prothrombin to Thrombin. Thrombin then triggers the conversion of Fibrinogen to Fibrin. Factor 13 interacts with Fibrin to produce a blood clot.\" height=\"499\" src=\"/images/3ab273f5a0e19eb31436394f8f6af2de.png\" width=\"700\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
