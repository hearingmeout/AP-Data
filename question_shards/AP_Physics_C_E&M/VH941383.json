Three simulations, A, B, and C, were designed to create a sampling distribution of a sample proportion from a population with proportion 0.70. Each simulation consisted of 2,500 trials. For each trial of a simulation, a sample of size <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n\"><math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> was selected at random, and the sample proportion was recorded. The value of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n\"><math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> varied among the simulations. The following histograms summarize the results of the simulations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a histogram with 10 bars of data, labeled Simulation A. The horizontal axis has the values 0.50 through 0.90, in increments of 0.10. The vertical axis is labeled, Relative Frequency, and no values are indicated along it. The data represented in the histogram are as follows. Beginning with the bar between 0.45 and 0.50, the bars begin at a height slightly above the lowest point on the vertical axis and then increase, reaching a peak at 0.70 near the top of the vertical axis.
