An independent random sample of cats was taken from each population, and the difference between the sample proportions of cats with the spotted markings (C minus F) was 0.62. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis being that the population proportions are not equal. The <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value of the test was 0.01.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value?</p>\n",
