To test this claim, the scientist obtained data from two random samples of voters categorized into two age-groups, older and younger. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the proportions of voters in the two age-groups who would be affected by negative ads. The alternative hypothesis was that the proportion of younger voters affected would be greater than the proportion of older voters affected.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assuming all conditions for inference were met, the scientist conducted the test at a significance level of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"alpha equals 0.05\"><math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
