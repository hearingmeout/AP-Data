      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Biomass production requires less open space than fossil fuel extraction does, so land is available for other purposes.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Burning biomass is associated with fewer human respiratory concerns than fossil fuels are because it does not give off sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Biomass production is cheaper than fossil fuel extraction, making it more readily available for use.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Burning biomass is more efficient than burning fossil fuels, providing more available energy from less of the resource.</p>",
