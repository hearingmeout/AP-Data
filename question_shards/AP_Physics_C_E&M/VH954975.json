In the first part, the chromosomes are straight and parallel to each other. In the second part of the figure, the bottom portion of one unshaded chromatid is crossed over the bottom portion of one shaded chromatid. In the third part of the figure, there are four individual chromosomes, one that is unshaded, one with the top three fourths unshaded and the bottom one fourth shaded, one with the top three fourths shaded and the bottom one fourth unshaded, and one that is all shaded.\" height=\"135\" src=\"/images/c86bb5412b00ea0e12ea31a5fa6776d3.png\" width=\"500\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
