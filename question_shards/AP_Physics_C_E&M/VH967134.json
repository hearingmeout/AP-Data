The purpose of the experiment is to determine a value for the permittivity constant <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"epsilon sub 0\"><math alttext=\"epsilon sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>. The capacitor is fully charged and then placed in the circuit shown, where the voltmeter can be used to measure the potential difference across the plates. Measurements for the potential difference are made as the distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> between the plates is increased, and the data are shown in the graph. According to the equation <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C equals epsilon sub 0, times the fraction A over d\"><math alttext=\"C equals epsilon sub 0, times the fraction A over d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mfrac><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, the graph should be linear. This is true for small values of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, but for larger values the graph diverges from the straight line.
