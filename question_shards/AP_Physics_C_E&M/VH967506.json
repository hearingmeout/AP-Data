When the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, collagen fibers in the wall are exposed to the interior of the blood vessel. The exposed fibers and chemicals released from the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel attract platelets, which start to form a plug and release other chemicals (Figure 1).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram of a cross section of a blood vessel. The blood vessel walls are shown above and below the interior of the blood vessel. Three layers of the blood vessel wall are shown, from outermost to innermost: smooth muscle, collagen layer, and endothelial cells. The upper blood vessel wall is intact, but the lower one has been damaged and appears torn. In the region of the damage, the collagen layer and endothelial cells protrude slightly toward the interior of the blood vessel. A cluster of platelets adheres to the exposed collagen and endothelial cells. A gradient of platelets and released chemicals is shown, with more of each closer to the damaged vessel wall and fewer of each toward the central interior of the blood vessel. A circular arrow is drawn that points from the cluster of adhering platelets toward the interior of the blood vessel and then curves back around to end near the cluster of platelets.\" height=\"208\" src=\"/images/71acee8c6bf5ebf72bf565b0486687d6.png\" width=\"550\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
