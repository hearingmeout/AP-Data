One hypothesis states that membrane structure is static and membrane components throughout the bilayer are rigidly bound. Alternatively, the other hypothesis states that cell membranes are a fluid mosaic in which membrane components may drift within the bilayer around the surface of the cell. An experiment is set up in which membrane proteins of two different cells are fluorescently labeled with two different colors and then fused as shown in Figure 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a model of a cell fusion experiment. There are two cells, and the membranes of each cell have proteins embedded in them. The membrane proteins in one cell are colored grey, and the membrane proteins in the other cell are colored black. The figure shows the grey cell and the black cell beginning to merge.\" height=\"126\" src=\"/images/084d253a76c70f58d16af6dcaa7a515f.png\" width=\"300\">\n<p class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">Figure 1.
