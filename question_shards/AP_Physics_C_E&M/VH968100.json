After a chi-square test for association was conducted, the results indicated that the chi-square test statistic was 14.63 with a <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value of 0.2623.
