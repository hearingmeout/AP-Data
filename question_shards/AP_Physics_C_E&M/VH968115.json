    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Students in a high school statistics class wanted to see if the distribution of the colors of a popular candy was different in the bags for different types of candies the company manufactures. The students purchased several large bags of regular candies, tropical-flavored candies, and sour-flavored candies. For each type of candy, the students took a random sample of 100 candies and recorded how many of each color (red, green, yellow, or blue) were in the sample. The students verified the conditions for inference and calculated a chi-square test statistic of 12.59 with a corresponding <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value of 0.05.
