Foraging is the process of searching for food. To study such behavior, the scientists recorded the number of head movements per minute for a sample of 63 lizards. A 95 percent confidence interval constructed from the sample is given as <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2.7 plus or minus 0.62\"><math alttext=\"2.7 plus or minus 0.62\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2.7</mn><mo>±</mo><mn>0.62</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> head movements per minute.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the interval, is a claim of 3 head movements per minute plausible?</p>\n",
