She selected and analyzed a random sample of 40 different types of Brand A shoes and 33 different types of Brand B shoes. Alicia observes that the boxplot of the sample of Brand A shoe prices shows two outliers. Alicia wants to construct a confidence interval to estimate the difference in population means.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means approximately normal?</p>\n",
