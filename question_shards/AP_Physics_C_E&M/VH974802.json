The researchers wish to increase the reliability of their experimental observations before investigating new claims that chemotherapy-resistant tumors are an example of continuing evolution.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Of the following, which is the best next step the researchers might take to increase the reliability of their evidence?</p>\n",
