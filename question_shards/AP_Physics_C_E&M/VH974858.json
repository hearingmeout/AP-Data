    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A certain type of legal proceeding has three possible outcomes: in favor of party A, in favor of party B, or not in favor of either party. The outcomes are expected to be 40 percent, 20 percent, and 40 percent, respectively. A random sample of 40 cases is selected from a certain judge to investigate whether the judge’s outcomes are consistent with the expected outcomes. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test is conducted, and the value of the chi-square test statistic is <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"chi square equals 9.19\"><math alttext=\"chi square equals 9.19\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msup><mrow><mi>χ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>9.19</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> with a corresponding <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>–value of 0.01.
