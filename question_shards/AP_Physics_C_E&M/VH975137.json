Pigeons could accurately select the color of the plank of wood 20 percent of the time. A simulation was conducted in which a trial consisted of a pigeon being shown eight planks of wood and its number of successes being recorded. This process was repeated many times, and the results are shown in the histogram.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a histogram with 6 bars of data. The horizontal axis is labeled Number of Successes, and the numbers 0 through 8, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Probability, and the numbers 0 through 0.40, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. The data represented in the histogram are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Number of successes, 0; Probability, 0.16. Number of successes, 1; Probability, 0.34. Number of successes, 2; Probability, 0.29.
