The polling organization will investigate whether there are differences in how voters respond based on the highest level of education completed. The phone survey asked the voters contacted whether they approve or disapprove of the tax increase. The voters were also asked to indicate their highest level of education completed: high school, bachelor’s degree, or master’s degree.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the appropriate test to investigate whether there is an association between opinion about the ballot initiative and highest level of education completed?</p>\n",
