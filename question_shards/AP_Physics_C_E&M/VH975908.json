At the beginning of the program, 20 randomly selected retired individuals were invited to participate, and their times to walk a mile were recorded. After the six-week program, their times to walk a mile were again recorded. Most participants saw little to no improvement in their times to walk one mile; however, a few participants saw drastic improvements in their times to walk one mile. The program director would like to perform a hypothesis test to determine if the program reduces the mean time for retired individuals to walk a mile.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements is true?</p>\n",
