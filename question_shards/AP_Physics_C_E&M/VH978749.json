The loop is contained in a magnetic field B, which is directed downwards.

A current travels around the loop in a clockwise direction. In trial 1, the magnetic field is uniform and has magnitude <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> . In trial 2, the magnetic field is not uniform. It has magnitude <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> at the top of the loop and the magnitude increases steadily to a magnitude of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2 B\"><math alttext=\"2 B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> at the bottom of the loop. The students predict that, in both trials, the loop will rotate in the same direction and with the same magnitude of angular acceleration. After conducting the trials, the students observe that the loops do not rotate with the same angular acceleration. Which of the following explanations is correct about how the magnetic field affects the rotation in the loop when the results of the two trials are compared?</p>\n",
