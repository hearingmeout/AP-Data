Figure 1 shows a wire centered atop a block that is a dipole magnet. The north pole of the magnet is the block’s left side, and the south pole of the magnet is the block’s right side. The wire carries a current from left to right. The top view shows this wire running through the center of a rectangle, with the north pole on the left of the rectangle and the south pole on the right of the rectangle. Figure 1 shows a wire in parallel to and on top of a dipole magnet through the magnet’s horizontal axis of symmetry. The wire carries a current from left to right. The top view shows the left end of the dipole magnet is the north pole, and the right end is the south pole.\" height=\"95\" src=\"/images/babcca3411c25fe92f1e0f9e507ca3a2.png\" width=\"500\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In an experiment, a student lays a copper wire parallel to and on top of a dipole magnet, as shown in the figure. The student then allows a current to travel through the wire in the direction indicated in the figure. Which of the following claims is correct regarding the effect that the magnet has on the wire once the current flows through the circuit and provides appropriate reasoning?</p>\n",
