The diagram is separated into three layers: a factory with O 2 in the atmosphere, surface water, and bottom water. In the diagram, the process begins the factory and O 2 in the atmosphere. O2 in the atmosphere, and runoff and sewage from the factory, flow into the layer of surface water. The runoff and sewage can take either of two paths: it can flow downwards into the layer of bottom water, resulting in increased turbidity near aquatic plant life. It can also lead to eutrophication in the layer of surface water, resulting in an algal bloom. The algal bloom can take either of two paths: it can flow downwards into the bottom water via death and decay, feeding the decomposers in the bottom water resulting in high B O D, which results in reductions in harvestable fish. The algal bloom can also undergo photosynthesis while remaining in the layer of surface water.\" height=\"392\" src=\"/images/81d583f6836f763a1d3d0a442f746202.png\" width=\"565\"></div>\n",
