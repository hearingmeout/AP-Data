    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In a long‑term study of a population of gray squirrels, researchers observed that most of the squirrels had gray fur. However, there were some individuals in the population with white fur (albino). Genetic analysis revealed that the albino condition is expressed by individuals who are homozygous recessive <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"lowercase g lowercase g\"><math alttext=\"lowercase g lowercase g\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>g</mi><mi>g</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>. Over a ten-year period, the average frequency of albino squirrels in the population was 0.18. If the population is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the average frequency of the dominant allele is closest to which of the following?</p>\n",
