Scientists in Finland have been observing the tawny owl, a fairly large owl species that is commonly found in woodlands across much of Europe and Asia. Typically, the feathers of the upper body are either brown&nbsp;(<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"uppercase B uppercase B\"><math alttext=\"uppercase B uppercase B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>) or gray&nbsp;(<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"lowercase b lowercase b\"><math alttext=\"lowercase b lowercase b\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>b</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>).
