The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the years 1995 through 2014 are indicated. The vertical axis on the left is labeled Relative Application of Insecticides on Corn Crops, in kilograms per 10,000 meters squared. The vertical axis on the right is labeled B t Corn as Percent Total Corn Crop, and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 20, are indicated.&nbsp; Note, all data are approximate. The line representing B t Corn begins at 0 percent in 1996 and moves upward and to the right, reaching approximately 35 percent in 1999. The line then moves downward, dropping to approximately 20 percent in 2000. It then moves gradually upward and to the right, reaching approximately 60 percent in 2009, the line then moves horizontally to the right to 2012 and then moves up to approximately 78 percent in 2013. The line representing Insecticide begins more than halfway up the vertical axis in 1996. The line then moves gradually downward and to the right, crossing the line representing B t corn a little past 2003 as it moves more steeply downward, and ends near the horizontal axis in 2010.\" height=\"249\" src=\"/images/d5a2501e4e772988e47d48bc2cda4157.png\" width=\"500\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure&nbsp;1.
