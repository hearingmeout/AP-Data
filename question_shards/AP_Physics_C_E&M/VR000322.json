The researcher selects a random sample of visitors to the online store and records the time spent browsing and the total amount of their purchase. The researcher will conduct a <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for the slope of a regression line, where time spent browsing is the explanatory variable and total amount of purchase is the response variable.
