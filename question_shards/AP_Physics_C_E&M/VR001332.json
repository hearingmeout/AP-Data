      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">An increase in global temperatures causes an increase in kinetic energy, so chlorine atoms can break down ozone faster and more often in the troposphere.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Low temperatures in the stratosphere break down polar stratospheric clouds that release harmful chlorine containing compounds that break down ozone.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increase in carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere released from anthropogenic and natural sources break down ozone, creating ozone thinning over highly populated areas.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Low temperatures create polar stratospheric clouds that lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine, which result in the breakdown of ozone at the beginning of the antarctic spring.</p>",
