        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increase in calcium carbonate ions dissolved in the ocean water leads to an increase in the formation of coral reefs and increases the number of algae species that inhabit the reef systems.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increase in hydrogen ions dissolved in the ocean water sequesters available carbonate ions, preventing the use of calcium carbonate for coral skeleton formation.</p>",

      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increase in carbonic acid dissolved in the ocean water leads to increased deposition of calcium carbonate by coral species, leading to a bleaching of coral.</p>",
