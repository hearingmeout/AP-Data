During their study of the ecosystem, the biologist discovers that <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P C Bs\"><math alttext=\"P C Bs\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>PCBs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> are present in measurable levels in the water and wants to examine how <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P C Bs\"><math alttext=\"P C Bs\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>PCBs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> could vary in different trophic levels.
