      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Though all vertebrates produce prolactin, its varied uses indicate it arose as a result of convergent evolution and not as a result of common ancestry.</p>",
        "value": "i1"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Prolactin is a homologous hormone because it has a common origin but different functions in various species.</p>",
        "value": "i2"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Prolactin will bind only to intracellular receptors in animal species with phospholipid bilayers, so its effects are varied in different species.</p>",
        "value": "i3"
      },
      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Because of different receptors activating different signal transduction pathways within the same species, it is likely that prolactin production is a trait with highly selective pressure.</p>",
