An arrow points from Molecule A to Complex B that is represented as a large sphere plus two smaller spheres. A horizontal line with a perpendicular bar at its right end is positioned between Complex B and Molecule C to its immediate right. Molecule C is also represented as a sphere. An arrow points from Molecule C to the words Cell survival, growth and proliferation. Below the pathway, two arrows extend from a box labeled “Drug X” to Complex B. A note next to Drug X states “Drug X leads to activation of complex B.” Finally, an arrow points from a box labeled “Compound” to Molecule A.\" height=\"116\" src=\"/images/1930d8cdabf3cf2fab7dbfefee9c7955.png\" width=\"350\"></div>\n",
