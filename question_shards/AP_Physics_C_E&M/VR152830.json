      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The guppies might have no natural predators, which will result in a dramatic increase in the guppy population and an increase in competition for other native species.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The guppy population will likely evolve to consume another food source instead of the mosquito larvae.</p>",

      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The larvae will evolve a mechanism that will enable them to avoid predation from the guppies.</p>",
