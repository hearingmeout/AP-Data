The bottom horizontal branch of the circuit has a power supply and a resistor connected in series, with the power supply on the left. The top horizontal branch of the circuit is the coil of wire. A uniform magnetic field B is directed through the inside of the coil to the left edge of the page. A rectangular loop is placed inside the coil that carries a counterclockwise current I.\" src=\"/images/bf0b9077b6345d1fbb3717667b270502.svg\"></div></div>\n</div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A rectangular loop of wire with a counterclockwise current is inserted into the coil, as shown above, and released.
