The horizontal axis is labeled “Pumpkin Weight, in pounds,” and the numbers 6 through 22, in increments of 2, are indicated. The top box plot is labeled Farm A. The bottom box plot is labeled Farm B. Both box plots extend from 6 to 22. In Farm A, the box extends from 10.2 to 15.9. A vertical line segment at 12.5 divides the box into two parts. In Farm B, the box extends from 7.9 to 18.3. A vertical line segment at 9.8 divides the box into two parts.
