A large batch of white bread dough and a large batch of whole wheat bread dough were prepared. Each of the batches was formed into <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"18\"><math alttext=\"18\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>18</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>&nbsp;loaves, resulting in a total of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"36\"><math alttext=\"36\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>36</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>&nbsp;loaves. Each of the white bread loaves was randomly assigned to one of three baking temperatures (low, medium, and high), so that <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span> loaves were baked at the low temperature, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span> were baked at the medium temperature, and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span> were baked at the high temperature.
