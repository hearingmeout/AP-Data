The students in an AP Statistics class believe the rate is higher than <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span> percent. The students took a simple random sample of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"75\"><math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math></span></span> students from the school and asked, “Were you late to school today?” In their sample, <span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span> out of the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"75\"><math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math></span></span> students, or <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"8\"><math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math></span></span> percent of the sample, said they were late to school that day. The AP Statistics students conducted a simulation with <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"100\"><math alttext=\"100\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>100</mn></math></span></span> samples of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"75\"><math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math></span></span> students from a population where <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span> percent of students are late.
