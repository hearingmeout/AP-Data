      {
        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The eye cells move water against the concentration gradient, which is faster than moving water with the concentration gradient.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The eye cells have protein channels that allow water to pass through in greater quantities than the phospholipid bilayer allows.</p>",

        "label": "<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The eye cells modify water molecules so that they are positively charged, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer more easily than unmodified water molecules.</p>",
