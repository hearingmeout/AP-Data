One circuit has an ideal battery and the second circuit has a nonideal battery with the same <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"e m f\"><math alttext=\"e m f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>emf</mi></math></span></span> as the ideal battery. How does the nonideal battery affect the voltmeter reading, and what reasoning supports the claim?</p>\n",
