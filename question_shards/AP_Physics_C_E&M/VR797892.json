The spheres are on insulating stands that are initially a distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"d\"><math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math></span></span> from each other. The insulating stands are moved closer together so that the spheres briefly come into contact, and are then returned to their initial positions.
