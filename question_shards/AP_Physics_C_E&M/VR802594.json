The wire on the left carries current into the page, and the wires in the middle and on the right both carry current out of the page. The middle wire is equidistant from the other two wires. The direction of the current in the middle wire is then reversed. How does this affect the direction of the magnetic force exerted on the middle wire?</p>\n",
