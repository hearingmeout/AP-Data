    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An air-filled parallel-plate capacitor is connected to a battery. The space between the plates is then filled with a dielectric material, and the capacitor’s capacitance increases. Which of the following correctly explains how adding the dielectric increases the capacitance?</p>\n",

The superposition of the two fields is greater than the original plate field, so additional charge must move onto the plates. This increases the ratio of the plate charge to the potential difference.</p>",
