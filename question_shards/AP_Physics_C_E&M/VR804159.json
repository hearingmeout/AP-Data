From bottom to top, the left vertical branch has the battery with e m f script uppercase E, followed by the ammeter. The top horizontal edge is a nonideal wire. Moving to the right of the top edge and down the right side, the circuit splits into two vertical branches. The middle vertical branch has the resistor with resistance R. The rightmost vertical branch has the voltmeter.\" src=\"/images/4ce7f2442005ea6f99f77bf44c7b0175.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A group of students wish to determine the unknown resistance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"R\"><math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math></span></span> of a resistor. To do this, they have built the circuit shown in the figure. The students had to use a nonideal wire in one portion of the circuit, as indicated, but the remaining wires in the circuit are ideal, and the battery and two meters are ideal as well. The students then used the readings on the meters to calculate a value for the resistance. How does their calculated resistance value compare to the actual resistance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"R\"><math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math></span></span>, and what evidence or reasoning helps support the claim?</p>\n",
