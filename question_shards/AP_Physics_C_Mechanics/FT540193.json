    "prompt": "<p>A car is traveling along a straight, level road when it runs out of gas at time <em>t</em> = 0. From this time on, the net force on the car is a resistive force of –<em>k</em><strong>v</strong>, where <strong>v</strong> is velocity and <em>k</em> is a constant. Which of the following pairs of graphs best represents the speed <em>v</em> and position <em>x</em> of the car as functions of time after t = 0 ?</p>",
