The block is labeled Block 2.  The track is a straight line down and to the right.

Both tracks are frictionless, and both blocks make a smooth transition onto the rough horizontal surfaces. Block 1 comes to rest at a horizontal distance <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> from the bottom of the track. Which of the following best describes and explains the horizontal distance <em>d</em><sub>2</sub> that block 2 travels before coming to rest?</p>",
