The incident ball is shown as a filled circle above the floor on the left side of the figure with an arrow pointing down and to the right indicating the ball’s velocity. A straight dashed line extends from the end of the arrow to the floor where the ball will hit the floor, and this line makes an angle theta with the floor. A dashed circle above the floor on the right side of the figure shows the ball after it has collided with the floor, and an arrow pointing up and to the right indicated the direction of the ball’s velocity at this point. A dashed line extends the arrow back to the point where the ball collided with the floor, and this line makes an angle theta with the floor. A dashed vertical line representing the normal of the floor is drawn extending up from the point where the ball hit the floor.\" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"/images/9f0e9f3f035a0fbab9114194c928788d.png\" width=\"400\">\n<p>A 2 kg ball collides with the floor at an angle 𝜽 and rebounds at the same angle and speed as shown above.
