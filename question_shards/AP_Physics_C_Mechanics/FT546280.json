The board is a vertical rectangle, and the skater is represented by a dot to the left of the board a millimeter above the bottom edge of the board. An arrow straight to the right indicates the skater’s velocity, and a dashed line extended from this arrow shows where the skater will hit the board. \" height=\"159\" src=\"/images/eb04cecb9a49fbef0ee444e271906b57.png\" width=\"280\"></p>\n\n<p>A long board is free to slide on a sheet of frictionless ice. As shown in the top view above, a skater skates to the board and hops onto one end, causing the board to slide and rotate. In this situation, which of the following occurs?</p>\n",
