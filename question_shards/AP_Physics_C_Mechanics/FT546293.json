A string runs from mass 1 horizontally parallel to the table, over the pulley, and vertically down to the right of the surface. Another mass m sub 2 is attached to the lower end of the string. The string has tension T sub 1 in the horizontal section between mass 1 and the pulley, and tension T sub 2 in the vertical section between the pulley and mass 2. \" height=\"190\" src=\"/images/185e5d7ac616b3aec18d219d1b071324.png\" width=\"320\"></p>\n\n<p>Two blocks are joined by a light string that passes over the pulley shown above, which has radius <em>R</em> and moment of inertia <em>I</em> about its center. <em>T</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>T</em><sub>2</sub> are the tensions in the string on either side of the pulley and <em>𝛂</em> is the angular acceleration of the pulley.
