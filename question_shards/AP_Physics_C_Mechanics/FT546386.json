A point P is labeled on the vertical axis above the origin, and a horizontal line starts here. The line continues horizontally to the right until a point labeled Q, where it becomes decreasing and concave up until a point R which is still above the horizontal axis. It then becomes linearly decreasing until a point S below the horizontal axis. From point S it is linearly increasing until a point T which is above the horizontal axis, at a height that is below Q but above R. The line is then horizontal again until a point U on the right of the graph.\" height=\"140\" src=\"/images/9a9c2d3781b46ef844d0c05746702c1a.png\" width=\"310\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows velocity as a function of time for an object moving along a straight line.
