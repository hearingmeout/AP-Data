    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">To perform an experiment, students construct a pendulum by hanging a large solid metal sphere from a light string that is attached to the ceiling. A student pulls the sphere back to a small angle and releases the sphere from rest. Students measure the time it takes the sphere to swing back and forth ten times and then divide this time by ten to determine the period <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"T\"><math alttext=\"T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> of the pendulum. This experiment is conducted for several different lengths <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"L\"><math alttext=\"L\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> of the string. Which of the following graphs best represents the data for the experiment?</p>\n",
