The block sits on a flat horizontal surface. There are 2 marks indicated on the horizontal surface, x sub min is to the left of the block and x sub max is a good distance to the right of the block. In the graph, the horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled U sub s. 2 points are labeled on the horizontal axis, each the same distance from the vertical axis. The point labeled x sub min is on the horizontal axis to the left of the vertical axis and the point labeled x sub max is on the horizontal axis to the right of the vertical axis. A curve on the graph is a concave up parabola that begins to the left of the vertical axis high above the point x sub min and extends downward and to the right until it reaches its minimum at a point that is the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis. The curve then extends upward and to the right and ends high above the point x sub max.\" height=\"332\" src=\"/images/4ee55a09168d682fa2ba2f14458561a1.png\" width=\"370\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A block of mass <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M\"><math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is oscillating horizontally on the end of a spring between the points <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"x sub min\"><math alttext=\"x sub min\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>min</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"x sub max\"><math alttext=\"x sub max\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>max</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, as shown in the figure.
