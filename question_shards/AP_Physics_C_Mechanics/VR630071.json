The block slides down the ramp and then collides with and compresses a spring. Friction between the block and the ramp is negligible. A student claims that the kinetic energy of the block is the largest at the moment the block collides with the spring. Which of the following correctly identifies if the student’s claim is true or false, and provides correct justification?</p>\n",
