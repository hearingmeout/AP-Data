The block slides downward and to the right down the incline, then reaches the table and moves horizontally to the right a short distance, and then follows a curved trajectory downward and to the right from the table edge to the floor.\" src=\"/images/56d542f9f69e66b356725616e9fc4fe3.svg\"></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A block released from rest slides down a rough incline where there is noticeable friction between the block and the incline. At the bottom of the incline, the block slides off the table and then continues to move as a projectile. Which of the following defines a system, and correctly justifies the change of mechanical energy in that system from when the block is released to just before the block lands on the ground?</p>\n",
