Just after leaving the ramp, the bicycle’s wheels are rotating clockwise, as shown in the figure. While in the air, the cyclist applies the bicycle’s rear brake, stopping the rotation of the rear wheel. Which of the following indicates how the rest of the bicycle rotates, if at all, after the rear brake has been applied and provides a valid justification?</p>\n",
