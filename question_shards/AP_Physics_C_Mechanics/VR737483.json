Water is ejected horizontally from the launcher with a constant speed relative to the launcher. The mass of water ejected from the launcher over any time interval of length <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"delta t\"><math alttext=\"delta t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></math></span></span> is constant as well.
