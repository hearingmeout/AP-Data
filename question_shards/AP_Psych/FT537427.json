The lines start at the top edge of the square where they are grouped together towards the midpoint of the top square edge. The middle line, the sixth line from the left, starts at the midpoint of the top square edge and ends at the midpoint of the bottom square edge. Starting rom the left most line on the top edge of the square, the first 3 lines end on the left edge of the square, the next 5 lines end on the bottom edge of the square, and the last 3 lines end on the right edge of the square. The ends of the lines appear to have approximately the same spacing between them. \" src=\"/images/f6b8cfee161f4165a93989db57effb68.png\"></p><p>Which monocular depth cue is illustrated in the figure above?</p>",
