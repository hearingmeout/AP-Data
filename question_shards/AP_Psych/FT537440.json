The numbers from 1 to 12 appear along the horizontal axis in increments of 1 and the numbers from zero to 20 appear along the vertical axis in increments of 5. There are 9 data points on the graph that appear to be at the coordinates listed below. The line goes between the data points and begins in the upper left portion of the graph and slopes steeply downward at first and then as the graph moves to the right becomes less steep and eventually flattens out almost parallel with the horizontal axis. The data points appear to be as follows. Group size, 1; Amount of effort, 20. Group size, 1 point 5; Amount of effort, 14. Group size, 2 point five; Amount of effort, 14. Group size, 3; Amount of effort, 11 point 5. Group size 3 point 5; Amount of effort, 9 point 5. Group size 4 point 5; Amount of effort, 5. Group size, 7 point 5; Amount of effort, 9 point 5.
