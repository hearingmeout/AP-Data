    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a graph with the horizontal axis and a vertical axis, and two intersecting curves. The horizontal axis is labeled Arousal and the scale, from left to right, is Low to High. The vertical axis is labeled Performance Level and the scale, from bottom to top, is Low to High. There are two curves shown. One curve is labeled Difficult Tasks and is shown with a solid line. The second curve is labeled Easy Tasks and is shown with a dotted line. The difficult Tasks curve begins at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes and rises steeply upwards and has a maximum value at a low arousal and a high performance level. As Arousal increases, the curve slopes inward and then steeply downward and gently levels off as it meets the horizontal axis. The Easy Tasks curve begins at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis and moves along the horizontal axes at low arousal and then rises steeply upwards at the midpoint between low and high arousal. The Easy Task curve has a maximum value at high arousal and high performance levels. After a high arousal and a high performance levels, the curve slopes inward and then steeply downward and ends as it meets the horizontal axis. The two curves intersect when arousal is halfway between low and high arousal levels and performance is a little lower than halfway between low and high performance level. \" height=\"230\" src=\"/images/587073929a5ed41e1b6a0b4f2faddb76.png\" width=\"280\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above supports which of the following statements?</p>\n",
