A curve is drawn starting at the origin that is increasing and concave up, then becomes increasing and concave down until reaching a maximum, when it becomes decreasing and concave down, and finally decreasing and concave up until reaching the horizontal axis again. The maximum is to the right of the center of the horizontal axis. A vertical line is drawn from the horizontal axis to the maximum and it is labeled mode. Another vertical line is drawn to the left of the mode line from the horizontal axis to the curve and it is labeled median. A third vertical line is drawn to the left of the median line from the horizontal axis to the curve and it is labeled mean. The curve does not have left right symmetry, and the left side of the graph is less steep than the right side\" height=\"207\" src=\"/images/c6fc791071319b2618d5d5dfe99bc227.png\" width=\"270\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph depicts data from a test of general intelligence or <em>g</em>.
