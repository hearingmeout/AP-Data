Six tick marks appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled, one to six, in increments of one. Five tick marks appear on the vertical axis and are labeled, one to five, in increments of one. Two lines are graphed, a solid line representing Cheering and a dashed line representing Clapping. The solid line begins to the right of the vertical axis and above the dashed line, moves down and to the right, and passes through the approximate coordinate data as follows: Group Size, 1: Sound Pressure per Person, four point seven five. Group Size, 2: Sound Pressure per Person, three point two five. Group Size, 3: Sound Pressure per Person, three. Group Size, 4: Sound Pressure per Person, two point seven five. Group Size, 5: Sound Pressure per Person, two point five. Group Size, 6: Sound Pressure per Person, two point two five. The dashed line begins to the right of the vertical axis and below the solid line, moves down and to the right, and passes through the approximate coordinate data as follows: Group Size, 1: Sound Pressure per Person, two point nine. Group Size, 2: Sound Pressure per Person, one point nine. Group Size, 3: Sound Pressure per Person, one point seven five. Group Size, 4: Sound Pressure per Person, one point two five.
