Five numbers appear on the horizontal axis and are labeled from one to twenty, in increments of five. Five numbers appear on the vertical axis and are labeled from zero point two to one point zero, in increments of zero point two. There is one line on the graph, and it begins to the right of the vertical axis and slightly below a zero point six probability of recall. The line curves down and to the right, begins to level when the placement of the word in the list is between nine to fourteen at just below a zero point two probability of recall, then curves up and to the right when the placement of the word in the list is at fifteen, and ends beyond the twenty on the horizontal axis at approximately a zero point seven probability of recall. \" height=\"201\" src=\"/images/9a8703f4745c14f73f9a7f988be318df.png\" width=\"248\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph illustrates which of the following psychological concepts?</p>\n",
