Each diagram is a horizontal, double headed arrow labeled “Strength of Opinion.” Three equally spaced tick marks are drawn on each arrow. The leftmost tick mark is labeled “Against,” the rightmost tick mark is labeled “For,” and the middle tick mark is unlabeled. Each diagram has 8 shaded dots labeled “Group 1,” and 8 unshaded dots labeled “Group 2.” The top diagram is labeled “BEFORE GOUP DISCUSSION.” The 8 shaded dots, representing Group 1, are scattered across the left side of the diagram, beginning slightly to the right of the “Against” tick mark, and ending just before the middle tick mark. The circles are spread out at first, but start overlapping as they move closer to the middle tick mark. The 8 unshaded dots, representing Group 2, are scattered across the right side of the diagram, beginning slightly to the right of the middle tick mark, and ending slightly to the left of the “For” tick mark. The circles start by overlapping, but begin to spread out as they move closer to the “For” tick mark. The bottom diagram is labeled “AFTER GROUP DISCUSSION.” The 8 shaded dots, representing Group 1, are tightly packed and overlap on the left side of the diagram. They are centered between the “Against” tick mark and the middle tick mark. The 8 unshaded dots, representing Group 2, are tightly packed and overlap on the right side of the diagram.
