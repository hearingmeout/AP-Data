    "prompt": "<p><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three lines. The horizontal axis is labeled “Days,” and the numbers 0 through 15, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Average Number of Errors,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 2, are indicated. A solid line represents &quot;Group A: no food reward.&quot; A thicker solid line represents &quot;Group B: regularly rewarded.” And a dashed line represents “Group C: no food reward until day 11.” A vertical line labeled “Food Reward for Group C” is drawn from the top of the graph to the horizontal axis at 11 days. The data represented by each line is as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The solid line, representing “Group A: no food reward,” begins at 9 point 5 errors on day 1. It moves gradually downward and to the right, until it ends at 6 errors on day 17. The thicker solid line, representing “Group B: regularly rewarded,” begins at 9 point 5 errors on day 1. It moves steadily downward and to the right, until it ends at 2 point 5 errors on day 17. The dashed line, which represents “Group C: no food reward until day 11,” begins at 10 errors on day 1. It moves steadily downward and to the right, until it reaches day 11 and the vertical dashed line, labeled Food Reward for Group C. On day 11, 6 errors were made. The line then moves steeply downward and to the right, until it levels off at day 13 and ends at 1 error on day 17. \" src=\"/images/906a1d335d7ae248eaa472d39ed01bb2.jpg\"></p><p>The graph above depicts the results of an experiment in which rats learned to navigate a maze in one of three conditions.
