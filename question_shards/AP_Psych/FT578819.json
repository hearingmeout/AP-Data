The horizontal axis is labeled “Condition During Recall Testing.” The condition “Sad” is indicated at the left end of the horizontal axis, and the condition “Happy” is indicated at the right end of the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Percentage of Words Recalled During Testing,” and the numbers 40 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. One line represents participants who learned words in a sad mood, and the other line represents participants who learned words in a happy mood. The behavior of each line is as follows. For participants who learned words in a sad mood, the line begins just above 80 percent at the “Sad” condition. It moves downward and to the right until it ends just under 50 percent at the “Happy” condition. For participants who learned words in a happy mood, the line begins at just under 50 percent at the “Sad” condition. It moves upward and to the right until it ends just under 80 percent at the “Happy” condition. The two lines intersect approximately halfway along the horizontal axis, at approximately 65 percent.\" height=\"293\" src=\"/images/abd894d8a17e1deb50e35275de509c16.jpg\" width=\"500\"></p>\n\n<p>In an experiment, either a sad video or a happy video was shown to participants to influence their moods. The participants were then asked to memorize a list of words. Later, the participants were again shown either the same video they had seen before memorizing the words or they were shown the other video, and they were then asked to recall the words they had memorized previously. The results of the experiment, summarized in the chart above, best illustrate which psychological concept?</p>\n",
