In the diagram, five parts are labeled A through E. The main part of the eye consists of a large circle, which is surrounded by three thin layers. The inner layer is labeled D. The outer most layer curves outward to the left, forming a bump that spans most of the left side of the eye. This curved bump is labeled B. At the point where curved bump meets the circle, there are three shapes that are stacked on top of each other. The middle shape is a shaded oval, and is labeled A. The top and bottom shapes are identical, elongated pentagons. The shape at the top is labeled C. There is a thick tube on the right side of the eye. This tube consists of four thinner tubes. The outer two tubes are unshaded, and the inner two tubes are shaded. The inner tubes are labeled E.\" height=\"200\" src=\"/images/e602161c1c9bee6be3aec16f87884af8.png\" width=\"300\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Carrison views a movie in her home.
