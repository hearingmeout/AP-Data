    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Dr.&nbsp;Maisel is creating a new personality test. The test is a self-report measure in which participants answer questions on a scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” about how they would respond to particular situations. He then uses the responses to place participants along a spectrum in a number of different traits. He compares the results of the test to reports from the participants’ managers at work on their working styles and ability to work within their team and finds that the test results are highly positively correlated with managers’ reports. What type of test is he developing, and what type of validity or reliability can be determined from his work on the test?</p>\n",
