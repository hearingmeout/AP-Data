The horizontal axis is labeled “Place in List.” The leftmost point on the horizontal axis is labeled “Beginning,” and the rightmost point on the horizontal axis is labeled “End.” The vertical axis is labeled “Probability of Recall.” The bottom of the vertical axis is labeled “Low,” and the top of the vertical axis is labeled “High.” The curve begins about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis and is nearly level at first. It then begins to move downward and to the right until it reaches a valley just above the halfway point along the horizontal axis.
