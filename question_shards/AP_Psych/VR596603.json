    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Research has demonstrated that when participants in a study are shown a picture of a snake and a picture of a house, they are more likely to develop autonomic fear responses, such as increased sweating and heart rate, in response to the picture of the snake. It has also been found that fear responses to a picture of a house are quickly extinguished, whereas fear responses to a picture of a snake are maintained at a high level. These findings best support which of the following psychological perspectives?</p>\n",
