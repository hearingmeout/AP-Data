The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and no numbers are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Percent Retention,” and the numbers 20 through 100, in increments of 20, are indicated. The curve begins on the vertical axis at 100 and moves gradually downward and to the right, leveling off as it approaches the horizontal axis. It continues downward and becomes nearly horizontal as it ends at approximately 25 percent, just above the end of the horizontal axis.\" height=\"200\" src=\"/images/038adcbd85fc926376012b2f77fe5097.svg\" width=\"375\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph depicts which of the following phenomena?</p>\n",
