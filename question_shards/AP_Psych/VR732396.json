    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A professor conducts an experiment in which she asks college students to watch an hour-long educational video. The professor randomly assigns half of the students to receive ten points of extra credit for watching the video, while the other half of the students receive only one point. After watching the video, each student rates how interesting the video was on a scale of 1 to 100. The professor finds that the students who received one point rate the video as more interesting than those who received ten points. Which theory best explains these results?</p>\n",
