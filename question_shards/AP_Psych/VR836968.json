She randomly assigns half of a group of mice to get a lesion in one area of the brain. The other half does not get a lesion. Based on the following graph, where in the brain is the most likely site of the lesion?</p><div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a bar graph. The vertical axis is labeled “Accuracy,” and the numbers through 100, in increments of 20, are indicated. Two categories are indicated on the horizontal axis. Each category has one bar. The data represented by the bar are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Mice with a Lesion, 5. Mice without a Lesion, 100.\" src=\"/images/5d853f3904d09584ae620339db28fbfe.svg\"></div>\n",
