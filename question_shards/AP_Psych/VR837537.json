The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in milliseconds,” and the numbers 1 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Potential Difference, in millivolts,” and no numbers are indicated. There are two unlabeled horizontal dashed lines. The first is about one sixth of the way up the vertical axis, and the second is about two thirds of the way up the vertical axis. The portion of the curve from approximately 1.8 through 3.8 on the horizontal axis is circled. The curve begins on the first horizontal line, just before 1 millisecond. It moves steeply upward and to the right until it reaches a point high above the horizontal axis, about halfway between 1 and 2 milliseconds, above the second horizontal dashed line. In then moves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches a point just above the horizontal axis at approximately 2.2 seconds. It then moves gradually upward and to the right, reaching halfway between the horizontal axis and the first dashed line at 3 milliseconds, and reaching the first dashed line at about 3.8 milliseconds. From here it moves horizontally to the right until it ends at 4 milliseconds.\" src=\"/images/81017d9a9bb991ae6f41e177eedc05b0.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which psychological principle is represented in the area highlighted in the graph?</p>\n",
