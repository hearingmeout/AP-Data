The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and no numbers are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Membrane Potential, in millivolts,” and the numbers negative 105, negative 70, negative 35, 0, and 35 are indicated. A dashed horizontal line labeled “Threshold” is indicated at negative 50 millivolts. The curve begins at negative 70 millivolts on the vertical axis and moves horizontally to the right at first. About one third of the way along the horizontal axis, it moves steeply upward and to the right until it reaches 30 about halfway along the horizontal axis. It then moves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches approximately negative 90 about three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis. It then moves upward and to the right again for a short period of time before becoming horizontal again as it reaches negative 70 millivolts.\" src=\"/images/687b0da5eff0273569641eb7a7fc3364.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph depicts which of the following?</p>\n",
