The researchers also asked participants to rate their level of nasal congestion on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning no nasal congestion and 10 meaning complete blockage of airways with congestion. Which of the following is an appropriate conclusion to draw from the data presented in the scatterplot?</p>\n",
