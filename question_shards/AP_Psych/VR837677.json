An M value is given under each of the numbers on the axis. The M values negative 1.5 through 10.5, in increments of 2, are indicated form left to right, each beneath one of the numbers given on the horizontal axis. The bell curve begins at negative 3, M equals negative 1.5, on the horizontal axis and moves upward and to the right at an increasing rate. About halfway along the axis, the curve begins to level off and reaches a peak above the 0, M equals 4.5. It then moves downward and to the right at an increasing rate. As it approaches the horizontal axis, it begins to level off and ends on the at 3, M equals 10.5, on the horizontal axis.\" src=\"/images/c7dd1a0bff1db59a317eda3bf61a21ef.svg\">\n</div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A school collected data on student absences during stressful final exam periods when their sympathetic nervous systems would be activated.
