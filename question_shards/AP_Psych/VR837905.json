    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A researcher is interested in measuring adrenaline levels in male subjects and then comparing those levels to each participant’s corresponding level of aggression. The researcher takes blood samples from each male participant to identify their adrenaline levels, and then gives each participant a survey that measures aggression. The results of the study indicate that higher levels of adrenaline were associated with higher rates of aggression. Which of the following best describes why the researcher cannot report a causal relationship in this study?</p>\n",
