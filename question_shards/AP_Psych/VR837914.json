The diagram begins at Awake and remains at this line segment for a short period of time. It then quickly descends to a line segment labeled A. It then moves horizontally for a short period before descending to a line segment labeled B, where it moves horizontally for a short period of time. It then descends to a line segment labeled C, where it moves horizontally for a slightly longer period than line segments A and B. It then ascends back to line segment B, moves horizontally for a short period, then ascends to line segment D, which is at the same vertical position as line segment A. It moves horizontally for a very short period, then repeats this pattern twice; however, with each repetition, the length of line segment D gets significantly longer. After the second repetition, the diagram descends to line segment B for a longer period, which is approximately the same length as line segment D. It ascends to line segment D, where it moves horizontally for a longer period. It repeats this pattern once, then ascends back to Awake, where it ends.\" src=\"/images/be520032c6ccf02d699f5468885777c0.svg\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Using the diagram, during which of the following do individuals typically dream?</p>\n",
