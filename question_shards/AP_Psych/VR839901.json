    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">When studying for a vocabulary test, Catherine read one of her vocabulary words and its definition aloud several times. About twenty&nbsp;seconds later, she still remembered the word’s meaning, but then she moved on to the next word in the list without engaging in any further strategies to enhance her memory. The next day, she tested herself on the same vocabulary word at the same time, in the same mood, and in the same location as when she had first studied the word, but she could not remember its definition. It is most likely that Catherine could not remember the word because she failed to engage which of the following memory functions?</p>\n",
