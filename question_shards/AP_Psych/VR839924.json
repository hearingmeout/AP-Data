Group A was asked to memorize a list of 20 words that are all names of food items. Group B was asked to memorize a list of 20 random words, none of which were names of food items. A week later, Dr. Storck asked the participants to memorize a new list of 20 words, all of which were the names of different food items. He recorded how many words each group recalled accurately. The data he collected are shown in the graph.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best represents Dr. Storck’s likely hypothesis?</p>\n",
