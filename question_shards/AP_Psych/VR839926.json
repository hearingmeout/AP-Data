The vertical axis is labeled “Change in IQ Points,” and the numbers negative 5 through 40, in increments of 5, are indicated. There are four lines in the line graph. A key indicates that one line represents “Fullscale I Q,” one line represents “Crystallized I Q,” one line represents “Fluid I Q,” and one line represents “Spatial I Q.” All of the lines begin around 0 I Q points in 1908, and move generally upward and to the right. The Fullscale I Q line ends around 30 I Q points in 2012, the Crystalized I Q line ends around 20 I Q points in 2012, the Fluid I Q line ends around 37 I Q points in 2012, and the Spatial I Q line ends around 26 I Q points in 2012.\" src=\"/images/9664886ddaf7b5fc66d89919a5476d26.svg\">\n</div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The trend of IQ scores presented in the graph is most consistent with which of the following?</p>\n",
