Alumni were shown photographs of other individuals they graduated with. First, they were asked if they recognized the person in the photograph. Participants responded “yes” 75% of the time. Next, they were asked if they knew the person’s name. Participants could only correctly name the person in the photograph 25% of the time. Which of the following is the dependent variable in the recall condition?</p>\n",
