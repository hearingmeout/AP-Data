    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Dr. Lofter is a professor of cognitive psychology at a university. He has been collecting data from student performances on tests throughout the school year. Every other test is formatted as either a fill-in-the-blank test, which relies on recall, or a multiple-choice test, which relies more on recognition. At the end of the year, Dr Lofter publishes the research findings in a journal on cognitive sciences showing how students perform better on recognition tests than recall tests. Which of the following ethical violations did Dr. Lofter commit?</p>\n",
