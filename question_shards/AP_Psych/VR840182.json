    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Memory researchers want to determine if using a mnemonic device will prevent participants from forgetting information. They present a list of nonsense syllables to participants that have been randomly divided into two different groups. One group is instructed to use an assigned mnemonic device to remember the words while the other group is instructed to just try to recall the words without using any memory aid. Participants are then asked to recall the nonsense syllables after one hour, one day, and one week. Which of the following research designs best describes this research?</p>\n",
