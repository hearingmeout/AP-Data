    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Dr. Adedeji is trying to measure the capacity of her students’ short-term memories. She shows them a long series of numbers on a display for several seconds, and then has them write down as many numbers as they can remember in order. Dr. Adedeji has the students complete a survey in which she asks them “On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being highly effective, how well did you remember the numbers?” She concludes that her students have exceptionally good memories, as most of her students rated themselves as “highly effective.” Which of the following best explains Dr. Adedeji’s inaccurate conclusion?</p>\n",
