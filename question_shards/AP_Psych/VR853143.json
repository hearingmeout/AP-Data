    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Mr.&nbsp;Gregg wants to help his second-grade students improve their reading skills. He tests the students with 20&nbsp;reading comprehension questions at the beginning of the year. Every week throughout the year he gives the students 30&nbsp;minutes of reading comprehension tips. He tests the students at the end of the year with 20&nbsp;reading comprehension questions that are similar in difficulty to those on the original test. He finds that the students’ reading comprehension has increased and concludes that his tips worked. Which of the following describes the most significant problem with Mr.&nbsp;Gregg’s study?</p>\n",
