The horizontal axis is labeled “Type of Response by Group,” and the following three categories are indicated: verbal responses, cognitive responses, and emotional responses. Each category has two bars. A key indicates that one bar represents a nonviolent video game, and the other bar represents a violent video game. The data represented by the bars are as follows. Verbal responses. Nonviolent video game: 3. Violent video game: 4.8. Cognitive Responses. Nonviolent video game: 1.8. Violent video game: 2.5.&nbsp; Emotional Responses. Nonviolent video game: 5.5.

Afterward, they read a story about a car accident. The children were observed and their reactions to the story were documented. The researchers categorized the aggressive responses as verbal, cognitive, or emotional. According to the graphed results, which type of response was most frequently demonstrated by participants who played violent video games?</p>\n",
