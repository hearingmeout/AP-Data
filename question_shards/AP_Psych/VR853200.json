Children are randomly assigned to one of two groups. Children in Group A are shown simplified drawings of people (stick figures) wearing different types of clothing and are asked to sort these based on gender. Children in Group B are shown stick figure drawings of people performing various household tasks such as washing dishes, cooking, mowing a lawn, or fixing a leaky faucet. They are then asked to sort these drawings based on gender.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title_line passage-title\"></p></div>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows two groupings of drawings. Each group shows four stick figure drawings of people. In the first group, one person is wearing a dress, one person is wearing a short sleeve shirt and shorts, one person is wearing a long sleeve jacket and pants, and one person is wearing a short sleeve shirt and skirt. In the second group, one person is holding a bowl and a whisk, one person is washing dishes, one person is holding a wrench next to a leaking sink, and one person is pushing a lawn mower.\" src=\"/images/89bdd094fc7910cf6b3e19422558856e.svg\">\n</div>\n</div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the independent variable in this study?</p>\n",
