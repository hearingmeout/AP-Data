    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Researchers analyzed all-day recordings of caregiver-infant interactions at home in a random and representative sample of 100 families. Babies whose caregivers spent the most time speaking directly to them had a larger vocabulary at age two. However, the amount of speech that the babies indirectly heard, for example, by others in the home talking to one another was not related to increased vocabulary. Researchers concluded that the use of more speech directed at babies by caregivers created a larger vocabulary.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is an accurate statement about this study?</p>\n",
