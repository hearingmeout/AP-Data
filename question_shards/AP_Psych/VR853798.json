The horizontal axis is labeled “Age in Months,” and the numbers 3 through 21, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Motor Milestone.” Six horizontal bars are graphed in the plane. Error bars are given at each end of each bar. From bottom to top, the data represented by the bars are as follows. Bar 1. Sitting without support. 3.8 months to 9.2 months. The error bar on the left extends from 3.75 to 3.95, and the error bar on the right extends from 9 to 9.5. Bar 2. Standing with assistance. 5 months to 11.5 months. The error bar on the left extends from 4.9 to 5.1, and an error bar on the right extends from 11.2 to 11.9. Bar 3. Hand and knees crawling. 5.4 months to 13.6. The error bar on the left extends from 5.2 to 5.6, and the error bar on the right extends from 13.2 to 14.2. Bar 4. Walking with assistance. 6.4 months to 14 months. The error bar on the left extends from 6.2 to 6.6, and the error bar on the right extends from 13.5 to 14.5. Bar 5. Standing alone. 7 months to 17 months. The error bar on the left extends from 6.7 to 7.3, and the error bar on the right extends from 16.2 to 17.8. Bar 6. Walking alone. 8.5 months to 18 months.
