    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Dr. Arthur conducted a correlational study to determine the relationship between parental approval and preference for gender-congruent toys. She interviewed 40 sets of parents about the types of toys their child plays with and the parents’ preferences for these toys. Later, she interviewed each of the 92 children over the age of four about which toys they preferred. Dr. Arthur determined that there was a predicable relationship between the toys the children preferred and the toys the parents preferred.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is a variable of interest in this study?</p>\n",
