    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Researchers proposed a study on language acquisition to see if exposing 10-month-old babies to phonemes outside of their primary language had an impact on the child’s fluency in their primary language. One hundred babies are randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In one condition babies would only be exposed to phonemes of their primary language for one hour per day over the course of six months. The other group would be exposed to phonemes from several different languages for one hour per day over the course of six months. The researchers hoped to explore whether exposure to phonemes from several different languages helped or impeded language development.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following concerns would an IRB likely have about this study?</p>\n",
