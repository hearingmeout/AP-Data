    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A researcher explored the importance of comfort in newborn rhesus monkeys. The researcher separated infant monkeys from their biological mothers and introduced them to two inanimate surrogate mothers. One surrogate mother was constructed of wire and had a milk bottle attached to it, and the second was covered in soft cloth but did not have a milk bottle attached to it. The baby monkeys spent almost all of their time on the soft cloth mother and only went to the wire monkey to eat.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In this experiment, what is the dependent variable?</p>\n",
