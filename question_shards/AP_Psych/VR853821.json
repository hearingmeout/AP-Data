    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">To explore the concept of the “imaginary audience,” a researcher gave the Imaginary Audience Scale to 6th, 8th, and 10th graders who visited a local shopping mall during one weekend in June. The results indicated that students in 10th grade had the lowest ratings on the scale and concluded that the “imaginary audience” does not apply to students beyond the 8th grade. For the researcher to generalize this research, what would he need to do differently?</p>\n",
