The horizontal axis is labeled “Number of Stimulus Presentations,” and the number 1, followed by the numbers 5 through 20, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Amplitude of Response.” The curve begins near the top of the vertical axis at 1 stimulus presentation. It moves steeply downward and to the right, reaching a point one fifth of the way up the vertical axis at 5 stimulus presentations. As the curve approaches the horizontal axis, it levels off and continues nearly horizontally until it ends just above the horizontal axis at 20 stimulus presentations.\" height=\"202\" src=\"/images/4a982aee1c7ad151ad92a4def66d6192.svg\" width=\"300\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Research was conducted on the frequency of accidents involving construction workers being hit by construction vehicles in a work zone.
