The variable ratio line begins at the origin and slants steeply upward and to the right. The fixed ratio line begins to the right of the variable ratio line and slants steeply upward and to the right, but slightly less steeply than the variable ratio line. The variable internal line begins to the right of the fixed ratio line, and slants gradually upward and to the right. The fixed interval line begins to the right of the variable interval line, is composed of five curves, and generally slants gradually upward and to the right, less steeply than the variable interval line.\" src=\"/images/1057648f01b257bd4fa0df2e5cece578.svg\">\n</div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is an example of the schedule of reinforcement that has the slowest response rate as depicted in the graph?</p>\n",
