    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Dr. Wham decided to examine if students who receive encouragement will do better on exams. Dr. Wham’s colleague Dr. Heath teaches two classes, one at 10 am and one at 1 pm. Right before an exam in Dr. Heath’s 10 a.m. class, Dr. Wham tells Dr. Heath’s students the test is really hard, and he encourages them to try their hardest. For Dr. Heath’s 1 p.m. class, Dr. Wham does not talk to the students. He compares exam performance between the two classes and finds the 10 a.m. class did worse than the 1 p.m. class.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is an ethical flaw with Dr. Wham’s research?</p>\n",
