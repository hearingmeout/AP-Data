She shows her students various people’s faces and asks them to identify which of six emotional expressions is displayed. She records the accuracy of her students’ results in the graph. What of the following describes a theoretical perspective that best explains why there is a higher rate of accuracy for recognition of the emotional expressions of fear and anger?</p>\n",
