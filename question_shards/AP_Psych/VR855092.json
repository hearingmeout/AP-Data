The higher the scores on the survey, the more the students agree with the issues. During the term, students are given a reading assignment or video lecture about each issue at least twice, using studies sourced by reputable professional organizations. The data from these studies often contradicted the issues presented in the surveys. The surveys were given again at the end of the course to see if student attitudes about the social issues changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best explains the data from the table?</p>\n",
