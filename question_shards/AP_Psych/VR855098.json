It is common in Cheyenne’s family for the eldest womens’ opinions to be respected above all other factors.

Now, after her discussion with her mother and her aunt, she feels even more convinced about her decision to have the baby in the hospital.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which concept best explains Cheyenne’s desire to do what her aunt and mother suggest?</p>\n",
