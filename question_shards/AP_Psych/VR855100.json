They set up a table at a local shopping mall that displayed the products they were trying to sell. For three hours, they stopped people as they were shopping and gave them a flier with information about the facts and qualities of the products. Then, for an additional three hours, they had a local celebrity stand next to the table and stop people as they were shopping to tell them how much he likes the products. They kept track of how many products were sold during each three-hour period.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following ethical guidelines did the researchers fail to follow?</p>\n",
