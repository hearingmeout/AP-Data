    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Researchers wanted to see if people who were arguing would get along if they were in a dangerous situation together. Randomly selected participants were asked to complete a “demographic survey.” Each participant was seated in a room with another person, a research confederate, who was also filling out the survey. The confederate engaged in conversation with the participant, and during the course of the conversation, was instructed to disagree with the participant. After the disagreement went on for a few minutes, researchers pumped smoke into the room through the air vents and timed how long it took before participants stopped arguing and tried to leave.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which ethical consideration should the researchers follow at the conclusion of the study?</p>\n",
