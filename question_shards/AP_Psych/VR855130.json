However, the true purpose of the study was to expose subjects to a frustrating situation in which the personality inventory they are filling out keeps restarting and their information does not save. Subjects’ faces are closely monitored in the alone condition and in the with others condition to see whether subjects display more anger when alone or with others.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which ethical guideline does Dr. Yankovic need to follow at the conclusion of the study?</p>\n",
