She conducted a study in which she surveyed people in the military in five different nations about how comfortable they felt expressing six different basic emotions: happiness, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, and fear. In each of the nations, men were required to serve at least two years in the military when they turned 18, and women could volunteer to serve for two years when they turned 18. She randomly selected equal numbers of men and women from each nation to participate in the study.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is a confounding variable in this study?</p>\n",
