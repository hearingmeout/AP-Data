    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Dr. Mizrahi is designing a study to test whether antidepressants are more effective than placebos. Using electronic medical records, Dr. Mizrahi gathers a random sample of his patients who display a set of symptoms typically associated with major depressive disorder. He randomly assigns participants to receive an antidepressant medication or a placebo as a substitute for their daily multivitamin. Neither the participants nor Dr. Mizrahi know who is in which group.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following should be of concern when trying to evaluate whether Dr. Mizrahi adhered to established ethical research guidelines?</p>\n",
