To compare the mean number of lesions produced by two different strains of virus, one strain is applied to half of each of 8 tobacco leaves, and the other strain is applied to the other half of each leaf. The strain that goes on the right half of the leaf is decided by a coin flip. The lesions that appear on each half are then counted. The data are given below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with three columns. The first column is titled leaf and has values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
