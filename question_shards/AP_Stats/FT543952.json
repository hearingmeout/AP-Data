A curve is drawn starting on the horizontal axis around 20 where it is increasing and concave up. The curve has a point of inflection around 40 where it becomes increasing and concave down before reaching a maximum around 50. The curve then becomes decreasing and concave down before another point of inflection around 60 where it becomes decreasing and concave up before returning to the horizontal axis around 80.\" height=\"242\" src=\"/images/5bdde1a2ce59dd2daad8bcf6dc9a1de7.png\" width=\"302\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following is the best estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution shown in the figure above?</p>\n",
