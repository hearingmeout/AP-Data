    "prompt": "<p>An investigator was studying a territorial species of Central American termites, <em>Nasutitermes corniger</em>. Forty-nine termite pairs were randomly selected; both members of each of these pairs were from the same colony. Fifty-five additional termite pairs were randomly selected; the two members in each of these pairs were from different colonies. The pairs were placed in petri dishes and observed to see whether they exhibited aggressive behavior. The results are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with three columns labeled aggressive, nonaggressive, and total. The first row is for same colony and it has entries 40 open parentheses 33.5 close parentheses, 9 open parentheses 15.5 close parentheses, and 49. The second for is for different colonies and it has entries 31 open parentheses 37.5 close parentheses, 24 open parentheses 17.5 close parentheses, and 55. The third row is for total and it has entries 71, 33, and 104.\" height=\"124\" src=\"/images/6249e59e2e671ecc1fb3f50941cdd850.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n<p>A Chi-square test for homogeneity was conducted, resulting in <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 7.638.
