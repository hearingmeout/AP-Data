The lower plot is for male. The box goes from 10 to 29 with a vertical line at 20 dividing it into two areas. The horizontal line off the left end of the box extends to 5 and off the right end to 45. There are two asterisks plotted in line with these lines, one at 60 and one at 90. The upper plot is for female. The box goes from 8 to 17 with a vertical line at 15 dividing it into two areas.
