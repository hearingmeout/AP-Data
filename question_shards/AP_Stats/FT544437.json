    "prompt": "<p>The buyer for an electronics store wants to estimate the proportion of defective wireless game controllers in a shipment of 5,000 controllers from the store's primary supplier. The shipment consists of 200 boxes each containing 25 controllers. The buyer numbers the boxes from 1 to 200 and randomly selects six numbers in that range. She then opens the six boxes with the corresponding numbers, examines all 25 controllers in each of these boxes, and determines the proportion of the 150 controllers that are defective. What type of sample is this?</p>",
