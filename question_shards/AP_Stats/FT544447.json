    "prompt": "<p>A certain type of remote-control car has a fully charged battery at the time of purchase. The distribution of running times of cars of this type, before they require recharging of the battery for the first time after its period of initial use, is approximately normal with a mean of 80 minutes and a standard deviation of 2.5 minutes. The shaded area in the figure below represents which of the following probabilities?</p><p><img alt=\"A sketch of a graph is shown on a horizontal axis with seven evenly spaced tick marks. The curve starts on the horizontal axis at the left tick mark increasing and concave up, has a point of inflection around the third tick mark to become increasing and concave down, reaches a maximum at the fourth tick mark to become decreasing and concave down, has another point of inflection around the fifth tick mark to become decreasing and concave up, and reaches the horizontal axis again at the seventh tick mark. The fourth tick mark under the maximum is labeled mu. The second tick mark is labeled mu minus 2 times sigma and there is a vertical line from this point to the curve. The fifth tick mark is labeled mu plus sigma and there is a vertical line from this point to the curve. The area under the curve, above the axis, and between these two lines is shaded grey.\" src=\"/images/65bb44940947691cf2bff7103c2ca371.png\"></p>",
