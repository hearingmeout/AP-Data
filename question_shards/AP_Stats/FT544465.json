    "prompt": "Publishers of a magazine wish to determine what proportion of the magazine's 50,000 subscribers are pleased with their subscription. The publishers intend to mail a survey to 1,000 subscribers randomly selected from those who have received the magazine for 5 years or more. This introduces selection bias, since long-subscribing customers are more likely to be pleased with their subscription. Which of the following would best eliminate selection bias?",
