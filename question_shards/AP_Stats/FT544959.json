She randomly selected 100 students who completed the program. Data collected on these students are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with columns showing whether someone has completed more advanced study and rows showing whether people have completed the most popular health sciences certificate program. The first column and row are yes, the second column and row are no, and the third column and row are total. The first row reads 35, 25, and 60. The second row reads 5, 35, and 40.
