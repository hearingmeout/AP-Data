    "prompt": "<p>On their birthdays, employees at a large company are permitted to take a 60-minute lunch break instead of the usual 30 minutes. Data were obtained from 10 randomly selected company employees on the amount of time that each actually took for lunch on his or her birthday. The company wishes to investigate whether these data provide convincing evidence that the mean time is greater than 60 minutes. Of the following, which information would NOT be expected to be a part of the process of correctly conducting a hypothesis test to investigate the question, at the 0.05 level of significance?</p>",
