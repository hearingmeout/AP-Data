    "prompt": "<p>A randomized experiment was performed to determine whether two fertilizers, A and B, give different yields of tomatoes. A total of 33 tomato plants were grown; 16 using fertilizer A, and 17 using fertilizer B. The distributions of the data did not show marked skewness and there were no outliers in either data set. The results of the experiment are shown below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with two columns, fertilizer A on the left and fertilizer B on the right. The first row is for average number of tomatoes per plant and has values 19.54 and 23.39. The second row is for standard deviation and has values 3.68 and 4.93. The third row is for number of plants and has values 16 and 17.\" height=\"138\" src=\"/images/898f6365f6e2c866987c866969308eb2.png\" width=\"480\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following statements best describes the conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment?</p>\n",
