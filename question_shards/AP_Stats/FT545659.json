The title reads response variable is Zinc in ppm. A table is shown with five columns labeled variable, coefficient, standard deviation, T, and P. The first row reads constant, 16.3, 4.90, 3.32, and 0.003. The second row reads lead in ppm, 19, 1.89, 10.01, and 0. At the bottom it reads S equals 16.17 and R squared equals 82 percent.\" height=\"144\" src=\"/images/cf95081b5d4f2dbbd2fa3ba993f1c4e2.png\" width=\"377\"></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the value 19.0 in the output?</p>\n",
