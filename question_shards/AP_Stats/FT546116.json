The consultant shows pictures of rooms decorated with three different color scheme to each person in a random sample of 110 men and to each person in a random sample of 90 women. The consultant asks each person to choose his or her favorite color scheme. A chi-square test for homogeneity of proportions will be used to test the consultant’s hypothesis. Assuming that the conditions for inference are met, which of the following statements is true for the test?</p>",
