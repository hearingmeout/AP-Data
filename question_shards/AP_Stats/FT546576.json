The horizontal axis is labeled Test scores, and the tick marks appearing, from left to right, are 15, 20, 25, and 30. The first boxplot is labeled Section one. The left whisker extends from approximately 17 to 18; the box extends from approximately 18 to 21, a vertical line segment at 20 breaks the box into 2 parts; and the right whisker extends from approximately 21 to 23 point 5. The second boxplot is labeled Section 2. There is a plus sign at approximately 15, and another at approximately 23 point 5. The left whisker extends from approximately 25 point 5 to 29; the box extends from approximately 29 to 31, a vertical line segment at 30 breaks the box into 2 parts; and the right whisker extends from approximately 31 to 33. The third boxplot is labeled Section 3. The left whisker extends from approximately 17 to 21; the box extends from approximately 21 to 26, a vertical line segment at approximately 24 breaks the box into 2 parts; and the right whisker extends from approximately 26 to 28. There is a plus sign at approximately 31. \" height=\"255\" src=\"/images/10f90f7a45ea1c163ed4637e6ec8df88.png\" width=\"335\"></p>\n\n<p>Professor James gave the same test to his three sections of statistics students. On the 35-question test, the highest score was 32 and the lowest was 15. Based on the information displayed in the boxplots above, which of the following statements is true?</p>\n",
