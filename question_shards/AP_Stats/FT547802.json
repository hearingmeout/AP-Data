The newspaper staff will collect data from a random sample of restaurants in the city and estimate the mean price using a 90 percent confidence interval. In past years, the standard deviation has always been very close to $35. Assuming that the population standard deviation is $35, which of the following is the minimum sample size needed to obtain a margin of error of no more than $5 ?</p>",
