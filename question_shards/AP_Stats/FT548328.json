    "prompt": "<p>In a certain school, students can choose whether to eat in the school’s cafeteria. A reporter working for the school’s newspaper polled students on their reactions to changes in the menu at the cafeteria. For each student leaving the cafeteria in one 30-minute time period, the reporter used a coin to determine whether to stop the student and ask how he or she felt about the new menu. In the reporter’s article it was stated that a random sample of the students showed that 89 percent of the school’s student population was happy with the new menu. Which of the following statements is true?</p>",
