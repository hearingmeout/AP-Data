The sodium contents, in milligrams (mg) per serving, of the chips are summarized in the boxplots below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a boxplot with boxes for Regular Chips and Healthy Chips, with Regular Chips above Healthy Chips. The horizontal axis is labeled Sodium Content in m g and has evenly spaced tick marks numbered from 75 to 300, in increments of 25. The box for Regular Chips starts at about 145 and ends at about 210, with a vertical bar at 175. The whisker on the left side extends from about 105 to the box, and the whisker on the right side extends from the box to about 300. The box for Healthy Chips starts at about 120 and ends at about 220, with a vertical bar at 200.
