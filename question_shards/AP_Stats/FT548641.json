The numbers from 0 through 12 appear along the horizontal axis from left to right. The numbers zero through 16, in increments of 2, appear along the vertical axis from bottom to top. The numbers along the horizontal axis are centered under each bar. The bar heights are as follows, from left to right: Bar at zero: 7. Bar at 1: 12. Bar at 2: 14. Bar at 3: 12. Bar at 4: 10. Bar at 5: 9. Bar at 6: 7. Bar at 7: 3. Bar at 8: 2. Bar at 9: 2. Bar at 10: 1. Bar at 11: There is no bar.
