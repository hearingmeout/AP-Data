    "prompt": "In the states of Florida and Colorado, veterinarians investigating obesity in dogs obtained random samples of pet medical records and recorded the weights of the dogs in the samples. A test was conducted of H<sub>0</sub> : <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> versus H<sub>a</sub> : <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> ≠ <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, where <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> represents the proportion of all overweight dogs in Florida and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> represents the proportion of all overweight dogs in Colorado. The resulting test statistic for a two-sample <em>z</em>-test for a difference between proportions was 1.85. At the significance level <em>α</em>  = 0.05, which of the following is a correct conclusion?",
