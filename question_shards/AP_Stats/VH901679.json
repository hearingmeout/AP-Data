The box plot is described as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The bottom whisker extends from $0 through $250. The box extends from $250 through $900, and a horizontal line at $500 breaks the box into two unequal parts. The top whisker extends from $900 through $1,600. Three separate points are indicated at approximately $2,900, $4,800, and $5,200.\" height=\"199\" src=\"/images/c0b28dd187ef45e3d014d1e3fb74847f.png\" width=\"160\"></div>\n",
