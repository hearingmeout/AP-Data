Shalise completed a small puzzle in 75 minutes and a large jigsaw puzzle in 140 minutes. For all participants, the distribution of completion time for the small puzzle was approximately normal with mean 60 minutes and standard deviation 15 minutes. The distribution of completion time for the large puzzle was approximately normal with mean 180 minutes and standard deviation 40 minutes.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Approximately what percent of the participants had finishing times greater than Shalise’s for each puzzle?</p>\n",
