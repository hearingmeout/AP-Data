    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A certain county school district has 15 high schools. The high school seniors’ plans after graduation in each school vary greatly from one school to the next. The county superintendent will select a sample of high school seniors from the district to survey about their plans after graduation. The superintendent will use a cluster sample with the high schools as clusters. A random sample of 5 high schools will be selected, and all seniors at those high schools will complete the survey. What is one disadvantage to selecting a cluster sample to investigate the superintendent’s goal?</p>\n",
