The plants in Group 1 will receive the current fertilizer, Fertilizer A, and the plants in Group 2 will receive a new fertilizer, Fertilizer B. All other growing conditions, including amount of sunlight and water, will be kept the same for the two groups. The growth of the pepper plants will be compared for the two groups.
