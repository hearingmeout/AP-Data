The following scatterplot shows trade-in value and mileage for those cars. Five of the points are labeled A, B, C, D, and E, respectively.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot in the coordinate plane with 11 data points, several of which are labeled with the letters A through E. The vertical axis is labeled Miles Driven, in thousands, and the numbers 50 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Value, and the numbers 4000 dollars through 6500 dollars, in increments of 500, are indicated. The values represented by the data points are as follows.
