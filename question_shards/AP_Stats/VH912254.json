The horizontal axis is labeled Amount Spent on Order, and the amounts, 0 dollars through 60 dollars, in increments of 10 dollars, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Residual, and the numbers negative 15 through 15, in increments of 5, are indicated. A horizontal line is drawn on the vertical axis at 0. There are approximately 41 data points, and about half of them are scattered above the line representing residual 0, and about half of them are scattered below the line representing residual 0.&nbsp; The cluster of data points begins at $10. To start, the data points are tightly scattered between residuals negative 5 and 5. Moving to the right, at $35 the data points become more loosely scattered between residuals negative 10 and 10. The cluster of data points ends at $50, at which the data points are even more loosely scattered between residuals negative 15 and 15.\" height=\"253\" src=\"/images/182247d57464d62739f1312f0101790d.png\" width=\"400\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the residual plot, which condition for inference for the slope of the regression line does <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">not</span> appear to be satisfied?</p>\n",
