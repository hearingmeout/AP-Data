    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The owner of a plant nursery will conduct a study to investigate whether a new fertilizer is more effective than an older fertilizer in helping the growth of young tomato seedlings. The owner selects a simple random sample of 50 young tomato seedlings from all the young tomato seedlings in the nursery. Half of the selected seedlings will be randomly assigned to receive the new fertilizer, and the remaining seedlings will receive the older fertilizer. The growth of the seedlings will be recorded for the next month. What is the main reason in the study for selecting a simple random sample from the population?</p>\n",
