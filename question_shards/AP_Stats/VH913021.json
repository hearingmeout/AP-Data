One of the variables of interest in the survey was the age of the farmer. The following bar chart shows the responses of the farmers, classified by age-group, regarding their willingness to participate.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a segmented bar chart. The horizontal axis is labeled Age Group, in years, and the following four categories are indicated: 44 or Younger, 45 through 54, 55 through 64, and 65 or Older. The vertical axis is labeled Relative Frequency, and the numbers 0 through 1.00, in increments of 0.25, are indicated. Each category on the horizontal axis has one bar that is divided into two segments. One segment represents Yes, and the other segment represents No. For each bar, the segments add up to 1.00. The data, presented by bar, are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Age Group, 44 or Younger. Yes, 0.70. No, 0.30. Age Group, 45 through 54. Yes, 0.60. No, 0.40. Age Group, 55 through 64. Yes, 0.55. No, 0.45. Age Group, 65 or Older. Yes, 0.30.
