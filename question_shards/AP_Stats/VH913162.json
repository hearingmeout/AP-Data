Partial-cut harvesting is increasingly used to lessen the effects of logging on the animals. The following scatterplot shows the relationship between the density of red squirrels, in squirrels per plot, 2 to 4 years after partial-cut harvesting, and the percent of trees that were harvested in each of 11 forests.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot in the coordinate plane with 11 data points. The horizontal axis is labeled Percent of Trees Harvested, and the numbers 0 through 70, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Squirrels per Plot, and the numbers 4 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The data points represented in the scatterplot are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The data points are: 0 comma 18, 0 comma 14.5, 10 comma 12.5, 30 comma 10, 32 comma 13, 38 comma 9, 42 comma 9.5, 50 comma 12, 51 comma 10, 54 comma 5.5, and 63 comma 7.5.&nbsp; &nbsp;\" height=\"236\" src=\"/images/3c43bc5c01f8e08c95c48f25b08c21bc.png\" width=\"300\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the best description of the relationship displayed in the scatterplot?</p>\n",
