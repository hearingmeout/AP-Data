    "prompt": "<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Mateo plays on his school basketball team. From past history, he knows that his probability of making a basket on a free throw is 0.8. Suppose he wants to create a simulation using random numbers to estimate the probability of making at least 3 baskets on his next 5 free throw attempts. Which of the following assignments of the digits 0 to 9 could be used for the simulation?</p>\n",
