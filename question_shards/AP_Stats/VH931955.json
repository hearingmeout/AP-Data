The department conducted a simulation of 1,000 trials to estimate the probabilities that a certain number of callers out of the next 10 callers will have to wait more than 8 minutes to have their calls answered. The simulation is shown in the following histogram.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a histogram with 8 bars of data. The horizontal axis is labeled Number of Callers, and the numbers 0 through 7, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Relative Frequency, and the numbers 0 through 0.35, in increments of 0.05, are indicated. The data represented in the histogram are as follows. Number of callers, 0; Relative frequency, 0.181. Number of callers, 1; Relative frequency, 0.345. Number of callers, 2; Relative frequency, 0.284. Number of callers, 3; Relative frequency, 0.142. Number of callers, 4; Relative frequency, 0.039. Number of callers, 5; Relative frequency, 0.008. Number of callers, 6; Relative frequency, 0.
