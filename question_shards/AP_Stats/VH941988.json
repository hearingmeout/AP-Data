The number of defective parts produced by each machine is about 1 percent. Suppose two independent random samples, each of size 100, are selected, where one is a sample of parts produced by machine A and the other is a sample of parts produced by machine B. Which of the following is true about the sampling distribution of the difference in the sample proportions of defective parts?</p></div></div></div></div>\n",
