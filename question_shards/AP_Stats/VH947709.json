The president randomly selected 30 members and surveyed the selected members on their grant-writing experience. Of the 30 selected members, 12 indicated that they did have the experience. Have the conditions for inference with a one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"z\"><math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval been met?</p>\n",
