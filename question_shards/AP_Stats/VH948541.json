The difference between the sample proportion of defective parts made on the old assembly line and the sample proportion of defective parts made on the new assembly line (old minus new) was 0.006. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis being the proportion of defective parts made on the old assembly line is greater than that of the new assembly line. The <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value of the test was 0.018.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value?</p>\n",
