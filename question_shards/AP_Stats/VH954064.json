To test the belief, the scientist randomly selected 1,250 adults in the United States. The sample proportion of adults who watch 15 or fewer hours of television per week was 0.28, and the resulting hypothesis test had a <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value of 0.061.
