The selected members were asked to report the number of miles they traveled on their last vacation. The mean and standard deviation of the responses were 150 miles and 40 miles, respectively. A graph of the sample data displayed a right skew. The association will construct a confidence interval to estimate the mean number of miles traveled for all members.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Have the conditions for inference been met?</p>\n",
