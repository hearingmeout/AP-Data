Researchers studied a liquid repellent designed to reduce such damage. A sample of 20 wooden blocks of the same size were treated with the repellent and left outside in an area where porcupines are known to live. After a certain amount of time, the blocks were inspected for the number of porcupine teeth marks visible. The data were used to create the 95&nbsp;percent confidence interval <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"4.9 comma 5.8\"><math alttext=\"4.9 comma 5.8\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>4.9</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>⁢</mo><mn>5.8</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following claims is supported by the interval?</p>\n",
