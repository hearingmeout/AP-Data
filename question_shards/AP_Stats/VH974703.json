For entry-level positions, the company claims that 50&nbsp;percent get a basic audit, 30&nbsp;percent get an enhanced audit, and 20&nbsp;percent get a complete audit. The company tests this hypothesis using a random sample and finds <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"chi square equals 0.771\"><math alttext=\"chi square equals 0.771\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msup><mrow><mi>χ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.771</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> with a corresponding <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>–value of 0.68.
