They know that most customers have zero payouts and a few have substantial payouts. The consumer group collects a random sample of 18 customers and computes a mean payout per claim of $579.80 with a standard deviation of $751.30.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Is it appropriate for the consumer group to perform a hypothesis test for the mean payout of all customers?</p>\n",
