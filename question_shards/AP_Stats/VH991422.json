She randomly selects 24 used Model X cars for sale. For each used car, she records the car’s selling price (in dollars) and age (in years). She computes a 96 percent confidence interval to estimate the slope of the regression line relating the age of a used Model X car to its selling price. The resulting confidence interval is given by <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"negative 5,556 comma negative 3,157\"><math alttext=\"negative 5,556 comma negative 3,157\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>5</mn><mtext>,</mtext><mn>556</mn><mo>⁢</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3</mn><mtext>,</mtext><mn>157</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that the conditions for inference on the slope of the regression equation are met.
