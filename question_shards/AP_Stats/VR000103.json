The jeweler selected a random sample of diamonds with the same cut and quality and recorded the weight and market price of each diamond. Which of the following residual plots provides evidence that the condition that there is a linear relationship between weight and market price has <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">not</span> been met?</p>\n",
