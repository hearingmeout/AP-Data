    "prompt": "<p>“Women leave their families to marry, and the husband is&nbsp;the master of the household they marry into. . . . The husband is to be firm, the wife soft; conjugal affections follow from this. While at home, the two of you should treat each other with the formality and reserve of a guest. Listen carefully to and obey whatever your husband tells you. If he does something wrong, gently correct him. Don’t be like those women who not only do not correct their husbands but actually lead them into indecent ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Wife of a Tang dynasty official</p>\n\n<p>The excerpt above best illustrates&nbsp;which of the following attributes of Confucianism?</p>\n",
