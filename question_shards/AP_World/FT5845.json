Yet even this status is surrounded with galling restrictions, such as being forbidden to grow European crops, or to store products which are royal monopolies, or to establish factories of a type the Peninsula itself does not possess. To this add the exclusive trading privileges, even in articles of prime necessity, and the barriers between American provinces, designed to prevent all exchange of trade, traffic, and understanding.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\" style=\"margin-left: 640px;\">Simón Bolívar, <em>Jamaica Letter</em>, 1815</p>\n\n<p>The quotation above best supports which of the following conclusions about the author’s motives for resistance to Spanish colonial rule in Latin America?</p>\n",
