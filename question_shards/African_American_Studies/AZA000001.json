    "description": "“We are in perfect accord on the matter of [forming a Negro Baptist Publishing Company].... \nAlthough we note with pleasure that the Negro...has made wonderful progress in the higher branches of education, it is a lamentableregrettable; unfortunate fact that some of the ablest scholars of the race have been forced to occupy very menial positions, because there is such little organization among our people that they are not willing to [allow us to support] their genius and learning.... If we stop educating, we go backward toward slavery and eternal obscurity.... We must encourage education by creating establishments for the employment of scholarship.... If the large army of Baptist young people...are not encouraged to bookmaking, clerkships, ... and management by us, whitherwhere shall they go as they come forth from the colleges and universities...?\nIf the scholars and workers of our race find that they are the sponsors of a great concern like [the Negro Baptist Publishing Company], nothing else will so inspire them to make master strokes for the race.... \nThe solution of the so-called race problem will depend in a large measure upon what we prove able to do for ourselves.”\nSource: Speech by Reverend Elias Camp Morris, president of the National Baptist Convention, an association of Black churches, at a meeting of the Convention in Washington, D.C., 1893",
