    "description": "“[After a slaving raid in West Africa] the invaders then pinionedshackled the prisoners of all ages and sexes indiscriminately, took their flocksherd of animals and all their effects, and moved on their way towards the sea [on the West African coast].... Having come to the next tribe, the enemy laid siege and immediately took men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects. They then went on to the next district which was contiguous to the sea, called in Africa, Anamaboo. The enemies’ provisions were then almost spent, as well as their strength. The inhabitants [of Anamaboo] knowing what conduct they had pursued, and what were their present intentions, improved the favorable opportunity, attacked them, and took [the] enemy, prisoners, flocks and all their effects. I was then taken a second time. All of us were then put into the castle [by the people of Anamaboo], and kept for market. On a certain time I and other prisoners were put on board a canoe, under our master, and rowed away to a vessel belonging to Rhode Island [in British North America], commanded by Captain Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford. While we were going to the vessel, our master told us all to appear to the best possible advantage for sale. I was bought on board by one Robert Mumford, steward of said vessel, for four gallons of rum, and a piece of calicocotton cloth, and called Venture, on account of his having purchased me with his own private ventureinvestment. Thus I came by my name. All the slaves that were bought for that vessel's cargo, were two hundred and sixty.”\nSource: Venture Smith, formerly enslaved African, A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa, 1798",
