    "description": "“Queen mothers often exercised considerable power. They helped enthrone and depose1 rulers...presided over court systems, and exercised state power in other ways....\nA main avenue through which individual women exercised state power was by ruling, although most rulers of the period were men. Among the Mossi people of West Africa there was a legendary warrior queen, Iyennegi, who...is reported to have led a strong army in defense of Mossi lands....\nDuring the early seventeenth century, a royal woman, Njinga...consolidated her power in the 1620s in the area of present-day Angola but was forced, due to Portuguese incursions, to move further eastward to Matamba. There she created woman-based rituals of state power and was able...to bequeath power to her sister. Njinga is heralded as a strong woman ruler and a heroine....\nWomen also exercised power through various roles in the state and community...they often held political offices that corresponded with those of men in a dual-sex political system.... In addition...women...were appointed to committees that provided checks and balances on the rulers’ power in centralized states or adjudicated2 important societal disputes among decentralized groups.”\nSource: Cheryl Johnson-Odim, Women and Gender in the History of Sub-Saharan Africa, 20071:to remove↩\n2:to make a formal judgment or decision about a problem↩",
