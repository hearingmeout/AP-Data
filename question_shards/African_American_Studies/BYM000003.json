    "description": "Romare Bearden, Collage, The Black American in Search of His Identity, 1969\n\nThe collage consists of 3 main elements:\n\nOn the left is a highly stylized profile view of a face.\n\nThe face is created from smaller photographs generally showing Black people involved in protests.\n\nThe face features a large oval eye looking up and a prominent mouth and chin.\n\nIn the center is a large hand holding a paintbrush.\n\nOn the right is half of an African mask of Queen Idia’s face.\n\nThe mask appears to be carved from ivory.\n\nThe mask features an empty eye topped by scars, a strong nose and mouth, and elaborately carved curling hair.\n\n© Romare Bearden Foundation / Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY; Courtesy of Michael Rosenfeld Gallery LLC, New York, NY",
