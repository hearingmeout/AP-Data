    "description": "“The Qadisjudge who interprets and administers the law and jurists of Timbuktu sent the Muezzinman who calls Muslims to prayer Yahma to greet the pasha, man of high rank or officebut...the Yahma did not offer the pasha the least hospitality. The pasha was extremely annoyed by his reception.... \nThe Moroccans entered the city of Timbuktu on Thursday, May 30, 1591. They covered the city in all directions.... \nWhen the Moroccan army arrived...it found one of the countries that God had favored most in wealth and fertility. Peace and security reigned everywhere in all the provinces.... \nEverything changed at that moment. Danger took the place of security, misery replaced opulence.... People destroyed each other on all sides, in all places, and in all directions. There was...war....\nThese troubles endlessly continued and increased. [However, in the past, when the Songhai emperor was on the throne], no chief of any region dared attack the sovereigns of the land (Songhai), because God had dispensed so much vigor, audacity, courage, and majesty to their force...as has been seen in the recitationaction of repeating something aloud from memory of the history of Songhai.” \nSource: Abd-Al-Rahman Al-Sadi, description of the invasion of Songhai by Moroccans from northern Africa during the decline of the empire in the late 1500s",
