    "description": "“To your excellencies the Chiefs in council...my friends and brothers...\n\nBeing in possession of a few Black people...I debased myself and took one of my black women by the name of Daull, by her I have had these children named as follows, the oldest Elizabeth about the age of seventeen, the next John about the age of eleven, the next Polly about the age of even years. These [are] the only Children I have...and as the time I may be called on to die is uncertain, my desire is to have them as free citizens of this nationCherokee citizenship was traditionally inherited from the mother, so Tuskingo’s children were not automatically eligible to receive it.. Knowing what property I may have, is to be divided amongst the best of my friends [after I die], how can I think [of my children, the] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh to be called their property...and for them and their offspring for generations yet unborn, is a thought of too great a magnitude for me to remain silent any longer. I therefore humbly petition... for their freedom.”\n\nSource: Tuskingo “Shoe Boots,” military commander from the Cherokee Nation, petition to the General Council of the Cherokee, 1824",
