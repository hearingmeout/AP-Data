    "description": "“The Prince of the Believers, Askiya Muhammad, then asked the sayyidArabic title of respect to be his messenger to the Sultan of Mossiregion of West Africa near present-day Burkina Faso. The sayyid accepted this mission. He went to the land of Mossi and submitted the letter of his master, summoning the sultan to embrace Islam.\nThe Sultan of Mossi unwittingly declared that he first wanted to consult his ancestors in the other world. Consequently, accompanied by his ministers, he went to the temple of the idolimage or representation of a god of the land. The sayyid went along in order to see how one went about consulting the dead. First, the customary offerings were made. Then a very old man appeared. At the sight of him everyone lay prostrateflat on the ground and face down, and the sultan announced the object of his journey. Answering in the name of the ancestors, the old man said, ‘I will never accept such a thing for you. On the contrary, you must fight to the last man until either you or they have fallen.’\nThen the Sultan answered the blessed sayyid. ‘Return to your master and tell him that between him and us there can never be other than struggles and war.’” \nSource: Abd-Al-Rahman Al-Sadi, Muslim historian from Timbuktu, “Songhai and the Moroccan Invasion,” Circa 1650",
