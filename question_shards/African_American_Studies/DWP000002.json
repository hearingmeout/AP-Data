Bourgoin, The Maroons in Ambush on the Dromilly Estate in the Parish of Trelawney, Jamaica, print of maroons ambushing British soldiers in Jamaica, 1801\n\nPainting titled The Maroons in Ambush on the Dromilly Estate in the Parish of Trelawney, Jamaica. The maroons are armed and shown hiding behind trees in a forest preparing to ambush British soldiers who are marching toward them.\n\nSlavery Images: A Visual Record of the African Slave Trade and Slave Life in the Early African Diaspora\n\nSource 2\n“[By the 1820s] maroons had kept the Dismal Swamp region [in Virginia and North Carolina] in a state of near-constant rebellion for decades. There was no question in many enslavers’ minds that their escaping property was endeavoring to reach the Great Dismal Swamp. Their fears were widely published in runaway ads. An understanding developed that some maroons sought scissionseparation from the outside world, while others were engaged in guerrilla warfare. Even those maroons who were not actively engaging with enslavers were doing comparable damage to the proslavery gospel that held African Americans incapable of survival outside of white oversight and as benefiting from and appreciative of their enslavement. That growing numbers of maroons were doing just fine on their own in the most inaccessible wilderness in America, arming themselves and even stockpiling weapons to turn against those who would enslave them, inspired terror.”\nSource: J.
