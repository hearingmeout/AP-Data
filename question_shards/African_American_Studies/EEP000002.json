    "description": "“When Ibn Battutaa North African traveler first visited Cairo in 1326, he undoubtedly heard about the visit of Mansa Musa (King of Mali from 1307 to 1332). Mansa Musa had passed through the city two years earlier making his pilgrimage to Mecca with thousands of slaves and soldiers, wives and officials. One hundred camels each carried one hundred pounds of gold. Mansa Musa performed many acts of charity and ‘flooded Cairo with his kindness.’ So much gold spent in the markets of Cairo actually upset the gold market well into the next century. Mali's gold was important all over the world. In the later Medieval period, West Africa may have been producing almost two-thirds of the world's supply of gold! Mali also supplied other trade items—ivory, ostrich feathers, kola nuts, hides, and slaves. No wonder there was talk about the Kingdom of Mali and its riches! And no wonder Ibn Battuta, still restless after his trip to Al-Andaluspresent-day Spain and Portugal, set his mind on visiting the sub-Saharan kingdom.”\nSource: Nick Bartel, “Journey to Mali: 1350-1351,” Office of Resources for International and Area Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 1999",
