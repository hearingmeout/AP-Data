    "description": "“Many causes have been assigned for the three days of race rioting, from July 27 to 30 in Chicago, each touching some particular phase of the general condition that led up to the outbreak.... A background of strained race relations brought to a head more rapidly through political corruption, economic competition and clashes due to the overflow of the greatly increased colored population into sections outside of the so-called ‘Black Belt,’...where only a spark was needed to ignite the flames of racial antagonism. That spark was contributed by a white youth when he knocked a colored lad off a raft at the 29th Street bathing beach and the colored boy was drowned.\nFour weeks spent in studying the situation in Chicago...seem to show at least eight general causes for the riots, and the same conditions, to a greater or less degree, can be found in almost every large city with an appreciable Negro population. These causes, taken after a careful study in order of their prominence, are:\n\nRace Prejudice. \n\nEconomic Competition. \n\nPolitical Corruption and Exploitation of Negro Voters. \n\nPolice Inefficiency. \n\nNewspaper Lies about Negro Crime. \n\nUnpunished Crimes Against Negroes. \n\nHousing. \n\nReaction of Whites and Negroes from War.”\nSource: Walter White, assistant executive secretary of the NAACP, “Chicago and Its Eight Reasons,\" article published by the NAACP, a civil rights organization headquartered in New York, in their magazine The Crisis, 1919",
