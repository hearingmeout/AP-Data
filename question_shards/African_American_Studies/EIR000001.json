    "description": "Source 1\n“Women promoted self-respect through their organizations and clubs, churches, political movements, modeling agencies, beauty shops, and fashion shows. Photographs of women involved in civic and social clubs were also popular during this time and many were published on the society pages of black newspapers and magazines, as were advertising images for black hair and skin care companies. The result was a new visualization of the black woman. No longer seen only as laborers, black women were depicted as they wanted to be seen—as church leaders, educators, businesswomen, and models. Photographs of women during this time offer a vision of self-expression, self-determination, and assertiveness.”\nSource: Deborah Willis, essay titled “Harlem Seen” in Harlem: A Century in Images, 2010 \n\nSource 2Meharry Medical College is Champion of the South, 1910\nLibrary of Congress",
