As I am married and a resident of this city, where I have always lived; and also as I went with the Marqués...[Cortés] to discover the islands which are in that part of the southern sea [the Pacific] where there was much hunger and privationthe act of depriving someone of something; and also as I went to discover and pacify the islands of...Puerto Rico; and also as I went on the pacification and conquest of the island of Cuba with...Diego Velázquez; in all these ways for thirty years have I served and continue to serve Your Majesty—for these reasons stated above do I petition Your Mercy. And also because I was the first to have the inspiration to sow maize here in New Spain and to see if it took; I did this and experimented at my own expense.”\nSource: Juan Garrido, Petition to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, 1538\n\nSource 2\n“Other sources produce a similar litany of incidents that add up to overwhelming evidence of the black presence in the Peruvian Conquest. The first four non-natives to see the Inca capital of Cuzco in 1533 included a black man.... During Manco Inca’s [Incan ruler] 1536 siege of Cuzco, blacks labored to extinguish the fires on the roof of the royal palace.... A force sent from [the island of] Hispaniola to relieve the defenders included 200 Africans with military experience—a veritable squadron of black conquistadors.”\nSource: Matthew Restall, historian, Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest, 2003",
