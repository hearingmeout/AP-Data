Its three great mosques, Djingareyber, Sankoré and Sidi Yahia, recall Timbuktu's golden age.... \n\nFounded in the fifth century, the economic and cultural apogee1 of Timbuktu came about during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It was an important centre for the diffusion of Islamic culture with the University of Sankoré, with...25,000 students. It was also a crossroads and an important market place where the trading of manuscripts was negotiated, and...gold was sold.... \n\nThe mosques and holy places of Timbuktu have played an essential role in the spread of Islam in Africa at an early period; the three great mosques of Timbuktu...bear witness to the golden age of the intellectual and spiritual capital at the end of the Askia dynasty; and the three mosques and mausoleums are outstanding witnesses to the urban establishment of Timbuktu, its important role of commercial, spiritual and cultural centre on the southern trans-Saharan trading route, and its traditional characteristic construction techniques.”\n\nSource: “Timbuktu: Home of Sankoré University,” Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, published in 2016\n\n1:highest point↩",
