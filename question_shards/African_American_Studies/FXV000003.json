    "description": "“PERSPECTIVES\nBlack Studies is fundamentally transdisciplinaryrelating to more than one branch of knowledge. It is grounded in a range of traditional disciplines within the social sciences, humanities research, and natural and physical sciences. It exists not as a negotiation between or at the intersection of multiple coexisting disciplines, but as a separate yet integrated discipline concerned with questions that both encompassinclude and transcendgo beyond the individual fields, yielding areas of discoveries that offer unique research models, fresh synthesescombinations of ideas, theoretical frameworks, methods, and insights applied to rigorous interrogation of all of human existence. It is an expansive, inclusive field of study.\nFurther, Black scholars have defined, articulated, and elaborated legitimate areas of scholarship, circumventinggoing around the restrictions of narrowly defined disciplines. The innovations of Black Studies research provide distinctive angles and critical perspectives from which facts and experiences are analyzed, presented, and written about.”\nSource: Jacqueline Bobo, Cynthia Hudley, and Claudine Michel, The Black Studies Reader, 2004",
