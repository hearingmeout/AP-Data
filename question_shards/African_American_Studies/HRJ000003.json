    "description": "“One of the most shocking things to realize about Reconstruction is how painfully short it was, compared to the dreadfully long duration of slavery.... It was clearly on the road to ending by [1873]...and suffered a devastating political blow...with the Compromise of 1877.... \nThe process of Reconstruction involved nothing less than the monumental effort to create a biracial democracy out of the wreckage of the rebellion. Though that effort ultimately was thwarted, Reconstruction saw the passage of a vast array of legislation aimed at transforming the status of the formerly enslaved....\nOver time, the federal military occupation that enabled the nation’s bold experiment...lost support among the cost-conscious and war-weary parts of the political and economic leadership in the North.... Year after year, election after election, the counterrevolution led by white Southern Democrats only intensified.... Eventually [Southern state] governments...would bring the African American people to...‘the nadir’—the rock-bottom lowest point in American race relations.”\nSource: Henry Louis Gates, Jr., scholar, Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow, 2019",
