    "description": "The Slave Auction\nThe sale began—young girls were there,\nDefenseless in their wretchedness,\nWhose stifled sobs of deep despair\nRevealed their anguish and distress.\n\nAnd mothers stood with streaming eyes,\nAnd saw their dearest children sold;\nUnheeded rose their bitter cries,\nWhile tyrants bartered them for gold.\n\nAnd woman, with her love and truth—\nFor these in sableblack forms may dwell—\nGaz'd on the husband of her youth,\nWith anguish none may paint or tell.\n\nAnd men, whose sole crime was their hue,\nThe impress of their maker's hand,\nAnd frail and shrinking children, too,\nWere gathered in that mournful band.\n\nYe who have laid your love to rest,\nAnd wept above their lifeless claybody,\nKnow not the anguish of that breast,\nWhose lov'd are rudely torn away.\n\nYe may not know how desolate\nAre bosoms rudely forced to part,\nAnd how a dull and heavy weight\nWill press the life-drops from the heart.\n\nFrances Ellen Watkins Harper, free African American poet and social activist, poem published in 1854",
