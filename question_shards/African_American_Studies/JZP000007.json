    "description": "“Black Studies, as a socially engaged field of scholarly inquiry, is the progeny1 of centuries of research that seeks to redress long-standing misconceptions of Black inferiority, African heritage, and cultural significance. As early as the nineteenth century, groundbreaking volumes containing radical reinterpretations of Black history were published....  \nHistoric social justice movements...led to fundamental alterations in...institutions of higher learning. The first contemporary initiatives toward the establishment of Black Studies programs on college campuses were ignited at Merritt Junior College in Oakland, California, in 1963.... Between 1968 and 1975 over five hundred academic units (programs and departments) offering Black Studies courses were in place across the country.... Black students and other students of color...challenged mainstream scholarly discourse.”\nSource: Jacqueline Bobo, Cynthia Hudley, and Claudine Michel, editors, “Introduction,” The Black Studies Reader, 20041:result, offspring↩",
