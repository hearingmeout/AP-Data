Johnson and Malinda Murphy, 1874\nCollection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of Louis Moran and Douglas Van Dine \n\nSource 2\n“WANTED.\nInformation of the present whereabouts of my two children Albert and Margaret Carpenter, who were sold away from me in the town of Madison Court House, Va., and taken by slave-traders to the Cotton States, several years before the breaking out of the late rebellion. \nAt the time the boy was only nine and the girl eight years of age. I was told that one Dick Mulhundro sold my daughter to a Georgian planter. I never knew what became of my son; I trust in God that this notice may in some way restore these dear ones to my arms again. A letter addressed to me in the care of my son William Stewart, Hamilton, Ohio would reach my hands by my last marriage. My name was changed to Lucinda Keys, Hamilton Ohio.”\nSource: Advertisement placed by Lucinda Keys in The Christian Recorder, a periodical published by the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church,  1877.",
