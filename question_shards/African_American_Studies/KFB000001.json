    "description": "Source 1Gopher John, a Black Seminole Leader and Interpreter, 1863\nSchomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division, The New York Public Library. \n\nSource 2\n“From the late eighteenth century through the end of the U.S. Civil War, Choctaw and ChickasawTwo of the five large Indigenous nations men and women held people of African descent in slavery. Like their white southern counterparts, Indians bought, sold, owned, and exploited black people’s labor and reproduction for economic and social gain. Choctaws and Chickasaws purchased slaves—men, women, and children—to work on their Mississippi farms and plantations and to serve in their homes. Slaveholders and those who did not own slaves embraced a racial ideology that affirmed black people’s inherent difference and inferiority and thus justified their enslavement.... Enslaved people cleared and plowed fields, hauled logs, drained swamps, planted and harvested crops, drove wagons, built homes, wove fabric, sewed clothes, cooked meals, and cared for Indian children, all for their masters’ benefit.”\nFrom BLACK SLAVES, INDIAN MASTERS: SLAVERY, EMANCIPATION, AND CITIZENSHIP IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN SOUTH by Barbara Krauthamer.
