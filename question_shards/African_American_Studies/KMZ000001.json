    "description": "“Never will the chains of slavery and ignorance burst till we become united as one and cultivate among ourselves the pure principles of piety, morality, and virtue.... I am sensible of exposing myself to calumnymisrepresentation and reproach; but shall I, for fear of feeble man,...hold my peace? Shall I, for fear of scoffs and frowns, refrain my tongue? Ah, no!.... O ye daughters of Africa, awake! awake! arise! no longer sleep nor slumber, but distinguish yourselves..... What examples have ye set before the rising generation?.... O, woman, woman, would thou only strive to excel in merit and virtue; would thou only store thy mind with useful knowledge, great would be thine influence.... You are not too far advanced [in age] to instill these principles into the minds of your tender infants....\nHow long shall the fair daughters of Africa be compelled to bury their minds and talents beneath a load of iron pots and kettles?.... We have never had an opportunity of displaying our talents; therefore the world thinks we know nothing.... Do you ask the dispositioncharacter I would have you possess? Possess the spirit of independence. The Americans do, and why should not you? Possess the spirit of men, bold and enterprising, fearless and undaunted. Sue for your rights and privileges.”\nSource: Maria W. Stewart, Religion and the Pure Principles of Morality, the Sure Foundation on Which We Must Build, 1831",
