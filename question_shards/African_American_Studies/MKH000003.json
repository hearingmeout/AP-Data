    "description": "“The first to receive baptism in the country were the Count of Soyo [uncle of the King of Kongo] and his son, who were baptized on Christmas Day of the year 1491.... A great many people...followed the example of their princes...[b]ut even though the majority of these [Africans] outwardly profess to be Christians, the greater number are still idolatrousworship of a physical object as a god in their hearts and secretly worship false gods, tigers, leopards, and wolves, imagining that in this way they will escape feeling the effects of their fury....[T]hey all have two strings in their bows—the Catholic religion and paganismnon-Christian spiritual beliefs, and when the saints do not answer their prayers, they invoke the fetishesobjects believed to have supernatural power. Yet to see them all covered with crosses and rosariesa string of beads used in Roman Catholic prayer one would take them for sanctimonioushypocritically devout people. When the Count of Soyo goes to mass, he dresses himself superbly and wears golden chains and collars of coral. He marches pompously to the sound of drums and horns, surrounded by guards among whom there are five or six musketeers who fire from time to time and others who carry flags and are followed by a great crowd of people.” \nSource: Olfert Dapper, Dutch geographer, “The Kingdom of Congo,” Description of Africa, published in Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1686",
