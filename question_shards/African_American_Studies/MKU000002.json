    "description": "“Until the students of the white race give the same attention to the study of Africa which they have given to the study of the history of Europe and Asia, they will be unprepared to reach any conclusions as to the sort of civilization which the Negro race has produced and its relative value. The fact is that the white man is still ignorant as to what has taken place in Africa.... Because the whites of modern times succeeded in finding in Africa slaves for exploitation at the time when the country was torn to pieces by wars of migrating hordes, they have concluded that these weak captives in war, whom they enslaved and debased, must be taken as a sample of what the Negro is capable of. Yet if the Negroes of this country are to serve as an indication of the capabilities of the race, it is both unscientific and unjust to expect the Negroes to pass through two hundred and fifty years of slavery and in three generations achieve as much as the whites have during many centuries. If they could, instead of thereby showing that they are equal to the whites, they would demonstrate their superiority.\nTo disabuse the public mind of this slander proceeding from ill-designing investigators, C. G. Woodson organized the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in Chicago in 1915, hoping to save and publish the records of the Negro, that the race may not become a negligible factor in the thought of the world. The work of this Association is to collect sociological and historical data, to publish books on Negro life and history, to promote studies in this field through schools and clubs with a view to bringing about harmony between the races by interpreting the one to the other.”\nSource: Carter G.
