    "description": "“There have been known to exist, for several years, settlements of runaway negroes...amongst the mountains and swamps [of Brazil].... \nThe sites of these encampments appear to be carefully chosen to guard against a surprise attack.\nThe fugitives are said to be industrious in the cultivation of rice..and Indian corn, and in the manufacture of charcoal. They make canoes and...small sailing vessels, which are used for the interior trade. They carry on a traffic with the inferior class of tradesmen in the neighboring towns, exchanging the produce of their labour for certain necessaries, such as gunpowder and shot, cloth and soap.... Some of them are frequently known to venture into [Belém] at night, where they have occasionally been taken and claimed by their owners, who endeavor to sell them, but find generally much difficulty in doing so, the freedom of their wandering life unfitting them for slavery.\nThe situation of these encampments being naturally difficult of access, and the connivanceassistance afforded the fugitives by parties trading with them, have rendered the repeated attempts to capture them abortiveunsuccessful.”\nSource: Report to the British government by a British diplomatic representative in Belém, a city in northern Brazil, 1854",
