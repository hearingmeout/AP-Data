    "description": "“If any thing has ever been proved and demonstrated again and again, it is THE LAWFULNESS OF SLAVERY....\nIt has been proved that the [Latin] maxim, ‘partus sequitur ventrem’ – or that the offspring inherits the status of the parent, is a law of nature, reason, religion, and providence, and that no man has any rights but those to which he is born, or which belong to that condition in which God places him by the hand of his providence....\nHe that is born a slave, therefore, has no right to liberty, and can acquire none, so long as the right of his master to his service stands in the way.”\nSource: Elwood Fisher, Virginia-born, white resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, “Lecture on the North and the South,” delivered in Cincinnati, January 1849",
