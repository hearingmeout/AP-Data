    "description": "“I grew up like a neglected weed,—ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it. Then I was not happy or contented: every time I saw a white man I was afraid of being carried away. I had two sisters carried away in a chain-gang,—one of them left two children. We were always uneasy. Now I've been free, I know what a dreadful condition slavery is. I have seen hundreds of escaped slaves, but I never saw one who was willing to go back and be a slave. I have no opportunity to see my friends in my native land“Native land” refers to Maryland in the United States, where Harriet Tubman was formerly enslaved.. We would rather stay [there], if we could be as free there as we are here. I think slavery is the next thing to hell.” \nSource: Harriet Tubman, testimony as compiled in Benjamin Drew's A North-Side View of Slavery, 1856",
