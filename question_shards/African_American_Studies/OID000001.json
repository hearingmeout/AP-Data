In the light of this, the lack of awareness of present-day Spaniards about the presence of Africans in Spanish history is remarkable, particularly as Spain most probably had the largest black population in Renaissance Europe (Martín Casares 2005). Regardless of the fact that black Africans have been a significant element in the Spanish population for centuries, their importance has never been recognized.”\nSource: Aurelia Martín-Casares and Marga G.
