    "description": "“I was born May 1815, of a slave mother, in Shelby County, Kentucky, and was claimed as the property of David White Esq. He came into possession of my mother long before I was born....\nMy mother was known by the name of Milldred Jackson. She is the mother of seven slaves only, all being sons, of whom I am the eldest. She was also so fortunate or unfortunate, as to have some of what is called the slaveholding blood flowing in her veins. I know not how much; but not enough to prevent her children though fathered by slaveholders, from being bought and sold in the slave markets of the South. It is almost impossible for slaves to give a correct account of their male parentage. All that I know about it is, that my mother informed me that my father’s name was James Bibb. He was doubtless one of the present Bibb family of Kentucky;The Bibb family was a prominent white family in nineteenth century Kentucky, whose members included James Bibb (the author’s father), a Kentucky state senator, and George Bibb, a United States senator from Kentucky. but I have no personal knowledge of him at all, for he, died before my recollection.”\n\nHenry Bibb, Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Henry Bibb, An American Slave, Written by Himself, book published in 1849.",
