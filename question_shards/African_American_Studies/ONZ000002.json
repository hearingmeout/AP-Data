    "description": "“Not only do white men but also colored men forget the facts of the Negro’s double environment. The Negro American has for his environment not only the white surrounding world, but also, and touching him usually much more nearly and compellingly, is the environment furnished by his own colored group. There are exceptions, of course, but this is the rule. The American Negro, therefore, is surrounded and conditioned by the concept which he has of white people and he is treated in accordance with the concept they have of him. On the other hand, so far as his own people are concerned, he is in direct contact with individuals and facts.”\nSource: W.E.B. Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn; an Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept, 1940",
