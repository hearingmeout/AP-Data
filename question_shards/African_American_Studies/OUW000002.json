    "description": "“...We sailed for fifteen days and came to Mogadishu, which is an enormous town. Its inhabitants are merchants...When a ship reaches the port, it is met by...small boats, in each of which are a number of young men, each carrying a [gift]. He presents this to one of the merchants on the ship saying \"This is my guest,\" and all the others do the same. Each merchant on disembarking goes only to the house of the young man who is his host...The host then sells his goods for him and buys for him...\nWe stayed there three days...on the fourth day...we went to the mosquea Muslim place of worship and prayed...\nWe left Mogadishu...with the object of visiting the town of Kilwa in the land of the Zanj.\n[Along the way,] we came to Mombasa, a large island...They have fruit trees on the island, but no cereals, which have to be brought to them...Their food consists chiefly of bananas and fish. The inhabitants are pious, honorable, and upright, and they have well-built wooden mosques.\nWe stayed one night in Mombasa, and then continued to Kilwa, which is a large town on the coast. The majority of its inhabitants are Zanj, jet-black in color, and with tattoo marks on their faces... \nThe sultana title for a ruler...was noted for his gifts and generosity...as is prescribed in the Koranthe sacred book of Islam...” \n\nSource: Description of the Swahili Coast of Africa from Ibn Battuta’s travel journal, 1355.
