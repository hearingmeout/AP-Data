    "description": "Emancipation\n\nFling out your banners, your honors be bringing,\n\nStrike every chord and let music be ringing!\n\nCelebrate freely this day of all days.\n\nFew are the years since that notable blessing,\n\nRaised you from slaves to the powers of men.\n\nEach year has seen you my brothers progressing,\n\nNever to sink to that level again....\n\nPress boldly forward nor waver, nor falter.\n\nBlood has been freely poured out in your cause,\n\nLives sacrificed upon Liberty’s altar.\n\nPress to the front, it were craven to pause....\n\nUp! Men and brothers, be noble, be earnest!\n\nRipe is the time and success is assured;\n\nKnow that your fate was the hardest and sternest\n\nWhen through those lash-ringing days you endured.\n\nNever again shall the manacles1 gall2 you\n\nNever again shall the whip stroke defame!\n\nNobles and Freemen, your destinies call you\n\nOnward to honor, to glory and fame.\n\nSource: Paul Laurence Dunbar, 1890\n\n1:chains or shackles↩\n\n2:to irritate↩",
