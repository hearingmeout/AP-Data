Men and brothers, be noble, be earnest!\n\nRipe is the time and success is assured;\n\nKnow that your fate was the hardest and sternest\n\nWhen through those lash-ringing days you endured.\n\nNever again shall the manacles1 gall2 you\n\nNever again shall the whip stroke defame!\n\nNobles and Freemen, your destinies call you\n\nOnward to honor, to glory and fame.\n\nSource: Paul Laurence Dunbar, 1890\n\n1:chains or shackles↩\n\n2:to irritate↩",
