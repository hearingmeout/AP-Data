The people inhabiting the island formerly called St. Domingo, hereby agree to form themselves into a free state sovereign and independent of any other power in the universe, under the name of empire of Hayti.\n2. Slavery is forever abolished.\n3. The Citizens of Hayti are brothers at home; equality in the eyes of the law is incontestably acknowledged, and there cannot exist any titles, advantages, or privileges, other than those necessarily resulting from the consideration and reward of services rendered to liberty and independence.\n4. The law is the same to all, whether it punishes, or whether it protects.\n\nSource: English translation of the Constitution of Haiti, published in the New York Evening Post, 1805",
