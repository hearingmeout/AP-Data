    "description": "“The study of African American oratorypublic speaking is intricatelycomplexly interwoven with the study of history; and a central aspect of African American history is the persistent public discussions related to our American experience. Having to defend our humanity, to agitate for minimal rights, and to soothe the raw emotions of mistreated fellows, our speakers have been forced to develop articulate and effective speech behavior on the platformstage or pulpit. That a principal dimension of black history is encompassed by platform activities in the form of lectures, sermons, and agitationsprotests should [be understood] without question [by] the student familiar with history. \nUnable to read or write English and forbidden by law (in most states) to learn, the African in America early cultivated the natural fascination with nommo, the word, and demonstrated a singular appreciation for the subtleties, pleasures, and potentials of the spoken word, which has continued to enrich and embolden [the African American’s] history. Thus, in part because of strict antiliteracy laws during slavery, vocal communication became, for a much greater proportion of blacks than whites, the fundamental medium of communication.” \n\nSource: Molefi Kete Asante, “African American Orature and Context” in The Afrocentric Idea, 1998",
