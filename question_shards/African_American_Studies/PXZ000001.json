    "description": "“For the enslaved men and women in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, the end of the Civil War offered little reason for jubilation.... Months after the war’s end and slavery’s demise in the United States, Choctaw and Chickasaw lawmakers...refused to contemplate the possibility of legally and socially redefining people of African descent as something other than slaves. Finally, in the spring of 1866, the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, despite having separate governments, entered a joint treaty with the United States...[in which] the issues of black people’s status and rights were tightly interwoven with matters of U.S. Indian policy—namely, the unrelenting drive to curb tribal sovereignty and claim the better part of Indian Territory for the United States....”\nSource: Barbara Krauthamer, historian, Black Slaves, Indian Masters : Slavery, Emancipation, and Citizenship in the Native American South, book published in 2013",
