One club has a day nursery and lunch room for school children.... Another club furnished properly chaperoned weekly entertainments for the young people.\n[The] Muskogee and El Reno clubs are promoting public libraries and hospitals. Many clubs all over the state are furnishing playgrounds for the children.”\nLibrary of Congress\nSource: Mrs. H. P. Jacobson, “Negro Women’s Club Work in Oklahoma,” The Tulsa Star, August 15, 1914",
