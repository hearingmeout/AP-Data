    "description": "A...planter...dined with us one day, and spoke with such freedom on slavery. With most men, he thinks the land can never be cultivated in the northern provinces by whites. The city slaves of Bahia, he said, are...shrewd and intelligent, they preserved their own language, and by that means organize clubs and mature schemes of revolution that their brethren of Pernambuco have repeatedly attempted to carry out. Some write Arabic fluently, and are vastly superior to most of their masters. In the interior, he remarked, the slaves are badly fed, worse clothed, and worked so hard that the average duration of their lives does not exceed six years. In some districts it reaches to eight, which the number that see ten years after leaving Africa is small indeed.\n\nSource: Thomas Ewbank, Life in Brazil; or, A journal of a visit to the land of the cocoa and the palm, 1856",
