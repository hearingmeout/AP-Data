    "description": "“In marked contrast with their enslaved or disenfranchised ancestors, these New Negroes demanded that their rights as citizens be vouchsafedgranted by law. Significantly, these New Negroes were to be recognized by their ‘education, refinement, and money,’ with property rights strongly implied as the hallmark of those who may demand their political rights. ‘Property,’ in this sense, is only one of a list of ‘properties’ demanded of this New Negro. ‘Education’ and ‘refinement’—to speak properly was to be proper—would ensure one’s rights, along with the security of property. These terms come to bear, curiously, upon subsequent definitions. J. W. E. Bowen, in ‘An Appeal to the King’ later that same year, again defined the New Negro, but here in terms only of racial ‘consciousness’ and its relation to ‘civilization’: ‘the consciousness of a racial personality under the blaze of a new civilization.’ Bowen’s ‘New Negro’ leads directly to the [Harlem or New Negro] Renaissance, for it was above all through literature that both ‘a racial personality’ and ‘the blaze of a new civilization’ would manifest themselves. Bowen’s ‘New Negro’ would create a universal racial art.”\nSource: Henry Louis Gates, Jr., “The New Negro and the Black Image: From Booker T. Washington to Alain Locke,” Harvard University National Humanities Center Fellow, 1988",
