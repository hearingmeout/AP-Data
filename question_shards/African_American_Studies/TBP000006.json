    "description": "Source 1\n“While some writers, such as Langston Hughes, traveled to Africa..., many others never made the trip. Their efforts to claim African identity, therefore, were rooted more in imagination and reading knowledge than in actual facts. Indeed, some white writers influenced African American conceptions of Africa. Vachel Lindsay is one such case. His poems in the vein of “The Congo” influenced Langston Hughes’s poetic imagination. Hughes’s poems about hearing African drums (“Danse Africaine,” for example) echo Lindsay’s work. African American writers were also not immune to notions of dark Africa that Joseph Conrad popularized in Heart of Darkness (1902). That conception is apparent in Countee Cullen’s “Heritage,” which is a classic poem about Africa from a Harlem Renaissance writer. In this long meditation..., Africa emerges as a...continent where wild animals roam and where the humans portrayed are only slightly more tame than the animals.... \nAfrica as the perceived dark continent and America as part of western civilization provides the generalized clash that shapes African American representations of Africa during the Harlem Renaissance. Africa becomes the space of license, the imaginative arena in which a speaker in a poem or a character in a text can shed the clothing of civilization and live a simpler, more natural, more uninhibited life.”\nSource: Trudier Harris, “The Image of Africa in the Literature of the Harlem Renaissance,” 2024 \n\nSource 2\nDanse Africaine\nThe low beating of the tom-toms, \nThe slow beating of the tom-toms,      \n        Low...slow \n        Slow...low — \n        Stirs your blood. \n                Dance!\nA night-veiled girl \n        Whirls softly into a\n        Circle of light. \n        Whirls softly...slowly, \nLike a wisp of smoke around the fire — \n        And the tom-toms beat, \n        And the tom-toms beat, \nAnd the low beating of the tom-toms \n        Stirs your blood.\nSource: Langston Hughes, “Danse Africaine,” 1922",
