    "description": "“From the beginning [of the voyage from West Africa to Cuba] there was manifest discontent among the slaves.... We had been at sea about three weeks...and there was so much merriment among the gangs [of enslaved people] that were allowed to come on deck, that my apprehensions of danger began gradually to wear away. Suddenly, however, one fair afternoon, a squallstorm broke forth from an almost cloudless sky; and as the boatswain’san officer on a ship whistle piped all hands to take in sail, a simultaneous rush was made by the confined slaves... and amid the confusion of the rising gale, they knocked down the guard and poured upon deck.... Meantime, the women in the cabin were not idle. Seconding the males, they rose in a body.... \nI saw that, between the squall...and the revolt...we would soon be in a desperate plight, unless I gave the order to shoot. Accordingly, I told my comrades to...fire at once. \n...The unharmed neither fled nor ceased brandishing their weapons.... But, being reinforced by the boatswain and carpenter, we took command of the hatches so effectually, that a dozen additional discharges... drove the refractoryrebels to their quarters below.”\nSource: Theodore Canot, recollections of the transatlantic slave trade from the 1820s to the 1840s",
