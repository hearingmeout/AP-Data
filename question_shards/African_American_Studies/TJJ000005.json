    "description": "Source 1\n“[Considering the incident, Merriweather said,]...America was founded for the sake of liberty and the establishment of an asylum for all who were oppressed. And no land has more actively engaged in the suppression of liberty, or in keeping down those who were already oppressed. So that a white boy raised on all sorts of high falutin idealism finds himself when he grows up completely at sea. I confess...when I came to realize that all my wealth and all the combination of environment and position which has made life hitherto so beautiful and perfect, were founded quite specifically on the backs of broken, beaten slaves, I got a shock from which I think sometimes I’ll never recover. It’s robbed me of happiness forever.... [T]hat sort of extremeness seems to be inherent in the question of color. Either you concern yourself with it violently as the Southerner does and so let slip by all the other important issues of life; or you are indifferent and callous like the average Northerner and grow hardened to all sorts of atrocities; or you steep yourself in it like the sentimentalist—that’s my class—and find yourself paralyzed by the vastness of the problem.”\nSource: Jessie Redmon Fauset, a novelist in the Harlem Renaissance, There is Confusion, 1924 \n\nSource 2Photograph of Flag Flown from the NAACP Headquarters, New York City\nLibrary of Congress",
