    "description": "“I look upon slavery as I do upon a deadly poison. The slaves are not contented nor happy in their lot.... The man I belonged to did not give us enough to eat. My feet were frostbitten on my way North, but I would rather have died on the way than to go back.\nI have had to go through a great deal of affliction; I have been compelled to work when I was sick. I used to have rheumatism, and could not always do so much work as those who were well, —then I would sometimes be whipped. I have never seen a runaway that wanted to go back, —I have never heard of one.\nThe fear of being sold South had more influence in inducing me to leave than any other thing. Master used to say, that if we didn’t suit him, he would put us in his pocket quick—meaning he would sell us....\nI have found good friends in Canada, but have been able to do no work on account of my frozen feet,—I lost two toes from my right foot. My determination is to go to work as soon as I am able....”\nSource: William Johnson, formerly enslaved person, 1856",
