    "description": "Lift Every Voice and Sing\n\nLet our rejoicing rise \nHigh as the listening skies, \nLet it resound loud as the rolling sea.\nSing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, \nSing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us. \nFacing the rising sun of our new day begun, \nLet us march on till victory is won....\n\nHave not our weary feet \nCome to the place for which our fathers sighed? \nWe have come over a way that with tears has been watered, \nWe have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,\nOut from the gloomy past, \nTill now we stand at last.\nSource: James Weldon Johnson, hymn set to music, originally written as a poem, 1900",
