    "description": "“...Both [Portugal and Kongo] possessed general-purpose monies—gold and silver in Portugal and monetary cloth and nzimbucowrie shells shells in Kongo... The two countries...[evolved] a rather complex system of currency exchanges and credits. The nature of this working arrangement can be gleaned from a ‘letter of credit’ which King Afonso I of Kongo drew up for his brother Manuel, travelling to Rome as his ambassador in 1540. Afonso asked for a grant of 5,000 cruzadosPortuguese money, and in exchange, created a credit of 150 kofuunit of measure for cowrie shells of nzimbu for the King of Portugal in Kongo. Other such money matters in the mid-sixteenth century were handled by the Kongolese trade representative in the city of Lisbon, who for some fifteen years was António Vereira, a noble Kongolese resident there.”\nSource: John Thornton, historian, “Early Kongo-Portuguese Relations: A New Interpretation,” History in Africa, 1981",
