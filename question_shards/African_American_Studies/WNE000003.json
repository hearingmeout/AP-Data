    "description": "“The blues insisted that the fate of the individual black man or woman, what happened in their “trivial” affairs, what took place within them—their yearnings, their problems, their frustrations, their dreams—were important, were worth taking note of and sharing in a song. Stressing individual expression and group coherence at one and the same time, the blues was an inward-looking music which insisted upon the meaningfulness of black lives. In these respects it was not only the more obviously angry work songs but the blues as well, that were subversive of the American racial order and proved to be an important portentsign of what was to come in a very few decades.”\nSource: Lawrence Levine, Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Thought from Slavery to Freedom, 1975",
