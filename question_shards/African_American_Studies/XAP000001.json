They were...loud, long and deep, breathing the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery.... To those songs I trace my first understanding of the dehumanizing character of slavery. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery and [strengthen] my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.”\nSource: Frederick Douglass, My Bondage and My Freedom, autobiography, 1855 \n\nSource 2\nDidn’t my Lord deliver Daniel,\ndeliver Daniel, deliver Daniel,\nDidn’t my Lord deliver Daniel,\nAn’ why not-a every man?\n\nHe delivered Daniel from the lion’s den,Daniel, Jonah, and the “Hebrew children” are from the Old Testament; they were saved from certain death by God because of the strength of their belief.\nJonah from the belly of the whale,Daniel, Jonah, and the “Hebrew children” are from the Old Testament; they were saved from certain death by God because of the strength of their belief.\nand the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace,Daniel, Jonah, and the “Hebrew children” are from the Old Testament; they were saved from certain death by God because of the strength of their belief.\nAnd why not every man?\nSource: Anonymous author, “Didn’t My Lord Deliver Daniel,” spiritual, nineteenth century",
