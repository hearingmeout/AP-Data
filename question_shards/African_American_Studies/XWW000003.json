    "description": "Source 1 \n“On the 9th day of September...[twenty] Angola negroes assembled...and one who was called Jemmy was their captain. They surprised a warehouse belonging to Mr. Hutchenson...they there killed Mr. Robert Bathurst, and Mr. Gibbs, plundered the house, and took a pretty many small arms and powder.... They then...marched southward...through Georgia to Augustine.... They increased every minute by new negroes coming to them, so that they were above sixty, some say a hundred, [when] they halted in a field, and set to dancing, singing and beating drums, to draw more negroes to them...but...the planters...pursued them and when they came up...charged them on foot.... About 30 escaped from the flight.... General Oglethorpe...immediately ordered a troop of rangers...to patrol through Georgia...and published a proclamation ordering all the constables...of Georgia to pursue and seize all negroes.... It is hoped these measures will prevent any negroes from getting down to the Spaniards.”\nSource: Unknown author, a description of the Stono Rebellion, South Carolina, 1739, in the Colonial Records of the State of Georgia \n\nSource 2 \n“Mose was located...directly north of St. Augustine.... It was strategically significant. Governor Montiano surely considered the benefits of a northern outpost against anticipated British attacks. And who better to serve as an advanced warning system than grateful ex-slaves carrying Spanish arms? The freedmen understood their expected role, for, in a declaration to the king, they vowed to be ‘the most cruel enemies of the English’ and to risk their lives and spill their ‘last drop of blood in defense of the Great Crown of Spain and the Holy Faith.’ If the new homesteaders were diplomats, they were also pragmatistsperson who is practical and focused on a goal, and their own interests were clearly served by fighting those who would seek to return them to chattel slavery.”\nSource: Jane Landers, historian, “Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose: A Free Black Town in a Spanish Colony,” article published in the American Historical Review, 1990",
