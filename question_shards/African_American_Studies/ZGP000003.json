    "description": "In Praise of the Ironsmith\nToday this place is full of noise and jollitycelebration.\nThe guiding spirit that enables my husband to forgeto shape metal by heating makes him do wonders.\nAll those who lack hoes for weeding, come and buy!\nHoes and choppers are here in plenty.\nMy husband is a craftsman in iron,\nTruly a wizard at forging hoes.\nAh, here they are! They have come eager to find hoes.\nAh, the iron itself is aglow, it is molten red with heat,\nAnd the ore is ruddy and incandescent.\nMy husband is an expert in working iron,\nA craftsman who sticks like wax to his trade.\nOn the day when the urge to forge comes upon him,\nThe bellowsa fan used to increase the heat of a fire do everything but speak.\nThe pile of slagwaste created when working with iron rises higher and higher.\nJust look at what has been forged,\nAt the choppers, at the hoes, at the battle axes,\nAnd here at the pile of hatchets, large and small.\nThen look at the double-bladed knives and the adzes.\nMerely to list them all seems like boasting.\nAs for fowlsbirds raised for meat or eggs and goats, they cover my yard.\nThey all come from the sale of tools and weapons.\nHere is where you see me eating at ease with a spoon.\nSource: Unknown author, Shona Praise Poetry",
