    "description": "“The conduct of the late election [of 1876] in Mississippi...put in question and jeopardy the sacred rights of the citizens; and the [congressional] investigation contemplated...has for its objective...the protection in all their purity and significance of the political rights of the people and the free institutions of the country.... \nThe evidence in hand and accessible will show...that in many parts of the State corrupt and violent influences were brought to bear upon the registrars of voters, thus materially affecting the character of the voting or poll lists.... Threats and violence were practiced directly upon the masses of voters in such measures and strength as to produce grave apprehensions for their personal safety, and as to deter them from the exercise of their political franchises.... \nThe sober American judgment must [prevail] in the South as elsewhere in the Republic, ...that differences of religion, nationality, or race can neither with safety nor propriety be permitted for a moment to enter into the [political] party contests of the day.”\nSource: Speech by Blanche K. Bruce, United States senator from Mississippi, the first African American to serve a full term in the Senate, 1876",
