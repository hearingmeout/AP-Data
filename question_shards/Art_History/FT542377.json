    "question": "The work shown is a video still of The Crossing by Bill Viola. In this work, Viola uses water conceptually to transmit meaning.\n\nSelect and completely identify another work of art that uses water conceptually to transmit meaning.\n\nWhat meaning is transmitted in each work? Using visual or contextual evidence, analyze at least two similarities between the two works in terms of how water is used conceptually to transmit meaning.\n\nThen, using visual or contextual evidence, analyze at least two differences between the two works in terms of how water is used conceptually to transmit meaning.\n\nTo answer this question, you may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work of art. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nAlhambra\n\nFallingwater\n\nSpiral Jetty\n\nUnder the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), also known as the Great Wave, from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji",
