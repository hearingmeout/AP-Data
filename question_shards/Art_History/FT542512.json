Select and completely identify an artwork from Africa, the Indigenous Americas, or the Pacific that was created and performed to offer humans access to supernatural, political, and/or social power. Identify the materials and/or symbolism in the artwork that offer humans access to power. Describe both the type of power those materials and/or symbolism are intended to activate and the performance that activates that power. Explain how cultural beliefs support the practices associated with the artwork that offer humans access to power. What response or effect was the performance of this work intended to elicit?
