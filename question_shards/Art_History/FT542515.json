    "question": "The images show two views of the same architectural complex.\n\nIdentify the culture in which the architectural complex shown was constructed.\n\nCompletely identify the architectural complex in the Image Set that was constructed within the same culture.\n\nJustify your attribution by comparing the two complexes, using specific visual evidence.\n\nUsing both specific visual and contextual evidence, analyze how both complexes communicate a sense of power.\n\nWhen identifying the work, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate.",
