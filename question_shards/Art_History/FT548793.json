    "question": "Many artists use the metaphoric, conceptual, and/or formal properties of light to convey spiritual meaning in works of art and architecture. Select and completely identify a work of art or architecture in which light was used to convey spiritual meaning. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from Early Europe and Colonial Americas (200–1750 C.E.). Describe at least two elements of form and/or content (such as materials, iconography, composition) that use light to convey spiritual meaning. Explain how the artist or designer used these elements of form and/or content to convey spiritual meaning. Then, use at least two examples of specific contextual evidence (such as site, intended audience, historical and cultural milieu) to explain why light was used to convey spiritual meaning. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given. Calling of Saint Matthew Chartres Cathedral Ecstasy of Saint Teresa",
