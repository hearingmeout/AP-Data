    "question": "The images show two views of the same architectural structure. The work shown is not included in the required course content. Attribute the architectural structure shown to a specific culture by identifying the work from the same specific culture in the required course content that is most similar in form and function. Then, using specific visual and contextual evidence, justify your attribution by comparing the architectural structure shown to the corresponding work in the required course content. Explain how both the construction materials and the building techniques accommodated the form and function of these structures. When identifying the work, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. To earn credit for the identification, you must provide culture of origin and one additional accurate identifier of your own selection. You will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate.",
