For a question involving two slides, when you are not asked specifically to name the artists and/or titles of the works, you may refer to the work on the left as (L) and the work on the right as (R). A response that answers the question directly will receive a higher score than one that simply lists characteristics or includes irrelevant points. Both of the residences shown were built for wealthy merchants in the mid-fifteenth century. The building on the left is French, and the building on the right is Italian. Discuss and account for the differences between these buildings.",
