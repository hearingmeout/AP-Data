    "question": "This question is based on one or two slides. For a question involving two slides, when you are not asked specifically to name the artists and/or titles of the works, you may refer to the work on the left as (L) and the work on the right as (R). A response that answers the question directly will receive a higher score than one that simply lists characteristics or includes irrelevant points. Take a moment to read the question carefully before formulating your answer. The following statement, made by Mary Cassatt in 1904, refers to her 1879 collaboration with the artistic group with which she is most closely associated. “Our . . . exhibition . . . was a protest against official exhibitions and not a grouping of artists with the same tendencies . . . . ” To which group of artists does Cassatt’s remark pertain? Referring to the Cassatt work shown and a work by one other artist in this group, defend her claim that these artists did not have the same stylistic tendencies.",
