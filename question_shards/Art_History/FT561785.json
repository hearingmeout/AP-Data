    "question": "As Buddhism expanded across Asia, Buddhist art and architecture were expressed in a variety of ways in relation to the visual traditions of the region. Select and completely identify one Buddhist architectural complex associated with the expansion of Buddhism across Asia. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from West and Central Asia (500 B.C.E.–1980 C.E.) or South, East, and Southeast Asia (300 B.C.E.–1980 C.E.). Describe the Buddhist complex using at least two examples of specific visual evidence (such as architectural features or imagery). Explain how two features of the complex are typical of the visual traditions of the region. Using specific contextual evidence, explain how two features of the complex functioned to facilitate Buddhist practices. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given. Great Stupa at Sanchi Longmen caves Todai-ji",
