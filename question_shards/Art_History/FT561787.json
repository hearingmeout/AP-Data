Justify your attribution by describing two formal similarities between the two works. Infer the probable content of the work shown based on the content of the corresponding work in the required course content. Explain how works such as these were intended to be experienced in their original context. When identifying the work from the required course content, you must include the culture of origin and one additional accurate identifier of your own selection: title or designation, date of creation, or materials. You will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide beyond the two required are inaccurate.",
