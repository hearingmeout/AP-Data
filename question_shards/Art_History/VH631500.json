    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nSuggested time: 30 minutes.\n\nThe work shown is a battle scene from the Great Altar of Zeus and Athena at Pergamon, created c. 175 B.C.E.\n\nSelect and completely identify another work that also depicts a battle or conflict. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from Ancient Mediterranean (3500 B.C.E. to 300 C.E.).\n\nFor both the Great Altar of Zeus and Athena at Pergamon and your selected work, describe the subject matter of the battle or conflict that is depicted.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least two similarities and/or differences in how the imagery depicts the battle or conflict.\n\nExplain one similarity in how the imagery of battles or conflicts in both works reinforces concepts of power or leadership. Use specific contextual evidence from both the Great Altar of Zeus and Athena at Pergamon and your selected work in your explanation.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nColumn of Trajan Palette of King Narmer",
