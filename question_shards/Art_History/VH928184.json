An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The work shown is Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, created by Gian Lorenzo Bernini c. 1647–1652 C.E. The work depicts a specific religious narrative in a way that is designed to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Select and completely identify another work that references or depicts a specific religious narrative in a way that is designed to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from Early Europe and Colonial Americas (200–1750 C.E.). Describe the content of the religious narrative that is referenced or depicted in both Ecstasy of Saint Teresa and your selected work. Using specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and at least one difference in how the two works represent the religious narrative. Explain at least one difference in how both works elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Use specific visual or contextual evidence about both the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa and your selected work in the explanation. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.
