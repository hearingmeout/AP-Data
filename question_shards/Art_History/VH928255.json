An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The images show an exterior and an interior view of the Mosque of Selim II, built in Edirne, Turkey, by Sinan between 1568–1575 C.E. The structure demonstrates characteristics of mosque architecture specific to its location. Describe at least two visual characteristics of the Mosque of Selim II. Using specific evidence, explain how visual characteristics of the Mosque of Selim II demonstrate continuity with global conventions of mosque architecture. Using specific evidence, explain both how and why visual characteristics of the Mosque of Selim II demonstrate changes from global conventions of mosque architecture.",
