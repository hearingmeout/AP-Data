An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The images show the exterior and interior of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) in London, England, built 1840–1870 C.E. and designed by Charles Barry and Augustus W. N. Pugin. Describe at least two visual characteristics of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament). Using at least two examples of specific visual evidence, explain how the visual characteristics of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) reference earlier architectural traditions.
