An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The work shown is The Saint-Lazare Station, painted by Claude Monet in 1877 C.E. In the work, Monet conveys his attitude toward technological and scientific change in nineteenth-century Paris. Select and completely identify another painting, drawing, or print from Later Europe and Americas (1750–1980 C.E.) that conveys the artist’s attitude toward technological and/or scientific change. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant painting, drawing, or print from Later Europe and Americas (1750–1980 C.E.). Describe the content of both The Saint-Lazare Station and your selected work. Using specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and at least one difference in how the works depict technological and/or scientific change. Explain at least one similarity or difference in how the works convey the artists’ attitudes toward technological and/or scientific change within their respective cultures. Use specific contextual evidence about both The Saint-Lazare Station and your selected work in your explanation. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate.
