    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe work shown is Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye, constructed in 1929 C.E. In this work, Le Corbusier used the design of the building both to accommodate daily life and to express an aesthetic philosophy.\n\nSelect and completely identify another domestic structure from Later Europe and Americas (1750-1980 C.E.) in which the architect used the design of the building both to accommodate daily life and to express an aesthetic philosophy. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from Later Europe and Americas (1750-1980 C.E.).\n\nDescribe the design of both Villa Savoye and your selected work.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and at least one difference in how the two works were designed to accommodate daily life.\n\nExplain at least one difference in the aesthetic philosophies that the architects expressed in the design of these structures. Use specific contextual evidence about both Villa Savoye and your selected work in your explanation.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the architect and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nFallingwaterHouse in New Castle CountyMonticello",
