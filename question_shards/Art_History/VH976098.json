An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe structure shown, in an aerial view and a detail, is the Borobudur Temple in Central Java, Indonesia. Like many architectural structures, it was built to facilitate religious observance within its culture.\n\nSelect and completely identify another structure or complex from South, East, and Southeast Asia (300 B.C.E.–1980 C.E.) that was built to facilitate religious observance. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from South, East, and Southeast Asia (300 B.C.E.–1980 C.E.).\n\nDescribe the design of both the Borobudur Temple and the architectural structure or complex that you have selected.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain two similarities and/or differences in how the two works are intended to facilitate religious practice.\n\nExplain one similarity or difference in how both structures express religious meaning within their respective cultures. Use specific contextual evidence about both the Borobudur Temple and your selected work in your explanation.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nGreat Stupa at SanchiLakshmana TempleThe temple of Angkor Wat",
