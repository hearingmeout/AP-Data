An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The two images show an overview and a close-up of the city of Machu Picchu, built in the central highlands of Peru c. 1450–1540 C.E. Describe both the visual characteristics and the physical context of the city. Using at least two examples of specific contextual evidence, explain how the design of the city of Machu Picchu relates to its physical and cultural context.
