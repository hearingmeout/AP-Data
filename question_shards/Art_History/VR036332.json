    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe work shown is a statue of Augustus of Prima Porta, created during the early first century C.E. The statue's iconography (its imagery and symbols) communicates ideals of political power and authority in imperial Rome.\n\nSelect and completely identify another work depicting a ruler in which iconography communicates ideals of political power and authority. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work.\n\nDescribe the iconography of both the statue of Augustus of Prima Porta and your selected work.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least two similarities in how the two works communicate ideals of political power and authority.\n\nExplain at least one difference in how the two works communicate ideals of political power and authority within their respective cultures. Use specific visual or contextual evidence about both the statue of Augustus of Prima Porta and your selected work in your explanation.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nGeorge WashingtonJahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to KingsNdop (portrait figure) of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul",
