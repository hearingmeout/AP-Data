An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The work shown is the Great Mosque of Djenné, which was founded in Mali c. 1200 C.E. The structure demonstrates characteristics of mosque architecture specific to its location. Describe at least two materials or techniques used in the construction of the Great Mosque of Djenné. Using specific evidence, explain how the architectural features of the Great Mosque of Djenné demonstrate continuity with global conventions of mosque architecture. Using specific evidence, explain both how and why the architectural features of the Great Mosque of Djenné demonstrate changes from global conventions of mosque architecture.",
