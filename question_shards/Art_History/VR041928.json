    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe work shown is the Last Judgment tympanum of the Church of Sainte-Foy in Conques, France, created circa 1050–1130 C.E. The work conveys medieval European cultural ideas about death and the afterlife.\n\nSelect and identify another work that conveys cultural ideas about death and the afterlife. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work that conveys ideas about death and the afterlife.\n\nDescribe the iconography of both the Last Judgment tympanum of the Church of Sainte-Foy and your selected work.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and at least one difference in how the two works depict death and the afterlife.\n\nExplain at least one difference in how both works convey ideas related to death and the afterlife within their respective cultures. Use specific contextual evidence about both the Last Judgment tympanum of the Church of Sainte-Foy and your selected work in your explanation.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nFuneral banner of Lady DaiLast judgment of Hu-Nefer",
