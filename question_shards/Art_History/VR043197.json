An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nMany artists from Global Contemporary (1980 C.E. to Present) use their work to communicate specific ideas by appropriating imagery from specific works or referencing art historical traditions from the Western canon.\n\nSelect and completely identify one work in which the artist appropriates imagery from a specific work or references an art historical tradition from the Western canon to communicate a specific idea. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from Global Contemporary (1980 C.E. to Present).\n\nExplain why the artist appropriates imagery from a specific work or references an art historical tradition from the Western canon in the work.\n\nIn your response, you should do the following.\n\nProvide two accurate identifiers for the work of art you have selected.\n\nRespond to the prompt with an art historically defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning.\n\nSupport your claim with at least two examples of relevant visual and/or contextual evidence.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports the claim.\n\nCorroborate or qualify your claim by explaining relevant connections, providing nuance, or considering diverse views.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nUntitled (#228), from the History Portraits seriesDancing at the Louvre, from the series The French Collection, Part I; #1The Swing (after Fragonard)",
