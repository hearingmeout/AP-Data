    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) In Early Europe and Colonial Americas, many artists communicate specific ideas through the depiction of the human form in their works. Select and completely identify one work from the list below or any other relevant work from Early Europe and Colonial Americas (200–1750 C.E.) that focuses on the depiction of the human form. Explain how the artist communicates specific ideas through the depiction of the human form in their work. In your response you should do the following: Provide two accurate identifiers for the work of art you have selected. Respond to the prompt with an art historically defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. Support your claim with at least two examples of relevant visual and/or contextual evidence. Explain how the evidence supports the claim. Corroborate or qualify your claim by explaining relevant connections, providing nuance, or considering diverse views. When identifying the work you have selected, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given. Adam and EveRöttgen Pietá",
