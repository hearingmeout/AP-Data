An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C.

(anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe images show a plan and an overview of the Forbidden City, which served as the center of political power in China starting in the fifteenth century C.E.\n\nSelect and completely identify another work of architecture that served as a center of political power. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work of architecture.\n\nDescribe visual characteristics of the plan or layout of both the Forbidden City and your selected work.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least two similarities in how features of both works of architecture communicated ideals of political power.\n\nExplain one difference in how both works of architecture communicated ideals of political power within their respective cultures. Use specific contextual evidence from both the Forbidden City and your selected work in your explanation.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the architect and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate.
