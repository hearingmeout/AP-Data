    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe images show a transformation mask from the late nineteenth century C.E., which facilitates a connection between humans and the spiritual world in the Kwakwaka’wakw culture.\n\nSelect and completely identify another work of art that facilitates a connection between humans and the spiritual world. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from any geographic area or time period.\n\nDescribe specific visual characteristics of both the transformation mask and your selected work.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and one difference in how the transformation mask and your selected work facilitate a connection between humans and the spiritual world.\n\nExplain one similarity or one difference in how the transformation mask and your selected work express the values or beliefs of the society in which each work was created. Support your explanation with an example of relevant iconographic (use of symbols) or contextual information from both the transformation mask and your selected work.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given.\n\nPower figure (Nkisi n’kondi)Reliquary of Sainte-Foy",
