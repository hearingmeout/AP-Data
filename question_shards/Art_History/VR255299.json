(anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.)\n\nThe image shows a sculpture of maize cobs from c. 1440–1533 C.E., which conveyed the significance of the natural world to the Inka society in which it was created.\n\nSelect and completely identify another work of art that conveys the significance of the natural world. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from any geographic area or time period.\n\nDescribe specific visual characteristics of both the maize cobs and your selected work.\n\nUsing specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and one difference in how the maize cobs and your selected work convey the significance of the natural world.\n\nExplain one similarity or one difference in how the maize cobs and your selected work express the values or beliefs of the society in which each work was created. Support your explanation with an example of relevant iconographic (use of symbols) or contextual information from both the maize cobs and your selected work.\n\nWhen identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials.
