    "question": "Read the question carefully. You can receive full credit only by directly answering all aspects of the question. You must answer the question in essay form. An outline or bulleted list is not acceptable. (Note: This exam uses the chronological designations B.C.E. (before the common era) and C.E. (common era). These designations correspond to B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (anno Domini), which are used in some art history resources.) The image shows a sculpture of maize cobs from c. 1440–1533 C.E., which depicts an ordinary object in a way that elevates it to a higher level of meaning for the Inka society in which it was created. Select and completely identify another work of art that elevates an ordinary object to a higher level of meaning. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work from any geographic area or time period. Describe specific visual characteristics of both the maize cobs and your selected work. Using specific visual evidence from both works, explain at least one similarity and one difference in how the maize cobs and your selected work elevate an ordinary object or objects to a higher level of meaning. Explain one similarity or one difference in how the maize cobs and your selected work express the values or beliefs of the society in which each work was created. Support your explanation with an example of relevant iconographic (use of symbols) or contextual information from both the maize cobs and your selected work. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the artist and/or culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given. Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure),Pyxis of al-Mughira",
