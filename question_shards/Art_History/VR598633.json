    "question": "The work shown is the Great Stupa at Sanchi, a work of Buddhist architecture created between 300 B.C.E.–100 C.E. in India during the Sunga dynasty. The structure’s architectural and sculptural program supports its function as a religious site. Select and completely identify another work of architecture that was designed to serve a religious function. You may select a work from the list below or any other relevant work of architecture. Describe the visual characteristics of the Great Stupa at Sanchi and your selected work. Using specific visual evidence from both works of architecture, explain one similarity and/or difference in how the designs of both works guide people’s use of the space for religious practices. Explain one difference in how both works of architecture communicate religious ideas associated with each site. Use specific visual or contextual evidence from both the Great Stupa at Sanchi and your selected work in your explanation. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, name of the architect and/or culture of origin, date of creation, religion, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given. Chartres CathedralGreat Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh)Ryoan-ji",
