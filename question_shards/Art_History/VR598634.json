    "question": "Note: There are no images provided for Question 2. In later European and American art, many artists created self-portraits as a means of conveying their social, political, artistic, and/or personal identities. Select and completely identify one self-portrait from the list below or any other relevant work from Later Europe and Americas (1750–1980 C.E.). Explain how the artist conveys their identity in the self-portrait. In your response you should do the following: Provide two accurate identifiers for the work of art you have selected. Respond to the prompt with an art historically defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. Support your claim with at least two examples of relevant visual and/or contextual evidence. Explain how the evidence supports the claim. Corroborate or qualify your claim by explaining relevant connections, providing nuance, or considering diverse views. When identifying the work you select, you should try to include all of the following identifiers: title or designation, culture of origin, date of creation, and materials. You will earn credit for the identification if you provide at least two accurate identifiers, but you will not be penalized if any additional identifiers you provide are inaccurate. If you select a work from the list below, you must include at least two accurate identifiers beyond those that are given. Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le BrunErnst Ludwig KirchnerFrida Kahlo",
