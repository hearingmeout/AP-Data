    "description": "The antibiotic blasticidin S is a large molecule that can inhibit protein synthesis in mammalian cells. A researcher is investigating how blasticidin S enters mammalian cells. The researcher identified two proteins that might be associated with blasticidin S transport into the cell.",
    "question": "Which of the following claims most likely explains how the two proteins are directly involved in the antibiotic’s ability to enter the cell?",
