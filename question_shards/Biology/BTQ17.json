    "description": "A researcher conducted an experiment in a brightly lit aquarium containing a large population of single-celled green algae. Water containing radioactive phosphorus was added to the aquarium. After 7 days, the researcher took a water sample containing the algae and separated the algae from the radioactive water (RW*).",
    "question": "The researcher added deionized water to rinse the algae and saved the rinse water and then repeated that process twice. The rinse water from each of the three rinses was saved as RW1, RW2, and RW3, respectively. The researcher also removed and kept the nuclei of the algal cells. The nuclei were mixed with deionized water, and a drop of the mixture was placed on a piece of filter paper. A drop of the radioactive water and a drop of each of the rinse water samples were also placed on the same paper. These samples were exposed to X-ray to determine their radioactivity. The results after 24 hours are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Radioactivity of saved algal water samples. Darker color and larger circle size indicate a higher level of radioactivity. Based on Figure 1, which of the following statements best explains why the nuclei sample had a higher level of radioactivity than any of the rinse water samples?",
