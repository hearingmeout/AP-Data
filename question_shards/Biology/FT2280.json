    "description": "Living cells typically have biosynthetic pathways to synthesize at least some of the amino acids used in making proteins. Some strains of E. coli, a prokaryote, can synthesize the amino acid tryptophan, while other E. coli strains cannot. Similarly, some strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae, a eukaryote, can synthesize tryptophan, while other S. cerevisiae strains cannot.",
    "question": "Which of the following describes the most likely source of genetic variation found in the tryptophan synthesis pathways of both species?",
