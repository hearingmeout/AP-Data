    "question": "In the year 2000, specimens of Caulerpa taxifolia,a green alga used in tropical aquariums, were found off the coast of California. Native to the Indian Ocean, C. taxifolia is known for aggressive growth and an ability to compete with sea grasses.It is currently on an international list of invasive species. Which of the following best predicts the consequences of the introduction of C. taxifolia to the California coast?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Without natural herbivores or competitors,C. taxifolia will grow rapidly and crowd out native species of producers.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "C. taxifolia will have a hard time establishing itself because it will have to compete against native species of sea grasses, which are better adapted to the environment.",

      {
        "label": "C. taxifolia will grow rapidly, leading to an increase in the diversity of producers.",

      {
        "label": "Because it is not in the Indian Ocean, its natural environment, C. taxifolia will not be able to grow efficiently.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "Without natural herbivores or competitors,C. taxifolia will grow rapidly and crowd out native species of producers."
