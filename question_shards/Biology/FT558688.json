    "question": "In a separate investigation, individual mice from two populations that in nature are geographically isolated from each other are mated in the laboratory. The hybrid offspring were then mated with individuals from either of the original populations. Only the female hybrid offspring were fertile. The experimental results are most consistent with which of the stages that are depicted in the model?",
