    "question": "Researchers inserted a small fragment of human DNA into the pTET-KAN plasmid. Cultures of E. coli were transformed with the modified plasmid. The transformed bacterial cells were able to survive in the presence of tetracycline but were unable to survive in the presence of kanamycin. Draw an \"X\" on the plasmid template provided below to indicate where the human DNA fragment was most likely inserted. Justify your placement of the inserted human DNA.",
