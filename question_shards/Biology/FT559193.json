    "description": "Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. In an experiment, bacteriophages were labeled with either radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur. The labeled bacteriophages were incubated with bacteria for a brief amount of time and then removed. The infected bacteria cells were found to contain significant amounts of radioactive phosphorus but not radioactive sulfur.",
    "question": "Based on the results of the experiment, which of the following types of molecules did the bacteriophages most likely inject into the bacteria cells?",
