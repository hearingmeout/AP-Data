    "question": "In contrast to type 1 diabetes, where there is no insulin production, type 2 diabetes is characterized by a failure of body cells to respond normally to insulin. Based on the results of the experiment, which of the following best predicts the effectiveness of using hESC-β implantation to treat type 2 diabetes?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The treatment would fail because insulin produced by implanted hESC-β cells will not stimulate glucose uptake by body cells.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The treatment would fail because the implanted hESC-β cells would require more glucose than the body can produce.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The treatment would succeed because the implanted hESC-β cells can express the gene that codes for human insulin.",
