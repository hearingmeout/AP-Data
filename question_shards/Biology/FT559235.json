    "question": "Toxic substances often have a bitter taste that causes animals who try to eat such substances to spit them out rather than swallow them. Additional data suggest that gorilla populations have a very low frequency of nontasters. Which of the following best predicts the likely evolution of the TAS2R38 locus in the gorilla population?",
