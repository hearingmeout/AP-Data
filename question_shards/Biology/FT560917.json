    "question": "The gene sequences responsible for the iron ­mediated changes in ferritin protein levels are highly conserved and are called iron response elements (IREs). IREs have been observed in a number of genes involved in iron transport and metabolism. The IRE sequences found in the ferritin gene are found in all multicellular organisms, whereas other nonferritin IRE sequences are found only in certain vertebrate organisms. Which of the following is the best explanation for the observations?",
