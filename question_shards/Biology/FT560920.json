    "question": "The figure above shows a series of microscope images taken over time of ovalbumin production in chick oviduct cells in response to stimulation with estrogen. The ovalbumin protein was detected using a fluorescent dye as shown by the white areas in the time-lapse sequence. The microscope images indicate that ovalbumin",
