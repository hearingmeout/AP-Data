        "label": "The figure presents a graph of two curves, one solid and one dashed, in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “Armor Plating,” and there is an arrowhead at the end of the axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Number of Males in Population,” and there is an arrowhead at the end of the axis. The behavior of the curves is as follows.  The solid curve begins at the origin, then slopes upward and to the right until it reaches a peak two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis, and high above the horizontal axis. The curve then slopes downward and to the right until it ends on the horizontal axis. The dashed curve consists of two peaks. The curve begins at the origin, then slopes upward and to the right to a peak one fourth of the way along the horizontal axis, high above the horizontal axis, and of the same height as the peak of the solid curve. The curve then slopes downward and to the right into a valley halfway along the horizontal axis and of half the height as the peak of the curve. The curve then slopes upward to a second peak three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis, and of the same height as the first peak. The curve then slopes downward to end at the same point as the solid curve ends. A single downward pointing arrow points to a position immediately to the right of the first intersection of the solid and dashed curves.",

The height of the line is at half of the height of the peak of the solid curve. Three downward pointing arrows point to the following positions on the graph. The first arrow points to a position about one eighth of the way along the horizontal axis, well before the first intersection of the two curves. The second arrow points to a position immediately to the right of the first intersection of the two curves. The third arrow points to the second point of intersection of the two curves.",

The curve then slopes downward to intersect the first curve, and ends at the same point as the solid curve ends. Two downward pointing arrows point to the following positions on the graph. The first arrow points to a position about one eighth of the way along the horizontal axis and halfway to the peak of the dashed curve. The second arrow points to an equivalent position to the right of the peak of the dashed curve and about seven eighths of the way along the horizontal axis.",
