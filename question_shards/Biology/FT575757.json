    "description": "In an experiment, a scientist isolates mitochondria from living cells and suspends them in two different buffered solutions. One solution is maintained at pH 4, while the other solution is maintained at pH 9. The scientist finds that mitochondria in the solution at pH 4 continue to produce ATP but those in the pH 9 solution do not.",
    "question": "The results of the experiment can be used as evidence in support of which of the following scientific claims about mitochondrial activity?",
