It is important that you read each question completely before you begin. Matter continuously cycles through an ecosystem. A simplified carbon cycle is depicted below. (a) Identify the key metabolic process for step I and the key metabolic process for step II, and briefly explain how each process promotes movement of carbon through the cycle. For each process, your explanation should focus on the role of energy in the movement of carbon.",
