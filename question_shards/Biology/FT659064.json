It is important that you read each question completely before you begin. A research team has genetically engineered a strain of fruit flies to eliminate errors during DNA replication. The team claims that this will eliminate genetic variation in the engineered flies. A second research team claims that eliminating errors during DNA replication will not entirely eliminate genetic variation in the engineered flies. (a) Provide ONE piece of evidence that would indicate new genetic variation has occurred in the engineered flies.",
