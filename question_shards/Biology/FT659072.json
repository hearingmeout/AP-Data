Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable. Both mitosis and meiosis are forms of cell division that produce daughter cells containing genetic information from the parent cell. (a) Describe TWO events that are common to both mitosis and meiosis that ensure the resulting daughter cells inherit the appropriate number of chromosomes.",
