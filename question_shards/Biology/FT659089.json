    "question": "The yellow-fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is a major vector of human disease. In a particular location in Africa, there are two forms of the mosquito. The forest form of the mosquito is black and often lays its eggs in tree holes and pools of water in the forest. The domestic form of the mosquito is brown and prefers to lay its eggs in rainwater collected near human dwellings. Researchers used a choice chamber (Figure 1) to investigate the host preference of A. aegypti. The researchers recorded the number of forest-form and domestic-form mosquitoes that bit human or guinea pig hosts during several ten-minute trials. The researchers used these data to calculate a host-preference index for each form, as shown in Figure 2. Researchers also identified a gene in the mosquitoes, OR4, that encodes an olfactory receptor. A volatile odorant, sulcatone, binds to the OR4 receptor. Humans produce higher levels of sulcatone than do guinea pigs. (a) Based on an analysis of the data, identify the preferred host of the forest form and of the domestic form of the mosquito.",
