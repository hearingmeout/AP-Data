    "question": "The secondary compound cyanide (Figure 1) is a toxic, bitter-tasting chemical that is found in apple seeds. Cyanide in seeds is only released and tasted if the seed is crushed. When animals eat apples, they typically eat the sweet fleshy part of the fruit and spit out the seeds or swallow them whole. (a) Based on the chemical structure of cyanide, identify ONE type of biological macromolecule that could serve as a chemical precursor for the production of cyanide in a plant. Justify your choice.",
