One type of <math alttext=\"I V\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>IV</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> fluid is essentially a saltwater solution. To determine the best concentration for therapy in people, a team of students is researching the effects of solutions of different salt concentrations on red blood cells. The following observations were made from three different red blood cell samples viewed under a microscope.",
