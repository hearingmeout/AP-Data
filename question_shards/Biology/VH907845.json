    "question": "A student is using dialysis bags to model the effects of changing solute concentrations on cells. The student places one dialysis bag that contains <math alttext=\"25 milliliters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>25</mtext><mtext> mL</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> of distilled water into each of two beakers that are filled with <math alttext=\"200 milliliters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mtext>200</mtext><mtext> mL</mtext></mstyle></math> of distilled water. (Figure 1). The membrane of each dialysis bag membrane contains pores that allow small solutes such as monoatomic ions to pass through but are too small for anything larger to pass. After 30 minutes, <math alttext=\"5 milliliters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>5</mtext><mtext> mL</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> of a concentrated solution of albumin (a medium-sized, water-soluble protein) is added to one of the two beakers. Nothing is added to the other beaker. After two more hours at room temperature, the mass of each bag is determined. There is no change in the mass of the dialysis bag in the beaker to which no albumin was added. Which of the graphs below best represents the predicted change in mass over time of the dialysis bag in the beaker to which albumin was added?",
