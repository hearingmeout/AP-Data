    "description": "Brown fat is a type of fat tissue found in hibernating mammals. Inside the mitochondria of these fat tissue cells, these mammals have an uncoupling protein embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This uncoupling protein allows hydrogen ions to leak from the intermembrane space back into the mitochondrial matrix. Figure 1 shows details of the processes in the inner mitochondrial membrane.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Processes in the inner mitochondrial membrane Which of the following statements provides reasoning that supports the claim that brown fatty tissue keeps an animal warm?",
