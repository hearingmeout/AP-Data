Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the energy-processing organelles of eukaryotic cells. Both organelles contain outer and inner membranes. The inner membrane of the mitochondrion contains many folds. The chloroplasts have a third membrane forming the thylakoids. Molecules such as enzymes responsible for the synthesis of ATP are embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. (a) Describe the importance of the inner membranes separating different regions of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast.",
