    "description": "A researcher designs an experiment to investigate whether soil bacteria trigger the synthesis of defense enzymes in plant roots. The design of the experiment is presented in Table 1. For each group in the experiment, the researcher will determine the average rate of change in the amount of defense enzymes in the roots of the seedlings.",
    "question": "Table 1. An experiment to investigate the effect of soil bacteria on plant defenses Group Number of Seedlings Type of Soil Treatment Solution 1 10 Sterile potting soil Contains actively reproducing soil bacteria 2 10 Sterile potting soil Contains heat-killed soil bacteria 3 10 Sterile potting soil Contains no soil bacteria Which of the following statements best helps justify the inclusion of group 2 as one of the controls in the experiment?",
