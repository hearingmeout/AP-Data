    "description": "A small protein is composed of 110 amino acids linked together in a chain. As shown in Figure 1, the first and last five amino acids in the chain are hydrophobic (have nonpolar and uncharged <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>R</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>-groups), whereas the remaining 100 amino acids are hydrophilic (have charged or polar <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>R</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>-groups). The nature of the <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>R</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>-group determines if the amino acid is hydrophobic or hydrophilic.",
    "question": "A mutation results in the production of a version of the small protein that is only 105 amino acids long, as shown in Figure 2. Five of the hydrophobic amino acids are missing from one end of the chain. Which of the following best depicts the tertiary structures of the two proteins in water? The diagrams in the options are not drawn to the same scale as those in Figure 1 and Figure 2.",
