    "description": "In sweet pea plants, purple flower color is dominant over red flower color and long pollen grain shape is dominant over round pollen grain shape. Two sweet pea plants that are heterozygous for both flower color and pollen grain shape are crossed with one another. A geneticist is surprised to observe that there are far fewer round, purple offspring and long, red offspring than were predicted by the <math alttext=\"9 to 3, to 3, to 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo>:</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>:</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>:</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math> expected phenotypic ratio.",
