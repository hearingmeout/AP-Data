    "description": "Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate and is observed in each of the three domains. The hexokinase family of enzymes is required during glycolysis to phosphorylate six-carbon sugars. Researchers designed a general hexokinase inhibitor that is effective in the neurons of rats.",
    "question": "Which of the following best predicts the effect of adding this inhibitor to a culture of plant cells?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Plant cells will be unaffected by the inhibitor as they do not perform glycolysis.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Plant cells will be unable to perform glycolysis due to the inhibitor and will die.",

      {
        "label": "Plant cells will be unable to perform photosynthesis due to the inhibitor and will die.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Plant cells will still be able to perform glycolysis since plant hexokinase is not structurally similar to animal hexokinase.",
