    "description": "In fruit flies, sepia eyes and ebony body are traits that display autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance. To investigate whether the traits are genetically linked, students cross wild-type flies with a line of flies that have sepia eyes and ebony bodies. The students observe that all the flies in the <math alttext=\"F 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>1</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> generation have normal eyes and normal bodies. The students allow the flies in the <math alttext=\"F 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>1</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> generation to mate and produce an <math alttext=\"F 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> generation. The students then record observations for the flies in the <math alttext=\"F 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msub><mtext></mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> generation and use the data to perform a chi-square goodness-of-fit test for a model of independent assortment. The setup for the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is presented in Table 1.",
