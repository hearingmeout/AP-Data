Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. In plants, genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis are located in both the nucleus and chloroplasts. Some variegated plants (with both green and white leaves and shoots) have mutations that prevent them from synthesizing chlorophyll throughout their leaves. In an effort to understand the genetics underlying chlorophyll synthesis, scientists performed the crosses shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Crosses of flowers on a variegated plant and the resulting progeny (a) Describe how genetic information is carried in chloroplasts and mitochondria.",
