    "description": "The enzyme lactase aids in the digestion of lactose, a sugar found in the milk of most mammals. In most mammal species, adults do not produce lactase. Continuing to produce lactase into adulthood in people is called lactase persistence. A number of different alleles have been identified that result in lactase persistence. Figure 1 shows the percentage of people in different geographic areas parts of the Old World that exhibit lactase persistence.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Distribution of lactase persistence in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia Which of the following best explains the distribution of lactase persistence in the areas shown in Figure 1 ?",
