    "question": "The peppered moth, Biston betularia was generally white in color with black speckles. Over time a more solid black moth became the more common variety. Which of the following best explains the relationship between wing pigmentation and the coloration of a moth’s surroundings?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The frequencies of the different phenotypes in the moth population changed randomly due to genetic drift.",

      {
        "label": "If the surroundings of the peppered moth became darker, those backgrounds conferred a selective advantage to a black variety, as described by natural selection.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There was a gene flow of the black variety, spreading it throughout the moth’s normal range.",

        "label": "The black variety was a nineteenth century mutation, dominant to the peppered variety. The allele for the peppered trait, being recessive, decreased in frequency over time",
