The plasmids were then introduced into a line of T lymphocytes (Figure 1), and the cells were allowed to grow for a short while. Because the regulatory sequences of the <math alttext=\"C D 3 gamma\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mtext>CD3</mtext><mi>γ</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> gene immediately precede the luciferase gene in the plasmids, the activity, either positive or negative, of the regulatory sequences affected the amount of luciferase gene expression by the T lymphocytes.
