    "description": "Climate change is disrupting the length of winter in various ecosystems, resulting in less snowfall and milder winters. Scientists in Finland have been observing the tawny owl, a fairly large owl species that is commonly found in woodlands across much of Europe and Asia. Typically, the feathers of the upper body are either brown (<math alttext=\"uppercase B uppercase B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>) or gray (<math alttext=\"lowercase b lowercase b\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>b</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>). Scientists studying tawny owls in Finland have found that the percentage of tawny owls that have brown feathers has increased over the past 28 years.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains why the brown-feathered phenotype in tawny owls has increased over the past 28 years?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Since the brown genotype is dominant, it will eventually eliminate the recessive gray genotype from the population.",

      {
        "label": "Darker feather color in tawny owls makes them less visible to predators as they sit in the trees.",

      },
      {
        "label": "With milder winters, the advantage of gray feathers that blend into a snowy environment has decreased.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The directional selection toward a darker phenotype is random and likely due to a bottleneck event.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "With milder winters, the advantage of gray feathers that blend into a snowy environment has decreased."
