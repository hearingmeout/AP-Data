    "description": "Scientists investigated the role that beak depth plays in the ability of one species of seed-eating finch to reproduce. The scientists calculated the average beak depth of finches in mating pairs and then observed whether or not the pairs produced at least one offspring that survived to the next season. The data are represented in Figure 1.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Beak depth and offspring survival in a species of finch Based on the data in Figure 1, which of the following best describes the concept illustrated?",
