    "description": "Interactions among populations determine how they access resources within a community. In Costa Rica, two different species of mites, Rhinoseius colwelli and Rhinoseius richardsoni, exhibit a high degree of interspecies competition. Both mite species live within the flowers of plants, and adult male mites tend to kill mites if they belong to a different species. An experiment was carried out to determine whether these aggressive interactions have resulted in niche partitioning by R. colwelli and R. richardsoni, of different flower species, with each mite species living in different plant species. The results are summarized in Figure 1.",
