    "description": "Soluble reactive phosphate (<math alttext=\"S R P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>SRP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) is a term used to describe the amount of phosphate available for uptake by living things. A study of river plants species and water phosphate levels was completed in Great Britain. Recently, in a section of one of the rivers studied, a population of fennel-leaved pondweed was replaced by spiked water-milfoil, even though these two plants are associated with different environmental conditions as indicated in the table below.",

Which of the following observations would best support this alternative hypothesis?",
