    "description": "In an experiment, three different animals were exposed to a series of environmental temperatures and their body temperatures were assessed at multiple temperature points between 10 and 40 degrees Celsius. Ten different individuals of each type of animal were included in the study to produce an average body temperature profile for each type of animal. Figure 1 shows the data collected.",
