Model of a typical action potential in a neuron Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that can activate an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron (Figures <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>). A researcher is investigating the effect of a particular neurotoxin that causes the amount of acetylcholine released from presynaptic neurons to increase. (a) Describe the immediate effect of the neurotoxin on the number of action potentials in a postsynaptic neuron. Predict whether the maximum membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron will increase, decrease, or stay the same.",
