The figure shows a cell membrane with an embedded structure that looks like a circle from which one pie-shaped wedge is missing. The missing wedge is on the face of the circle that is outside the cell. Two different shapes are shown outside the cell, and a portion of each shape is complementary in shape to the missing wedge of the circle. An arrow points from each shape to the missing wedge of the circle. Inside the cell, an arrow points from the embedded circle to a large dot, and another arrow points from the dot to a small square.",
