    "question": "Figure 1 represents the feeding relationships between selected organisms in the Chesapeake Bay. Decades of overharvesting have reduced the populations of both blue crabs and rockfish. However, recent efforts have increased the number of rockfish in the bay. Based on Figure 1, what is the most likely result of the increase in rockfish?",
