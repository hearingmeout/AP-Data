Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. The following models represent all the interacting species in two different communities with some of the same species and feeding relationships. These models assume that both communities have the same initial biomass. The models can be used to understand the effects of human activities on the communities. Figure 1. Models of two different communities with some of the same species (a) Describe a characteristic of a community that makes a species invasive in that community but not invasive in a different community.",
