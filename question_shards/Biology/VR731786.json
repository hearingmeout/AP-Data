    "question": "To test the effect of different abiotic factors on the macromolecule content of bacterial cells, researchers grew identical samples of bacterial cells on growth media in which the amount of nitrates and phosphates differed. The amounts of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in each sample of cells were then determined (Figure 1). Based on Figure 1, use of which of the following growth media resulted in a decrease in the amount of protein but an increase in the amount of lipids compared with the control?",
