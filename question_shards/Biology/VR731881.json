    "question": "In a certain type of fat cells, cold temperatures trigger a series of events that include changes to the structure of the mitochondria. A model of a mitochondrion from these fat cells under normal environmental conditions and when experiencing cold-induced stress is shown in Figure 1. Which of the following best explains how the changes in mitochondrial structure observed when the cell experiences cold-induced stress affect cellular respiration?",
