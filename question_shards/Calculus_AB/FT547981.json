For each k > 0, the region (not shown) enclosed by the graphs of h and g is the base of a solid with square cross sections perpendicular to the x-axis. There is a value of k for which the volume of this solid is equal to 15. Write, but do not solve, an equation involving an integral expression that could be used to find the value of k.",
