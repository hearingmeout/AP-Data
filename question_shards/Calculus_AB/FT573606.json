    "question": "On a certain day, the rate at which material is deposited at a recycling center is modeled by the function R, where R(t) is measured in tons per hour and t is the number of hours since the center opened. Using a trapezoidal sum with the three subintervals indicated by the data in the table, what is the approximate number of tons of material deposited in the first 9 hours since the center opened?",
