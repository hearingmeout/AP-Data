From left to right, the slopes of each row of segments gradually increases. The top row of segments begins with a horizontal segment then the segments gradually increase slope. The middle 13 rows of segments gradually increase slope from negative slopes to a horizontal segment to positive slopes. The horizontal segments occur on the line y equals negative x. The bottom row of segments begins with a steep negative slope then gradually increases slope to a horizontal segment.",

From left to right, the slopes of each row of segments gradually increases. In the top two rows, the slopes of the segments are always positive and gradually increasing. In rows 3 through 13, the rows of segments gradually increase slope from negative slopes to positive slopes. As the rows approach the x axis, each row begins with a steeper negative slope and the x coordinate of the change in slope from negative to positive slopes increases toward x equals zero. In the bottom two rows, the slopes of the segments are always positive and gradually increasing. The slopes of segments in the first and fourth quadrants are always positive.",
