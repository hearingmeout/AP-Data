    "question": "The function h is defined on the closed interval [−1, 3]. The graph of h', the derivative of h, is shown above. The graph consists of two semicircles with a common endpoint at x = 1. Which of the following statements about h must be true? h(−1) = h(3) h is continuous at x = 1. The graph of h has a vertical asymptote at x = 1.",
