It moves upward and to the right, crosses the x axis at approximately negative 1.2, and reaches a maximum at the point with coordinates that are approximately negative .7 comma .5. The curve then moves downward and to the right, crosses through the origin, and reaches a minimum at the point with coordinates that are approximately .7 comma negative .5. The curve then moves upward and to the right, crosses the x axis at approximately 1.2, and ends above the x axis and to the right of the y axis.",
