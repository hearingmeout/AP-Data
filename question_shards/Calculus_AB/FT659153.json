A tightrope walker, walking at a constant rate of 2 feet per second from point A to point B, is illuminated by a spotlight 70 feet above point A, as shown in the diagram. (a) How fast is the shadow of the tightrope walker's feet moving along the ground when she is midway between the buildings? (Indicate units of measure.)",
