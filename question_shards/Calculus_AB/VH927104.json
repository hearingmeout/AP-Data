An x value greater than zero is labeled a, on the x axis to the right of the origin. The three curves are labeled f of x, g of x, and h of x over an x interval containing the value, a. In the figure, the three curves intersect at the point directly above the x value a. The point of intersection is marked by a closed circle. The curve h of x lies above the curve g of x. The curve f of x begins between the curve h of x and the curve g of x, and passes through both curves several times. The curve h of x starts high on the y axis above the origin O. It first moves downward and to the right until it touches the closed circle from above, and it then moves upward and to the right. The curve g of x starts on the y axis below the point where the graph f of x starts. It first moves upward and to the right until it touches the closed circle from below, and it then moves downward and to the right. The curve f of x starts on the y axis approximately halfway between where the curve h of x, and the curve g of x starts. It first moves upward and to the right, crossing the curve h of x, reaches a local maximum, and then moves downward crossing the curve h of x again, then crossing the g of x curve before reaching a local minimum. It then moves upward and to the right, passing through the closed circle. It continues to move upward and to the right, reaching a local maximum, then moving downward and to the right. It crosses the curve h of x, crosses the curve g of x, and ends far below the x axis, below the curve g of x.",
