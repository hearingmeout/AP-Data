It moves downward and to the right, and crosses the y axis above the origin. It continues downward until it reaches an open circle at a point where x equals 3, just above the x axis. The second line segment begins at the open circle, and moves upward and to the right until it ends to the right of the y axis, and above the x axis.",

The first curve begins to the left of the y axis, and just above the x axis. It moves very gradually upward and to the right at first. It crosses the y axis just above the origin. It continues upward, and becomes increasingly steeper as it approaches a dashed vertical line at x equals 3. The curve continues almost vertically until it ends at the top edge of the visible portion of the plane. The second curve begins just to the right of the dashed vertical line at x equals 3, near the top edge of the visible portion of the plane, and moves almost vertically downward. It then begins to level off as it approaches the x axis, and ends to the right of the y axis, and just above the x axis.",
