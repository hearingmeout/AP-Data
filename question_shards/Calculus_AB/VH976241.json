The graph of f of x is a curve that begins at a local minimum at the point with approximate coordinates negative 2 comma negative 1. It moves steeply upward and to the right, crosses the x axis just to the right of negative 2, and continues upward until it levels off and reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates negative 1.4 comma 2.4. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a local minimum at the point with approximate coordinates negative 0.7 comma 0.3. The curve then moves upward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a local maximum on the y axis at 1. It then moves downward and to the right, crosses the x axis just to the right of 1, and levels off at a local minimum just below the x axis where x equals 1.3. The curve then moves upward and to the right, crosses the x axis about halfway between 1 and 2, and continues upward and to the right until it ends at the point with approximate coordinates 2 comma 1.

It moves downward and to the right, and levels off, becoming nearly horizontal and intersecting the graph of f of x on the y axis at 1. It continues nearly horizontally at first before moving steeply upward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 1.3 comma 2.8. It then moves steeply downward and to the right, intersects the graph of f of x, crosses the x axis just to the left of 2, and ends below the x axis where x equals 2.",
