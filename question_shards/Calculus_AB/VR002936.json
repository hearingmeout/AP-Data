The second curve begins in quadrant 1, just to the right of the dashed vertical line at x equals 1, and moves steeply downward and to the right at first. It begins to level off as it approaches the dashed horizontal line at y equals 2, and continues almost horizontally to the right until it ends, just above the dashed horizontal line.",
