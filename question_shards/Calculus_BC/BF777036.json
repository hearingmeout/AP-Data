Directly above the open circle, is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 6. The first line segment begins at the closed circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 6, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 4 comma 5, and ends at the point with coordinates 5 comma 4. The second line segment begins where the first line segment ends, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends to the right of the point with coordinates 6 comma 4.",
