    "question": "Water is flowing into a tank at the rate r(t), where r(t) is measured in gallons per minute and t is measured in minutes. The tank contains 15 gallons of water at time t = 0. Values of r(t) for selected values of t are given in the table above. Using a trapezoidal sum with the three intervals indicated by the table, what is the approximation of the number of gallons of water in the tank at time t = 9 ?",
