    "description": "The penguin population on an island is modeled by a differentiable function P of time t, where P(t) is the number of penguins and t is measured in years for 0 ≤ t ≤ 40. There are 100,000 penguins on the island at time t = 0. The birth rate for the penguins on the island is modeled by\n\nB(t) = 1000e0.06t penguins per year\n\nand the death rate for the penguins on the island is modeled by\n\nD(t)=250e0.1t penguins per year.",
