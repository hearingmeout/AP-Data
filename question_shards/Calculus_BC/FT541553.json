    "description": "The twice-differentiable function W models the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, where W(t) is measured in (GL) and t is measured in days. The table above gives values of W '(t) sampled at various times during the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 30 days. At time t = 30, the reservoir contains 125 gigaliters of water.",
    "question": "Use the tangent line approximation to W at time t = 30 to predict the volume of water W(t), in gigaliters, in the reservoir at time t = 32. Show the computations that lead to your answer.",
