    "description": "The twice-differentiable function W models the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, where W(t) is measured in (GL) and t is measured in days. The table above gives values of W '(t) sampled at various times during the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 30 days. At time t = 30, the reservoir contains 125 gigaliters of water.",
    "question": "The equation A = 0.3W2/3 gives the relationship between the area A, in square kilometers, of the surface of the reservoir, and the volume of the water W(t), in gigaliters, in the reservoir. Find the instantaneous rate of change of A, in square kilometer per day, with respect to t when t = 30 days.",
