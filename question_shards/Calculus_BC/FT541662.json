    "description": "A particle moves along the x-axis so that its velocity at time t, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 6, is given by a differentiable function v whose graph is shown above. The velocity is 0 at t = 0, t = 3, and t = 5, and the graph has horizontal tangents at t = 1 and t = 4. The areas of the regions bounded by the t-axis and the graph of v on the intervals [0, 3], [3, 5], and [5, 6] are 8, 3, and 2, respectively. At time t = 0, the particle is at x = -2.",
