    "description": "The temperature of water in a tub at time t is modeled by a strictly increasing, twice-differentiable function W, where W(t) is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and t is measured in minutes. At time t = 0, the temperature of the water is 55° F. The water is heated for 30 minutes, beginning at time t = 0. Values of W(t) at selected times t for the first 20 minutes are given in the table above.",
