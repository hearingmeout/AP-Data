    "description": "A toy train moves along a straight set up on a table. The position x(t) of the train at the time t seconds is measured in centimeters from the center of the track. At time t=1 , the train is 6 centimeters to the left of the center, so x(1)=−6 . For 0≤t≤4 , the velocity of the train at the time t is given by v(t)=3t2−12, where v(t) is measured in centimeters per second.",
