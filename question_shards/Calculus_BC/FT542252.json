    "description": "A toy train moves along a straight set up on a table. The position x(t) of the train at the time t seconds is measured in centimeters from the center of the track. At time t=1 , the train is 6 centimeters to the left of the center, so x(1)=−6 . For 0≤t≤4 , the velocity of the train at the time t is given by v(t)=3t2−12, where v(t) is measured in centimeters per second.",
    "question": "A toy bus moving on the same table has the same position given by (x(t),y(t)) . Here, x(t) is the function found in part (a), and y(t)=2+12 sin (t/4) is the distance from the bus to the train track, in centimeters. Write, but do not evaluate, an integral equation that gives the total distance traveled by the bus during the time interval 0≤t≤4 .",
