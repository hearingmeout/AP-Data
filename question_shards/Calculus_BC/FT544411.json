    "description": "Let R and S in the figure above be defined as follows: R is the region in the first and second quadrants bounded by the graphs of y = 3 - x2 and y = 2x. S is the shaded region in the first quadrant bounded by the two graphs, the x-axis, and the y-axis.",
    "question": "The region R is the base of a solid. For this solid, each cross section perpendicular to the x-axis is an isosceles right triangle with one leg across the base of the solid. Write, but do not evaluate, an integral expression that gives the volume of the solid.",
