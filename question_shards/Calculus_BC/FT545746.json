    "description": "Note: Figure not drawn to scale.\n\nThe figure above shows a spotlight shining on point P(x,y) on the shoreline of Crescent Island. The spotlight is located at the origin and is rotating. The portion of the shoreline on which the spotlight shines is in the shape of the parabola y = x2 from the point (1,1) to the point (5,25) . Let θ be the angle between the beam of light and the positive x-axis.",
