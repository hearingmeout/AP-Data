    "description": "Note: Figure not drawn to scale.\n\nThe figure above shows a spotlight shining on point P(x,y) on the shoreline of Crescent Island. The spotlight is located at the origin and is rotating. The portion of the shoreline on which the spotlight shines is in the shape of the parabola y = x2 from the point (1,1) to the point (5,25) . Let θ be the angle between the beam of light and the positive x-axis.",
    "question": "If the spotlight is rotating at the rate of one revolution per minute, how fast is the point P traveling along the shoreline at the instant it is at the point (3,9) ?",
