    "description": "A circle is inscribed in a square as shown in the figure above. The circumference of the circle is increasing at a constant rate of 6 inches per second. As the circle expands, the square expands to maintain the condition of tangency. (Note: A circle with radius r has circumference  C=2πr and area A=πr2 )",
    "question": "At the instant when the area of the circle is 25π square inches, find the rate of increase in the area enclosed between the circle and the square. Indicate units of measure.",
