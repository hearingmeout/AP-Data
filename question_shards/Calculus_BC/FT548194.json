    "description": "Let f be a function that is continuous on the interval [0, 4). The function f is twice differentiable except at x = 2. The function f and its derivatives have the properties indicated in the table above, where DNE indicates that the derivatives of f do not exist at x = 2.",
    "question": "For 0 < x < 4, find all values of x at which f has a relative extremum. Determine whether f has a maximum or a relative minimum at each of these values. Justify your answer.",
