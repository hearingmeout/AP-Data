    "description": "A zoo sponsored a one-day contest to name a new baby elephant. Zoo visitors deposited entries in a special box between noon (t=0) and 8 P.M. (t=8) . The number of entries in the box t hours after noon is modeled by a differentiable function E for 0 ≤ t ≤ 8  Values of E(t) , in hundreds of entries, at various times t are shown in the table above.",
    "question": "At 8 P.M, volunteers began to process the entries. They processed the entries at a rate modeled by the function P, where P(t)=t3-30t2+298t-976 hundreds of entries per hour for 8≤t≤12 . According to the model, how many entries had not yet been processed by midnight (t=12) ?",
