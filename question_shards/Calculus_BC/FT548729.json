    "description": "A zoo sponsored a one-day contest to name a new baby elephant. Zoo visitors deposited entries in a special box between noon (t=0) and 8 P.M. (t=8) . The number of entries in the box t hours after noon is modeled by a differentiable function E for 0 ≤ t ≤ 8  Values of E(t) , in hundreds of entries, at various times t are shown in the table above.",
    "question": "According to the model from part (c), at what time were the entries being processed most quickly? Justify your answer.",
