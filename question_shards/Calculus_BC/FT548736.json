    "description": "There are 700 people in line for a popular amusement-park ride when the ride begins operation in the morning. Once it begins operation, the ride accepts passengers until the park closes 8 hours later. While there is a line, people move onto the ride at a rate of 800 people per hour. The graph above shows the rate, r(t) , at which people arrive at the ride throughout the day. Time t is measured in hours from the time the ride begins operation.",
    "question": "At what time t is the line for the ride the longest? How many people are in line at that time? Justify your answers.",
