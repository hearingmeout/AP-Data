    "description": "There are 700 people in line for a popular amusement-park ride when the ride begins operation in the morning. Once it begins operation, the ride accepts passengers until the park closes 8 hours later. While there is a line, people move onto the ride at a rate of 800 people per hour. The graph above shows the rate, r(t) , at which people arrive at the ride throughout the day. Time t is measured in hours from the time the ride begins operation.",
    "question": "Write, but do not solve, an equation involving an integral expression of r whose solution gives the earliest time t at which there is no longer a line for the ride.",
