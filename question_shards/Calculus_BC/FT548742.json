    "question": "Region R is the base of a solid. For each y, where 0 ≤y ≤6 the cross section of the solid taken perpendicular to the y-axis is a rectangle whose height is 3 times the length of its base in region R. Write, but do not evaluate, an integral expression that gives the volume of the solid.",
