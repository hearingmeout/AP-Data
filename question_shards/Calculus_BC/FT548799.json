    "description": "As a pot of tea cools, the temperature of the tea is modeled by a differentiable function H for 0 ≤ t ≤ 10, where time t is measured in minutes and temperature H(t) is measured in degrees Celsius. Values of H(t) at selected values of time t are shown in the table above.",
    "question": "Use the data in the table to approximate the rate at which the temperature of the tea is changing at time t = 3.5. Show the computations that lead to your answer.",
