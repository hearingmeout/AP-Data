    "description": "At the beginning of 2010, a landfill contained 1400 tons of solid waste. The increasing function W models the total amount of solid waste stored at the landfill. Planners estimate that W will satisfy the differential equation \\(\\frac{dW}{dt}=\\frac{1}{25}\\left(W-300\\right)\\) for the next 20 years. W is measured in tons, and t is measured in years from the start of 2010.",
    "question": "Find d2W/dt2 in terms of W. Use d2W/dt2 to determine whether your answer in part (a) is an underestimate or an overestimate of the amount of solid waste that the landfill contains at time t =1/4 .",
