    "description": "The rate at which a baby bird gains weight is proportional to the difference between its adult weight and its current weight. At time t = 0, when the bird is first weighed, its weight is 20 grams. If B(t) is the weight of the bird, in grams, at time t days after it is first weighed, then\n\n\\(\\frac{dB}{dt}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left(100-B\\right)\\).\n\nLet y = B(t) be the solution to the differential equation above with initial condition B(0) = 20.",
