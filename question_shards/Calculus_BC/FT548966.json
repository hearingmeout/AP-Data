    "description": "On a certain workday, the rate, in tons per hour, at which unprocessed gravel arrives at a gravel processing plant is modeled by G(t) = 90 + 45cos(t2 /18) , where t is measured in hours and 0 ≤ t ≤ 8 . At the beginning of the workday (t = 0) , the plant has 500 tons of unprocessed gravel. During the hours of operation,0 ≤ t ≤ 8 , the plant processes gravel at a constant rate of 100 tons per hour.",
