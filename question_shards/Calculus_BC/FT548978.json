    "description": "Hot water is dripping through a coffeemaker, filling a large cup with coffee. The amount of coffee in the cup at time t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 6, is given by a differentiable function C, where t is measured in minutes. Selected values of C(t), measured in ounces, are given in the table above.",
