    "description": "The figure above shows the graph of f' the derivative of a twice-differentiable function f, on the closed interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 8 . The graph of f' has horizontal tangent lines at x=1, x=3, and x=5. The areas of the regions between the graph of f' and the x-axis are labeled in the figure. The function f is defined for all real numbers and satisfied f(8)=4.",
    "question": "On what open intervals contained in 0<x<8 is the graph of f both concave down and increasing? Explain your reasoning.",
