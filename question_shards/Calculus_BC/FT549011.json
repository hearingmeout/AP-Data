    "description": "Grass clippings are placed in a bin, where they decompose. For 0 ≤ t ≤ 30 , the amount of grass clippings remaining in the bin is modeled by A(t) = 6.687(0.931)t , where A(t) is measured in pounds and t is measured in days.",
    "question": "For t>30, L(t) , the linear approximation to A at t=30, is a better model for the amount of grass clippings remaining in the bin. Use L(t) to predict the time at which there will be 0.5 pound of grass clippings remaining in the bin. Show the work that leads to your answer.",
