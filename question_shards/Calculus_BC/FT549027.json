    "description": "Train A runs back and forth on an east-west section of railroad track. Train A's velocity, measured in meters per minute, is given by a differentiable function vA(t) , where time t is measured in minutes. Selected values for vA(t) are given in the table above.",
    "question": "At time t = 2, train A's position is 300 meters east of the Origin Station, and the train is moving to the east. Write an expression involving an integral that gives the position of train A, in meters from the Origin Station, at time t = 12. Use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals indicated by the table to approximate the position of the train at time t = 12.",
