    "description": "Train A runs back and forth on an east-west section of railroad track. Train A's velocity, measured in meters per minute, is given by a differentiable function vA(t) , where time t is measured in minutes. Selected values for vA(t) are given in the table above.",
    "question": "A second train, train B, travels north from the Origin Station. At time t the velocity of train B is given by vB(t) = -5t2 + 60t + 25, and at time t = 2 the train is 400 meters north of the station. Find the rate, in meters per minute, at which the distance between train A and train B is changing at time t = 2.",
