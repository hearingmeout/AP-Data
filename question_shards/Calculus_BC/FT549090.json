    "description": "The figure above shows the graph of f', the derivative of a twice-differentiable function f, on the interval [–3, 4]. The graph of f' has horizontal tangents at x = –1, x = 1, and x = 3. The areas of the regions bounded by the x-axis and the graph of f' on the intervals [–2, 1] and [1, 4] are 9 and 12, respectively.",
    "question": "Find all x-coordinates at which f has a relative maximum. Give a reason for your answer.",
