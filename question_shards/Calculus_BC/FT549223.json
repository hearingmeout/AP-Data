The function meets the following requirements.\n\n(i) At x=0, the value of the function is 0, and the slope of the graph of the function is 0.\n\n(ii) At x=4, the value of the function is 1, and the slope of the graph of the function is 1.\n\n(iii) Between x=0 and x=4, the function is increasing.",
