    "description": "The wind chill is the temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit (oF), a human feels based on the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind velocity v, in miles per hour (mph). If the air temperature is 32 oF, then the wind chill is given by W(v)=55.6-22.1v0.16 and is valid for 5 ≤ v ≤60.",
    "question": "Over the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 hours, the air temperature is a constant 32oF. At time t=0, the wind velocity is v=20 mph. If the wind velocity increases at a constant rate of 5 mph per hour, what is the rate of change of the wind chill with respect to time at t=3 hours? Indicate units of measure.",
