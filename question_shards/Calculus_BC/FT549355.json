    "description": "The temperature of water in a tub at time t is modeled by a strictly increasing, twice-differentiable function W, where W(t) is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and t is measured in minutes. At time t=0, the temperature of the water is 55oF. The water is heated for 30 minutes, beginning at time t=0. Values of W(t) at selected times t for the first 20 minutes are given in the table above.",
    "question": "Use the data in the table to estimate W'(12). Show the computations that lead to your answer. Using correct units, interpret the meaning of your answer in the context of this problem.",
