    "description": "A storm washed away sand from a beach, causing the edge of the water to get closer to a nearby road. The rate at which the distance between the road and the edge of the water was changing during the storm is modeled by \\(f\\left(t\\right)=\\sqrt{t}+\\cos t-3\\) meters per hour, t hours after the storm began. The edge of the water was 35 meters from the road when the storm began, and the storm lasted 5 hours. The derivative of f(t) is \\(f'\\left(t\\right)=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{t}}-\\sin t\\).",
    "question": "At what time during the 5 hours of the storm was the distance between the road and the edge of the water decreasing most rapidly? Justify your answer.",
