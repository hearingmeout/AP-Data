    "description": "Let f be a twice-differentiable function defined on the interval -1.2<x<3.2 with f(1)=2. The graph of f', the derivative of f, is shown above. The graph of f' crosses the x-axis at x=-1 and x=3 and has a horizontal tangent at x=2. Let g be the function given by g(x)=e f(x) .",
    "question": "Find the average rate of change of g', the derivative of g, over the interval [1, 3].",
