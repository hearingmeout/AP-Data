    "description": "The velocity of a particle moving along the x-axis is modeled by a differentiable function v, where the position x is measured in meters, and time t is measured in seconds. Selected values of v(t) are given in the table above. The particle is at position x=7 meters when t=0 seconds.",
    "question": "Suppose that the acceleration of the particle is positive for 0<t<8 seconds. Explain why the position of the particle at t=8 seconds must be greater than x=30 meters.",
