    "description": "The figure above shows an above ground swimming pool in the shape of a cylinder with a radius of 12 feet and a height of 4 feet. The pool contains 1000 cubic feet of water at time t =0. During the time interval <math> <mrow> <mn> 0 </mn> <mo> ≤ </mo> <mi> t </mi> <mo> ≤ </mo> <mn> 12 </mn> </mrow> </math> hours, water is pumped into the pool at the rate P ( t ) cubic feet per hour. The table above gives values of P ( t ) for selected values of t . During the same time interval, water is leaking from the pool at the rate R ( t ) cubic feet per hour, where R ( t )=25e -0.05 t .\n\n(Note: The volume V of a cylinder with radius r and height h is given by V = <math> <mi> π </mi> </math> r 2 h .)",
