    "description": "A cylindrical can of radius 10 millimeters is used to measure rainfall in Stormville. The can is initially empty, and rain enters the can during a 60-day period. The height of water in the can is modeled by the function S , where S ( t ) is measured in millimeters and t is measured in days for <math> <mrow> <mn> 0 </mn> <mo> ≤ </mo> <mi> t </mi> <mo> ≤ </mo> <mn> 60 </mn> </mrow> </math> . The rate at which the height of the water is rising in the can is given by S '( t )=2sin(0.03 t )+1.5.",
    "question": "According to the model, what is the average rate of change in the height of water in the can over the 60-day period? Show the computations that lead to your answer. Indicate units of measure.",
