    "description": "A cylindrical can of radius 10 millimeters is used to measure rainfall in Stormville. The can is initially empty, and rain enters the can during a 60-day period. The height of water in the can is modeled by the function S , where S ( t ) is measured in millimeters and t is measured in days for <math> <mrow> <mn> 0 </mn> <mo> ≤ </mo> <mi> t </mi> <mo> ≤ </mo> <mn> 60 </mn> </mrow> </math> . The rate at which the height of the water is rising in the can is given by S '( t )=2sin(0.03 t )+1.5.",
    "question": "During the same 60-day period, rain on Monsoon Mountain accumulates in a can identical to the one in Stormville. The height of the water in the can on Monsoon Mountain is modeled by the function M, where M(t)=1 / 400 (3t3-30t2+330t). The height M(t) is measured in millimeters, and t is measured in days for 0 ≤ t≤ 60 . Let D(t)=M'(t)-S'(t). Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to the function D on the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 60 to justify that there exists a time t, 0<t<60, at which the heights of water in the two cans are changing at the same rate.",
