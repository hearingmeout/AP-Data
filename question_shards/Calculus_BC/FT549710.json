    "description": "Ben rides a unicycle back and forth along a straight east-west track. The twice-differentiable function B models Ben's position on the track, measured in meters from the western end of the track, at time t, measured in seconds from the start of the ride. The table above gives values for B(t) and Ben's velocity, v(t), measured in meters per second, at selected times t.",
    "question": "For 40≤t≤60 , must there be a time t when Ben's velocity is 2 meters per second? Justify your answer.",
