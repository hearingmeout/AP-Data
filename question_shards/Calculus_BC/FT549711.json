    "description": "Ben rides a unicycle back and forth along a straight east-west track. The twice-differentiable function B models Ben's position on the track, measured in meters from the western end of the track, at time t, measured in seconds from the start of the ride. The table above gives values for B(t) and Ben's velocity, v(t), measured in meters per second, at selected times t.",
    "question": "A light is directly above the western end of the track. Ben rides so that at time t, the distance L(t) between Ben and the light satisfies (L(t))2 = 122+(B(t))2. At what rate is the distance between Ben and the light changing at time t=40?",
