    "description": "Oil is being pumped continuously from a certain oil well at a rate proportional to the amount of oil left in the well; that is,dy/dt=ky , where y is the amount of oil left in the well at any time t. Initially there were 1,000,000 gallons of oil in the well, and 6 years later there were 500,000 gallons remaining. It will no longer be profitable to pump oil when there are fewer than 50,000 gallons remaining.",
    "question": "At what rate is the amount of oil in the well decreasing when there are 600,000 gallons of oil remaining?",
