    "description": "Caren rides her bicycle along a straight road from home to school, starting at home at time t=0 minutes and arriving at school at time t=12 minutes. During the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 12 minutes, her velocity v(t) , in miles per minute, is modeled by the piecewise-linear function whose graph is shown above.",
    "question": "Shortly after leaving home, Caren realizes she left her calculus homework at home, and she returns to get it. At what time does she turn around to go back home? Give a reason for your answer.",
