    "description": "The rate at which people enter an auditorium for a rock concert is modeled by the function R given by \\(R(t)=1380t^2-675t^3\\) for \\(0\\le t\\le2\\) hours; R(t) is measured in people per hour. No one is in the auditorium at time t = 0, when the doors open. The doors close and the concert begins at time t = 2.",
