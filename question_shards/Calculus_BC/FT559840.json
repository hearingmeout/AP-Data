    "description": "When a certain grocery store opens, it has 50 pounds of bananas on a display table. Customers remove bananas from the display table at a rate modeled by \n\n\\(f\\left(t\\right)=10+\\left(0.8t\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{t^3}{100}\\right)\\) for \\(0 < t\\le12,\\)\n\nwhere f(t) is measured in pounds per hour and t is the number of hours after the store opened. After the store has been open for three hours, store employees add bananas to the display table at a rate modeled by\n\n\\(g\\left(t\\right)=3+2.4\\ln\\left(t^2+2t\\right)\\) for \\(3 < t\\le12,\\)\n\nwhere g(t) is measured in pounds per hour and t is the number of hours after the store opened.",
