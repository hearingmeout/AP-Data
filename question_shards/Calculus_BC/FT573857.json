    "question": "The function f ( θ ) = θ3 − 6θ2 + 9θ satisfies f (q) ≥ 0 for θ ≥ 0. During the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 2p seconds, a particle moves along the polar curve r = f (θ) so that at time t seconds, θ = t. On what intervals of time t is the distance between the particle and the origin increasing?",
