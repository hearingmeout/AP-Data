The function meets the following requirements.\n\n(i) At x = 0, the value of the function is 0, and the slope of the graph of the function is 0.\n\n(ii) At x = 4, the value of the function is 1, and the slope of the graph of the function is 1.\n\n(iii) Between x = 0 and x = 4, the function is increasing.\n\n(a) Let f(x) = ax2, where a is a nonzero constant. Show that it is not possible to find a value for a so that f meets requirement (ii) above.",
