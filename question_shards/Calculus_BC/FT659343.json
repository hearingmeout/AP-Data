    "question": "A zoo sponsored a one-day contest to name a new baby elephant. Zoo visitors deposited entries in a special box between noon (t = 0) and 8 P.M. (t = 8). The number of entries in the box t hours after noon is modeled by a differentiable function E for 0 ≤ t ≤ 8. Values of E(t), in hundreds of entries, at various times t are shown in the table above. (a) Use the data in the table to approximate the rate, in hundreds of entries per hour, at which entries were being deposited at time t = 6. Show the computations that lead to your answer.",
