    "question": "Concert tickets went on sale at noon (t = 0) and were sold out within 9 hours. The number of people waiting in line to purchase tickets at time t is modeled by a twice-differentiable function L for 0 ≤ t ≤ 9. Values of L(t) at various times t are shown in the table above.\n\n(a) Use the data in the table to estimate the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 5:30 P.M. (t = 5.5). Show the computations that lead to your answer. Indicate units of measure.",
