    "question": "The figure above shows the graph of f', the derivative of a twice-differentiable function f, on the closed interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 8. The graph of f' has horizontal tangent lines at x = 1, x = 3, and x = 5. The areas of the regions between the graph of f' and the x-axis are labeled in the figure. The function f is defined for all real numbers and satisfies f(8) = 4. (a) Find all values of x on the open interval 0 < x < 8 for which the function f has a local minimum. Justify your answer.",
