    "question": "During the same 60-day period, rain on Monsoon Mountain accumulates in a can identical to the one in Stormville. The height of the water in the can on Monsoon Mountain is modeled by the function M, where M(t)=1 / 400 (3t3-30t2+330t). The height M(t) is measured in millimeters, and t is measured in days for 0 ≤ t≤ 60 . Let D(t)=M'(t)-S'(t). Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to the function D on the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 60 to justify that there exists a time t, 0<t<60, at which the heights of water in the two cans are changing at the same rate.",
