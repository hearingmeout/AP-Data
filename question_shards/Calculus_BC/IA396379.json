    "question": "A toy bus moving on the same table has the same position given by (x(t),y(t)) . Here, x(t) is the function found in part (a), and y(t)=2+12 sin (t/4) is the distance from the bus to the train track, in centimeters. Write, but do not evaluate, an integral equation that gives the total distance traveled by the bus during the time interval 0≤t≤4 .",
