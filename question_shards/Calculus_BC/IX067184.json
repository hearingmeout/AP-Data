    "question": "Recall that the volumetric flow is the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity of the water at a location. To prevent flooding, water must be diverted if the average value of the volumetric flow at Picnic Point exceeds 2100 cubic feet per minute for a 20-minute period. Using your answer from part (c), find the average value of the volumetric flow during the time interval 40 ≤ t ≤ 60 minutes. Does this value indicate that the water must be diverted?",
