    "question": "During a certain epidemic, the number of people that are infected at any time increases at a rate proportional to the number of people that are infected at that time. If 1,000 people are infected when the epidemic is first discovered, and 1,200 are infected 7 days later, how many people are infected 12 days after the epidemic is first discovered?",
