The graph consists of two curves. The first curve begins just below the x axis, and to the left of the x axis. It moves almost horizontally to the right initially, and crosses the y axis just below the origin. The curve becomes increasingly steep as it approaches x equals 3, where it is almost vertical and reaches the end of the visible portion of the plane. The second curve begins high above the x axis, just to the right of x equals 3, and moves almost vertically downward initially. The curve begins to level off as it approaches the x axis, and ends just above the x axis, far to the right of the origin.",
