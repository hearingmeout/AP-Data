The vertical axis is labeled y, and the values 10, 20, and 30 are indicated. The curve begins on the y axis at 30, and moves downward and to the right, curving upward, until it reaches a point with y value approaching 20 that is about one fourth of the way along the horizontal t axis. From here, the curve moves horizontally to the right until it ends.",
