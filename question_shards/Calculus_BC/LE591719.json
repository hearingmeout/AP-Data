The graph is a curve that begins just above the x axis, and just to the left of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right and reaches a maximum above the x axis, where x equals 1. The curve then moves downward and to the right, crossing the x axis approximately halfway between 2 and 3, and levels off as it reaches a minimum below the x axis, approximately halfway between x equals 4 and x equals 5. It then moves upward and to the right, crosses the x axis just to the left of 6, and ends just above the x axis.",

The graph is a curve that begins just below the x axis, and just to the left of the y axis. It moves gradually upward and levels off at the origin. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a local minimum far below the x axis, approximately halfway between x equals 2 and x equals 3. It then moves upward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a local maximum just below the x axis, approximately one third of the way between x equals 3 and x equals 4.
