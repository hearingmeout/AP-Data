    "question": "Larry also rides his bicycle along a straight road from home to school in 12 minutes. His velocity is modeled by the function w given by w(t)=π/15sin(π/12t) , where w(t) is in miles per minute for 0 ≤ t ≤ 12 minutes. Who lives closer to school: Caren or Larry? Show the work that leads to your answer.",
