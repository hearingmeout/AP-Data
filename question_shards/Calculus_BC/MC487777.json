The curve is symmetric over the y axis. The curve begins on the x axis at negative 2 and moves upward and to the right. It then levels off, reaching a high point above the x axis, between the values x equals negative  2 and x equals negative 1. It then moves downward and to the right crossing the x axis slightly to the right of negative 1, and levels off, crossing the y axis below the origin. It then moves upward and to the right crossing the x axis again, slightly to the left of 1. It then levels off, reaching a high point above the x axis between x equals 1 and x equals 2. The curve then moves downward and to the right until it ends at 2 on the x axis.",

The curve is symmetric about the origin. The curve begins in quadrant 3 below the x axis at x equals negative 2. R moves downward and to the right until it levels off, reaching a low point between x equals negative 2 and x equals negative 1. R then moves upward and to the right passes through the origin, and levels off, reaching a high point in quadrant 1 between x equals 1 and x equals 2. On the interval on which the curve is moving upward, the curve is increasingly steep from the low point until a point slightly to the right of x equals negative 1, then becomes less steep until a point slightly left of x equals 1, then becomes steeper until leveling off at the high point.
