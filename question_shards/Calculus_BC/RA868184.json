    "question": "After the storm, a machine pumped sand back onto the beach so that the distance between the road and the edge of the water was growing at a rate of g(p) meters per day, where p is the number of days since pumping began. Write an equation involving an integral expression whose solution would give the number of days that sand must be pumped to restore the original distance between the road and the edge of the water.",
