    "question": "The wind chill is the temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit (°F), a human feels based on the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind velocity v, in miles per hour (mph). If the air temperature is 32°F, then the wind chill is given by W(v) = 55.6 - 22.1v0.16 and is valid for 5 ≤ v ≤ 60. (a) Find W'(20). Using correct units, explain the meaning of W'(20) in terms of the wind chill.",
