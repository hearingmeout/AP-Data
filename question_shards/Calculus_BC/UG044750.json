    "question": "A student proposes the function P, given by P(t) = 20 +10te(-t/3), as a model for the temperature of the water in the pond at time t, where t is measured in days and P(t) is measured in degrees Celsius. Find P'(12). Using appropriate units, explain the meaning of your answer in terms of water temperature.",
