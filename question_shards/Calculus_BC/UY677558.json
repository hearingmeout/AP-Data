    "question": "A particle travels in a straight line with a constant acceleration of 3 meters per second per second. If the velocity of the particle is 10 meters per second at time 2 seconds, how far does the particle travel during the time interval when its velocity increases from 4 meters per second to 10 meters per second?",
