The first curve begins just above the x axis and to the left of the y axis. It moves very gradually upward at first, and crosses the x axis just above the origin. As the curve approaches x equals 3, it becomes increasingly steeper until it moves almost vertically upward. A vertical dashed line is drawn at x equals 3. The second curve begins to the right of x equals 3, and moves almost vertically downward at first, before leveling off as it approaches the x axis. It ends just above the x axis.",
