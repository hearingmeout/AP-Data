The letter b is indicated on the x axis, far to the right of the origin. The curve begins below the x axis, where x equals a. It moves briefly downward and to the right then levels off and reaches a minimum below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. It then moves upward and to the right, crossing the y axis just below the origin, and crossing the x axis just to the right of the origin. It continues upward until it levels off and reaches a local maximum just above the x axis. The curve then moves downward and to the right, crossing the x axis about halfway along the axis, until it levels off and reaches a local minimum just below the x axis. It then moves steeply upward and to the right, crossing the x axis about three fourths of the way along the axis, and continues upward until it ends high above the x axis, just to the left of where x equals b.",
