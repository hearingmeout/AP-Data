    "question": "A scientist monitored the number of fish in a lake and found that the number of fish increased at a rate proportional to the number of fish present. At time <math alttext=\"t equals 0 \" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> years, there were 200 fish in the lake. At time <math alttext=\"t equals 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> years, there were 1000 fish in the lake. Which of the following is the best estimate for the number of fish in the lake at time <math alttext=\"t equals 4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> years?",
