The first line segment begins on the y axis, just above the origin, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at an open circle at x equals 2, just above the x axis. Below this open circle is a second open circle at x equals 2, just below the x axis. The second line segment begins at the second open circle, and moves upward and to the right. It crosses the x axis at 3, and ends at x equals 5, high above the x axis.",
