The curve begins far above the x axis, far to the left of the y axis, moves steeply downward and to the right, and crosses the x axis at negative 1.33. It reaches a point below the x axis, to the left of the y axis, moves upward and to the right, crosses the origin, and reaches a point above the x axis, to the right of the y axis. It then moves steeply downward and to the right, crossing the x axis at 1.33, and ending far below the x axis, far to the right of the y axis. Note that all values are approximate.",
