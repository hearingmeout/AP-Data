        "label": "The figure presents three graphs of curves in the x y coordinate plane with the origin labeled O. An x value greater than zero is labeled a, on the x axis to the right of the origin. The three curves are labeled f of x, g of x, and h of x over an x interval containing the value, a. In the figure, the three curves intersect at the point directly above the x value a. The point of intersection is marked by a closed circle. The curve h of x lies above the curve g of x. The curve h of x starts high on the y axis above the origin O. It first moves rapidly downward and to the right, passing through the closed circle, and then moves slowly downward and to the right. The curve g of x starts on the y axis below the point where the graph h of x starts. It first moves upward and to the right until it touches the closed circle from below, and it then moves downward and to the right. The curve f of x starts on the y axis slightly below the point where the curve h of x starts. It moves upward and to the right, passing the curve h of x, until it reaches its highest point. It then moves rapidly downward and to the right, staying above the other two curves, until it passes through the closed circle. It continues to move rapidly downward and to the right, falling below the other two curves, until it reaches its lowest point. It then starts to move upward and to the right, crossing the curve g of x first and then the curve h of x, and stays above the other two curves.",
