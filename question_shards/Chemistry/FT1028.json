    "question": "Gaseous cyclobutene undergoes a first-order reaction to form gaseous butadiene. At a particular temperature, the partial pressure of cyclobutene in the reaction vessel drops to one-eighth its original value in 124 seconds. What is the half-life for this reaction at this temperature?",
