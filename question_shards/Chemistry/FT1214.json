    "question": "To determine the percentage of water in a hydrated salt, a student heated a 1.2346 g sample of the salt for 30 minutes; when cooled to room temperature, the sample weighed 1.1857 g. After the sample was heated for an additional 10 minutes and again cooled to room temperature, the sample weighed 1.1632 g. Which of the following should the student do next?",
