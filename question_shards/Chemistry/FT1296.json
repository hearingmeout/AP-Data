    "question": "A 10. g cube of copper at a temperature T1 is placed in an insulated cup containing 10. g of water at a temperature T2 . If T1 > T2, which of the following is true of the system when it has attained thermal equilibrium? (The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/(g·°C) and the specific heat of water is 4.18 J/(g·°C).)",
