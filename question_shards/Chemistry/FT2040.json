    "question": "Which of the following graphs correctly shows the relationship between potential energy and internuclear separation for two hydrogen atoms?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "A graph plots Potential energy against Internuclear separation. The graph plots a concave down curve that rises and extends horizontally along a horizontal line depicting Potential energy 0.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A graph plots Potential energy against Internuclear separation. The graph plots a concave up curve that falls and extends horizontally along a horizontal line depicting Potential energy 0.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A graph plots Potential energy against Internuclear separation. A dashed horizontal line depicts Potential energy 0. The graph plots a curve that falls to a minimum through the line before rising with decreasing steepness and extending along the horizontal line.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A graph plots Potential energy against Internuclear separation. A dashed horizontal line depicts Potential energy 0. The graph plots a curve that falls to a minimum through the line, the curve then rise above the line a bit before falling along the horizontal line.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "A graph plots Potential energy against Internuclear separation. A dashed horizontal line depicts Potential energy 0. The graph plots a curve that falls to a minimum through the line before rising with decreasing steepness and extending along the horizontal line."
