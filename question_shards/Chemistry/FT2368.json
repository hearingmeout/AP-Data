        "label": "Solid iodine is a network covalent solid, whereas solid bromine is a molecular solid.",

        "label": "The covalent bonds in I2 molecules are weaker than those in Br2 molecules.",

      {
        "label": "I2 molecules have electron clouds that are more polarizable than those of Br2 molecules, thus London dispersion forces are stronger in liquid I2.",

        "label": "Bromine has a greater electronegativity than iodine, thus there are stronger dipole-dipole forces in liquid bromine than in liquid iodine.",
