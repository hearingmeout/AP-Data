    "question": "The dissolution of an ionic solute in a polar solvent can be imagined as occurring in three steps, as shown in the figure above. In step 1, the separation between ions in the solute is greatly increased, just as will occur when the solute dissolves in the polar solvent. In step 2, the polar solvent is expanded to make spaces that the ions will occupy. In the last step, the ions are inserted into the spaces in the polar solvent. Which of the following best describes the enthalpy change, ΔH, for each step?",
