    "question": "The experimental apparatus represented above is used to demonstrate the rates at which gases diffuse. When the cotton balls are placed in the ends of a tube at the same time, the gases diffuse from each end and meet somewhere in between, where they react to form a white solid. Which of the following combinations will produce a solid closest to the center of the tube?",
