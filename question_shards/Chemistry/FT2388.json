    "question": "CO(g) + 2 H2(g) ⇄ CH3OH(g)       ΔH < 0\n\nThe synthesis of CH3OH(g) from CO(g) and H2(g) is represented by the equation above. The value of Kc for the reaction at 483 K is 14.5.\n\nWhich of the following explains the effect on the equilibrium constant, Kc , when the temperature of the reaction system is increased to 650 K?",
