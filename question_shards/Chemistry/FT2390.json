    "question": "CO(g) + 2 H2(g) ⇄ CH3OH(g)       ΔH < 0\n\nThe synthesis of CH3OH(g) from CO(g) and H2(g) is represented by the equation above. The value of Kc for the reaction at 483 K is 14.5.\n\nA 1.0 mol sample of CO(g) and a 1.0 mol sample of H2(g) are pumped into a rigid, previously evacuated 2.0 L reaction vessel at 483 K. Which of the following is true at equilibrium?",
