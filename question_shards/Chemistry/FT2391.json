    "question": "The synthesis of CH3OH(g) from CO(g) and H2(g) is represented by the equation above. The value of Kc for the reaction at 483 K is 14.5. A mixture of CO(g) and H2(g) is pumped into a previously evacuated 2.0 L reaction vessel. The total pressure of the reaction system is 1.2 atm at equilibrium. What will be the total equilibrium pressure of the system if the volume of the reaction vessel is reduced to 1.0 L at constant temperature?",
