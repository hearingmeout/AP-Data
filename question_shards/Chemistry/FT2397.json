    "question": "COCl2(g)  ⇄  CO(g) + Cl2(g)\n\nCOCl2(g) decomposes according to the equation above. When pure COCl2(g) is injected into a rigid, previously evacuated flask at 690 K, the pressure in the flask is initially 1.0 atm. After the reaction reaches equilibrium at 690 K, the total pressure in the flask is 1.2 atm. What is the value of Kp for the reaction at 690 K?",
