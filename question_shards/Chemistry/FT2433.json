    "question": "In a titration experiment, H2O2(aq) reacts with aqueous MnO4-(aq) as represented by the equation above. The dark purple KMnO4 solution is added from a buret to a colorless, acidified solution of H2O2(aq) in an Erlenmeyer flask. (Note: At the end point of the titration, the solution is a pale pink color.) At a certain time during the titration, the rate of appearance of O2(g) was 1.0 x 10-3 mol/(L⋅s). What was the rate of disappearance of MnO4- at the same time?",
