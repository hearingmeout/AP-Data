    "question": "5 H2O2(aq) + 2 MnO4-(aq) + 6 H+(aq) → 2 Mn2+(aq) + 8 H2O(l) + 5 O2(g)\n\nIn a titration experiment, H2O2(aq) reacts with aqueous MnO4-(aq) as represented by the equation above. The dark purple KMnO4 solution is added from a buret to a colorless, acidified solution of H2O2(aq) in an Erlenmeyer flask. (Note: At the end point of the titration, the solution is a pale pink color.)\n\nWhich element is being oxidized during the titration, and what is the element’s change in oxidation number?",
