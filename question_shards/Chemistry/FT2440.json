    "question": "In a titration experiment, H2O2(aq) reacts with aqueous MnO4-(aq) as represented by the equation above. The dark purple KMnO4 solution is added from a buret to a colorless, acidified solution of H2O2(aq) in an Erlenmeyer flask. (Note: At the end point of the titration, the solution is a pale pink color.) Which of the following best describes what happens to the pH of the H2O2 solution as the titration proceeds?",
