    "question": "Consider the reaction represented by the equation 2 X + 2 Z → X2Z2. During a reaction in which a large excess of reactant X was present, the concentration of reactant Z was monitored over time. A plot of the natural logarithm of the concentration of Z versus time is shown in the figure above. The order of the reaction with respect to reactant Z is",
