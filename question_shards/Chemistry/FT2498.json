    "question": "rate = k[NO][NO3]The reaction represented above occurs in a single step that involves the collision between a particle of NO and a particle of NO3. A scientist correctly calculates the rate of collisions between NO and NO3 that have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy. The observed reaction rate is only a small fraction of the calculated collision rate. Which of the following best explains the discrepancy?",
