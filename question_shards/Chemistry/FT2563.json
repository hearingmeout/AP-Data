(i) Draw the complete Lewis electron-dot structure for each species. (ii) Account for the fact that the carbon-oxygen bond length in CO32- is greater than the carbon-oxygen bond length in CO2. (b) Consider the molecules CF4, and SF4 . (i) Draw the complete Lewis electron-dot structure for each molecule. (ii) In terms of molecular geometry, account for the fact that the CF4 molecule is nonpolar, whereas the SF4 molecule is polar.",
