    "question": "C(s) + CO2(g) ⇄ 2 CO(g)\n\nSolid carbon and carbon dioxide gas at 1,160 K were placed in a rigid 2.00 L container, and the reaction represented above occurred. As the reaction proceeded, the total pressure in the container was monitored. When equilibrium was reached, there was still some C(s) remaining in the container. Results are recorded in the table below.\n\n(a) Write the expression for the equilibrium constant, Kp , for the reaction.\n\n(b) Calculate the number of moles of CO2(g) initially placed in the container. (Assume that the volume of the solid carbon is negligible.)\n\n(c) For the reaction mixture at equilibrium at 1,160 K, the partial pressure of the CO2(g) is 1.63 atm. Calculate\n\n(i) the partial pressure of CO(g) , and\n\n(ii) the value of the equilibrium constant, Kp .\n\n(d) If a suitable solid catalyst were placed in the reaction vessel, would the final total pressure of the gases at equilibrium be greater than, less than, or equal to the final total pressure of the gases at equilibrium without the catalyst? Justify your answer. (Assume that the volume of the solid catalyst is negligible.)\n\nIn another experiment involving the same reaction, a rigid 2.00 L container initially contains 10.0 g of C(s), plus CO(g) and CO2(g), each at a partial pressure of 2.00 atm at 1,160 K.\n\n(e) Predict whether the partial pressure of CO2(g) will increase, decrease, or remain the same as this system approaches equilibrium. Justify your prediction with a calculation.",
