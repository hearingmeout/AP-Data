    "question": "Answer the following questions relating to gravimetric analysis.\n\nIn the first of two experiments, a student is assigned the task of determining the number of moles of water in one mole of MgCl2 ⋅ n H2O. The student collects the data shown in the following table.\n\n(a) Explain why the student can correctly conclude that the hydrate was heated a sufficient number of times in the experiment.\n\n(b) Use the data above to\n\n(i) calculate the total number of moles of water lost when the sample was heated, and\n\n(ii) determine the formula of the hydrated compound.\n\n(c) A different student heats the hydrate in an uncovered crucible, and some of the solid spatters out of the crucible. This spattering will have what effect on the calculated mass of the water lost by the hydrate? Justify your answer.\n\nIn the second experiment, a student is given 2.94 g of a mixture containing anhydrous MgCl2 and KNO3 . To determine the percentage by mass of MgCl2 in the mixture, the student uses excess AgNO3(aq) to precipitate the chloride ion as AgCl(s).\n\n(d) Starting with the 2.94 g sample of the mixture dissolved in water, briefly describe the steps necessary to quantitatively determine the mass of the AgCl precipitate.\n\n(e) The student determines the mass of the AgCl precipitate to be 5.48 g. On the basis of this information, calculate each of the following.\n\n(i) The number of moles of MgCl2 in the original mixture\n\n(ii) The percent by mass of MgCl2 in the original mixture",
