    "question": "A kinetics experiment is set up to collect the gas that is generated when a sample of chalk, consisting primarily of solid CaCO3, is added to a solution of ethanoic acid, CH3COOH. The rate of reaction between CaCO3 and CH3COOH is determined by measuring the volume of gas generated at 22oC and 1 atm as a function of time. Which of the following experimental conditions is most likely to increase the rate of gas production?",
