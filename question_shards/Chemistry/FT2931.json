    "question": "A 100g sample of a metal was heated to 100oC and then quickly transferred to an insulated container holding 100g of water at 22oC. The temperature of the water rose to reach a final temperature of 35oC. Which of the following can be concluded?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The metal temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the metal lost more thermal energy than the water gained.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The metal temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the metal lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The metal temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the metal must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the metal and the water; therefore the total energy of the metal and water decreased.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The metal temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the metal lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained."
