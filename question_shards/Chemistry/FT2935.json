    "question": "To make Au stronger and harder, it is often alloyed with other metals, such as Cu and Ag. Consider two alloys, one of Au and Cu and one of Au and Ag, each with the same mole fraction of Au. If the Au/Cu alloy is harder than the Au/Ag alloy, then which of the following is the best explanation based on the information in the table above?",

      {
        "label": "Cu atoms are smaller than Ag atoms, thus they interfere more with the displacement of atoms in the alloy.",

        "label": "Cu atoms are less polarizable than are Au or Ag atoms, thus Cu has weaker interparticle forces.",
