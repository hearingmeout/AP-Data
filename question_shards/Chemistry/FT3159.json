    "question": "A 25 mL sample of a 1.0 M solution of acid 1 is mixed with 25 mL of 0.50 M NaOH. Which of the following best explains what happens to the pH of the mixture when a few drops of 1.0 M HNO3 are added?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The pH of the mixture increases sharply, because HNO3 is a strong acid.",

      {
        "label": "The pH of the mixture decreases sharply, because H3O+ ions were added.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pH of the mixture stays about the same, because the conjugate base of acid 1 reacts with the added H3O+ ions.",
