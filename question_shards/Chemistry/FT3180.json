    "description": "Refer to the following.\n\nA 50.0 mL sample of an acid, HA, of unknown molarity is titrated, and the pH of the resulting solution is measured with a meter and graphed as a function of the volume of 0.100 M NaOH added.",
    "question": "Which of the following is the best particulate representation of the species (other than H2O) that are present in significant concentrations in the solution at point U in the titration?",
