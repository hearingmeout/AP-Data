    "description": "Refer to the following.\n\nPCl5(g) ⇄ PCl3(g)+Cl2(g)\n\nPCl5(g) decomposes into PCl3(g) and Cl2(g) according to the equation above. A pure sample of PCl5(g) is placed in a rigid, evacuated 1.00L container. The initial pressure of the PCl5(g) is 1.00 atm. The temperature is held constant until the PCl5(g) reaches equilibrium with its decomposition products. The figures below show the initial and equilibrium conditions of the system.",
