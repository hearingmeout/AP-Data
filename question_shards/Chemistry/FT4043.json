    "description": "The following questions refer to the below.\n\nM+ is an unknown metal cation with a +1 charge. A student dissolves the chloride of the unknown metal, MCl, in enough water to make 100.0 mL of solution. The student then mixes the solution with excess AgNO3 solution, causing AgCl to precipitate. The student collects the precipitate by filtration, dries it, and records the data shown below. (The molar mass of AgCl is 143 g/mol.)\n\nMass of unknown chloride, MCl\n 0.74 g\n\nMass of filter paper\n 0.80 g\n\nMass of filter paper plus AgCl precipitate\n 2.23 g",
