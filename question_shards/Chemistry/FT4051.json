    "question": "A student prepared five solutions of CuSO4 with different concentrations, and then filled five cuvettes, each containing one of the solutions. The cuvettes were placed in a spectrophotometer set to the appropriate wavelength for maximum absorbance. The absorbance of each solution was measured and recorded. The student plotted absorbance versus concentration, as shown in the figure above. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the variance of the data point for the 0.600 M CuSO4 solution?",
