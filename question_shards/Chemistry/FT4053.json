    "question": "A sample containing atoms of C and F was analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The portion of the spectrum showing the 1s peaks for atoms of the two elements is shown above. Which of the following correctly identifies the 1s peak for the F atoms and provides an appropriate explanation?",
