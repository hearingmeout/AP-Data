    "question": "The percentage of silver in a solid sample is determined gravimetrically by converting the silver to Ag+(aq) and precipitating it as silver chloride. Failure to do which of the following could cause errors in the analysis?\n\nAccount for the mass of the weighing paper when determining the mass of the sample\n\nMeasure the temperature during the precipitation reaction\n\nWash the precipitate\n\nHeat the AgCl precipitate to constant mass",
