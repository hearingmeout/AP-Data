    "question": "Answer the following questions that relate to the analysis of chemical compounds.\n\nA compound containing the elements C , H , N , and O is analyzed. When a 1.2359 g sample is burned in excess oxygen, 2.241 g of CO2(g) is formed. The combustion analysis also showed that the sample contained 0.0648 g of H.\n\nDetermine the mass, in grams, of C in the 1.2359 g sample of the compound.\n\nWhen the compound is analyzed for N content only, the mass percent of N is found to be 28.84 percent. Determine the mass, in grams, of N in the original 1.2359 g sample of the compound.\n\nDetermine the mass, in grams, of O in the original 1.2359 g sample of the compound.\n\nDetermine the empirical formula of the compound.\n\nA different compound, which has the empirical formula CH2Br , has a vapor density of 6.00 g L−1 at 375 K and 0.983 atm. Using these data, determine the following.\n\nThe molar mass of the compound\n\nThe molecular formula of the compound",
