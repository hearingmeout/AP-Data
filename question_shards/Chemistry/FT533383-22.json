    "question": "Answer each of the following in terms of principles of molecular behavior and chemical concepts.\n\nThe structures for glucose, C6H12O6 , and cyclohexane, C6H12 , are shown below.\n\nIdentify the type(s) of intermolecular attractive forces in\n\npure glucose\n\npure cyclohexane\n\nGlucose is soluble in water but cyclohexane is not soluble in water. Explain.\n\nConsider the two processes represented below.\n\nProcess 1: H2O(l) → H2O(g) ∆H° = +44.0 kJ mol−1\n\nProcess 2: H2O(l) → H2(g) + ½ O2(g) ∆H° = +286 kJ mol−1\n\nFor each of the two processes, identify the type(s) of intermolecular or intramolecular attractive forces that must be overcome for the process to occur.\n\nIndicate whether you agree or disagree with the statement in the box below. Support your answer with a short explanation.\n\nWhen water boils, H2O molecules break apart to form hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules.\n\nConsider the four reaction-energy profile diagrams shown below.\n\nIdentify the two diagrams that could represent a catalyzed and an uncatalyzed reaction pathway for the same reaction. Indicate which of the two diagrams represents the catalyzed reaction pathway for the reaction.\n\nIndicate whether you agree or disagree with the statement in the box below. Support your answer with a short explanation.\n\nAdding a catalyst to a reaction mixture adds energy that causes the reaction to proceed more quickly.",
