    "question": "Answer each of the following in terms of principles of molecular behavior and chemical concepts. The structures for glucose, C6H12O6 , and cyclohexane, C6H12 , are shown below. Identify the type(s) of intermolecular attractive forces in pure glucose pure cyclohexane Glucose is soluble in water but cyclohexane is not soluble in water. Explain. Consider the two processes represented below. Process 1: H2O(l) → H2O(g) ∆H° = +44.0 kJ mol−1 Process 2: H2O(l) → H2(g) + ½ O2(g) ∆H° = +286 kJ mol−1 For each of the two processes, identify the type(s) of intermolecular or intramolecular attractive forces that must be overcome for the process to occur. Indicate whether you agree or disagree with the statement in the box below. Support your answer with a short explanation. When water boils, H2O molecules break apart to form hydrogen molecules and oxygen molecules. Consider the four reaction-energy profile diagrams shown below. Identify the two diagrams that could represent a catalyzed and an uncatalyzed reaction pathway for the same reaction. Indicate which of the two diagrams represents the catalyzed reaction pathway for the reaction. Indicate whether you agree or disagree with the statement in the box below. Support your answer with a short explanation. Adding a catalyst to a reaction mixture adds energy that causes the reaction to proceed more quickly.",
