    "question": "C6H5COOH(s) ⇄ C6H5COO–(aq) + H+(aq) Ka = 6.46 x 10–5\nBenzoic acid, C6H5COOH, dissociates in water as shown in the equation above. A 25.0 mL sample of an aqueous solution of pure benzoic acid is titrated using standardized 0.150 M NaOH.\n\nAfter addition of 15.0 mL of the 0.150 M NaOH, the pH of the resulting solution is 4.37. Calculate each of the following.\n\n[H+] in the solution\n\n[OH–] in the solution\n\nThe number of moles of NaOH added\n\nThe number of moles of C6H5COO– (aq) in the solution\n\nThe number of moles of C6H5COOH in the solution\n\nState whether the solution at the equivalence point of the titration is acidic, basic, or neutral. Explain your reasoning.\nIn a different titration, a 0.7529 g sample of a mixture of solid C6H5COOH and solid NaCl is dissolved in water and titrated with 0.150 M NaOH. The equivalence point is reached when 24.78 mL of the base solution is added.\n\nCalculate each of the following.\n\nThe mass, in grams, of benzoic acid in the solid sample\n\nThe mass percentage of benzoic acid in the solid sample",
