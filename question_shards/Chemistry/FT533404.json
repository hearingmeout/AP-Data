    "question": "Answer the following questions about the thermodynamics of the reactions represented below. Reaction X: ½ I2(s) + ½ Cl2(g) ⇄ ICl(g) ∆H°f = 18 kJ mol–1, ∆S°298 = 78 J K–1 mol–1 Reaction Y: ½ I2(s) + ½ Br2(l) ⇄ IBr(g) ∆H°f = 41 kJ mol–1, ∆S°298 = 124 J K–1 mol–1 Is reaction X , represented above, spontaneous under standard conditions? Justify your answer with a calculation. Calculate the value of the equilibrium constant, Keq , for reaction X at 25℃. What effect will an increase in temperature have on the equilibrium constant for reaction X ? Explain your answer. Explain why the standard entropy change is greater for reaction Y than for reaction X. Above what temperature will the value of the equilibrium constant for reaction Y be greater than 1.0 ? Justify your answer with calculations. For the vaporization of solid iodine, I2(s) → I2(g) , the value of ∆H°298 is 62 kJ mol–1. Using this information, calculate the value of ∆H°298 for the reaction represented below. I2(g) + Cl2(g) ⇄ 2 ICl(g)",
