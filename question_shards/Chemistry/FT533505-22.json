For propanone, draw the complete structural formula (showing all atoms and bonds); predict the approximate carbon-to-carbon-to-carbon bond angle. For each pair of compounds below, explain why they do not have the same value for their standard heat of vaporization, ΔH°vap, (You must include specific information about both compounds in each pair.) Propane and propanone Propanone and 1-propanol Draw the complete structural formula for an isomer of the molecule you drew in part (a) (i). Given the structural formula for propyne below, indicate the hybridization of the carbon atom indicated by the arrow in the structure above; indicate the total number of sigma (σ) bonds and the total number of pi (𝝿) bonds in the molecule.",
