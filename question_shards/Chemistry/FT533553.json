    "question": "Use principles of thermodynamics to answer the following questions.\n\nThe gas N2O4 decomposes to form the gas NO2 according to the equation below.\n\nPredict the sign of ΔH° for the reaction. Justify your answer.\n\nPredict the sign of ΔS° for the reaction. Justify your answer.\n\nOne of the diagrams below best represents the relationship between ΔG° and temperature for the reaction given in part (a). Assume that ΔH° and ΔS° are independent of temperature.\n\nDraw a circle around the correct graph. Explain why you chose that graph in terms of the relationship ΔG° = ΔH° – TΔS°.\n\nA reaction mixture of N2O4 and NO2 is at equilibrium. Heat is added to the mixture while the mixture is maintained at constant pressure.\n\nExplain why the concentration of N2O4 decreases.\n\nThe value of Keq at 25°C is 5.0 × 10−3 . Will the value of Keq at 100°C be greater than, less than, or equal to this value?\n\nUsing the value of Keq at 25°C given in part (c)(ii), predict whether the value of ΔH° is expected to be greater than, less than, or equal to the value of TΔS°. Explain.",
