    "question": "Use principles of thermodynamics to answer the following questions. The gas N2O4 decomposes to form the gas NO2 according to the equation below. Predict the sign of ΔH° for the reaction. Justify your answer. Predict the sign of ΔS° for the reaction. Justify your answer. One of the diagrams below best represents the relationship between ΔG° and temperature for the reaction given in part (a). Assume that ΔH° and ΔS° are independent of temperature. Draw a circle around the correct graph. Explain why you chose that graph in terms of the relationship ΔG° = ΔH° – TΔS°. A reaction mixture of N2O4 and NO2 is at equilibrium. Heat is added to the mixture while the mixture is maintained at constant pressure. Explain why the concentration of N2O4 decreases. The value of Keq at 25°C is 5.0 × 10−3 . Will the value of Keq at 100°C be greater than, less than, or equal to this value? Using the value of Keq at 25°C given in part (c)(ii), predict whether the value of ΔH° is expected to be greater than, less than, or equal to the value of TΔS°. Explain.",
