    "question": "Answer the following questions that relate to the chemistry of halogen oxoacids. Use the information in the table below to answer part (a)(i). Which of the two acids is stronger, HOCl or HOBr ? Justify your answer in terms of Ka . Draw a complete Lewis electron-dot diagram for the acid that you identified in part (a)(i). Hypoiodous acid has the formula HOI. Predict whether HOI is a stronger acid or a weaker acid than the acid that you identified in part (a)(i). Justify your prediction in terms of chemical bonding. Write the equation for the reaction that occurs between hypochlorous acid and water. A 1.2 M NaOCl solution is prepared by dissolving solid NaOCl in distilled water at 298 K. The hydrolysis reaction OCl−(aq) + H2O(l) ⇄ HOCl(aq) + OH−(aq) occurs. Write the equilibrium-constant expression for the hydrolysis reaction that occurs between OCl-(aq) and H2O(l) . Calculate the value of the equilibrium constant at 298 K for the hydrolysis reaction. Calculate the value of [OH-] in the 1.2 M NaOCl solution at 298 K . A buffer solution is prepared by dissolving some solid NaOCl in a solution of HOCl at 298 K. The pH of the buffer solution is determined to be 6.48. Calculate the value of [H3O+] in the buffer solution. Indicate which of HOCl(aq) or OCl−(aq) is present at the higher concentration in the buffer solution. Support your answer with a calculation.",
