    "question": "Answer the following questions related to sulfur and one of its compounds.\n\nConsider the two chemical species S and S2- .\n\nWrite the electron configuration (e.g., 1s2 2s2 . . .) of each species.\n\nExplain why the radius of the S2− ion is larger than the radius of the S atom.\n\nWhich of the two species would be attracted into a magnetic field? Explain.\n\nThe S2- ion is isoelectronic with the Ar atom. From which species, S2- or Ar, is it easier to remove an electron? Explain.\n\nIn the H2S molecule, the H–S–H bond angle is close to 90°. On the basis of this information, which atomic orbitals of the S atom are involved in bonding with the H atoms?\n\nTwo types of intermolecular forces present in liquid H2S are London (dispersion) forces and dipole-dipole forces.\n\nCompare the strength of the London (dispersion) forces in liquid H2S to the strength of the London (dispersion) forces in liquid H2O. Explain.\n\nCompare the strength of the dipole-dipole forces in liquid H2S to the strength of the dipole-dipole forces in liquid H2O. Explain.",
