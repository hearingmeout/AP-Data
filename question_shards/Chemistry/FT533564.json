    "question": "Answer the following questions about nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia. In the boxes below, draw the complete Lewis electron-dot diagrams for N2 and NH3 . Calculate the standard free-energy change, ΔG°, that occurs when 12.0 g of H2(g) reacts with excess N2(g) at 298 K according to the reaction represented below. N2(g) + 3 H2(g) ⇄ 2 NH3(g) 298 ΔG°298 = –34 kJ mol-1 Given that ΔH°298 for the reaction is −92.2 kJ mol-1, which is larger, the total bond dissociation energy of the reactants or the total bond dissociation energy of the products? Explain. The value of the standard entropy change, ΔS°298 , for the reaction is −199 J mol-1K-1. Explain why the value of ΔS°298 is negative. Assume that ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction are independent of temperature. Explain why there is a temperature above 298 K at which the algebraic sign of the value of ΔG° changes. Theoretically, the best yields of ammonia should be achieved at low temperatures and high pressures.",
