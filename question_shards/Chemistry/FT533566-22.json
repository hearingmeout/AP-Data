    "question": "Several reactions are carried out using AgBr, a cream-colored silver salt for which the value of the solubility-product constant, Ksp , is 5.0 x 10−13 at 298 K.\n\nWrite the expression for the solubility-product constant, Ksp , of AgBr.\n\nCalculate the value of [Ag+] in 50.0 mL of a saturated solution of AgBr at 298 K.\n\nA 50.0 mL sample of distilled water is added to the solution described in part (b), which is in a beaker with some solid AgBr at the bottom. The solution is stirred and equilibrium is reestablished. Some solid AgBr remains in the beaker. Is the value of [Ag+] greater than, less than, or equal to the value you calculated in part (b) ? Justify your answer.\n\nCalculate the minimum volume of distilled water, in liters, necessary to completely dissolve a 5.0 g sample of AgBr(s) at 298 K. (The molar mass of AgBr is 188 g mol-1.)\n\nA student mixes 10.0 mL of 1.5 x 10−4 M AgNO3 with 2.0 mL of 5.0 x 10−4 M NaBr and stirs the resulting mixture. What will the student observe? Justify your answer with calculations.\n\nThe color of another salt of silver, AgI(s), is yellow. A student adds a solution of NaI to a test tube containing a small amount of solid, cream-colored AgBr. After stirring the contents of the test tube, the student observes that the solid in the test tube changes color from cream to yellow.\n\nWrite the chemical equation for the reaction that occurred in the test tube.\n\nWhich salt has the greater value of Ksp : AgBr or AgI ? Justify your answer.",
