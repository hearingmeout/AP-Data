    "question": "Use the information in the table below to respond to the statements and questions that follow. Your answers should be in terms of principles of molecular structure and intermolecular forces.\n\nDraw the complete Lewis electron-dot diagram for ethyne in the appropriate cell in the table above.\n\nWhich of the four molecules contains the shortest carbon-to-carbon bond? Explain.\n\nA Lewis electron-dot diagram of a molecule of ethanoic acid is given below. The carbon atoms in the molecule are labeled x and y, respectively.\n\nIdentify the geometry of the arrangement of atoms bonded to each of the following.\n\nCarbon x\n\nCarbon y\n\nEnergy is required to boil ethanol. Consider the statement “As ethanol boils, energy goes into breaking C−C bonds, C−H bonds, C−O bonds, and O−H bonds.” Is the statement true or false? Justify your answer.\n\nIdentify a compound from the table above that is nonpolar. Justify your answer.\n\nEthanol is completely soluble in water, whereas ethanethiol has limited solubility in water. Account for the difference in solubilities between the two compounds in terms of intermolecular forces.",
