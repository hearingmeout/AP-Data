    "question": "A solution of 0.100 M HCl and a solution of 0.100 M NaOH are prepared. A 40.0 mL sample of one of the solutions is added to a beaker and then titrated with the other solution. A pH electrode is used to obtain the data that are plotted in the titration curve shown above. Identify the solution that was initially added to the beaker. Explain your reasoning. On the titration curve above, circle the point that corresponds to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, how many moles of titrant have been added? The same titration is to be performed again, this time using an indicator. Use the information in the table below to select the best indicator for the titration. Explain your choice. What is the difference between the equivalence point of a titration and the end point of a titration? On the grid provided on the next page, sketch the titration curve that would result if the solutions in the beaker and buret were reversed (i.e., if 40.0 mL of the solution used in the buret in the previous titration were titrated with the solution that was in the beaker).",
