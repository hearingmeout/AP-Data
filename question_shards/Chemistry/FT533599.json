    "question": "CaCO3(s) ⇄ CaO(s)+ CO2(g)\n\nWhen heated, calcium carbonate decomposes according to the equation above. In a study of the decomposition of calcium carbonate, a student added a 50.0 g sample of powdered CaCO3(s) to a 1.00 L rigid container. The student sealed the container, pumped out all the gases, then heated the container in an oven at 1100 K. As the container was heated, the total pressure of the CO2(g) in the container was measured over time. The data are plotted in the graph below.\n\nThe student repeated the experiment, but this time the student used a 100.0 g sample of powdered CaCO3(s). In this experiment, the final pressure in the container was 1.04 atm, which was the same final pressure as in the first experiment.\n\nCalculate the number of moles of CO2(g) present in the container after 20 minutes of heating.\n\nThe student claimed that the final pressure in the container in each experiment became constant because all of the CaCO3(s) had decomposed. Based on the data in the experiments, do you agree with this claim? Explain.\n\nAfter 20 minutes some CO2(g) was injected into the container, initially raising the pressure to 1.5 atm. Would the final pressure inside the container be less than, greater than, or equal to 1.04 atm? Explain your reasoning.\n\nAre there sufficient data obtained in the experiments to determine the value of the equilibrium constant, Kp ,for the decomposition of CaCO3(s) at 1100 K? Justify your answer.",
