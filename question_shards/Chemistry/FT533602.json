    "question": "The half-life (t1/2) of the catalyzed isomerization of cis-2-butene gas to produce trans-2-butene gas, represented above, was measured under various conditions, as shown in the table below.\n\nThe reaction is first order. Explain how the data in the table are consistent with a first-order reaction.\n\nCalculate the rate constant, k, for the reaction at 350. K. Include appropriate units with your answer.\n\nIs the initial rate of the reaction in trial 1 greater than, less than, or equal to the initial rate in trial 2 ? Justify your answer.\n\nThe half-life of the reaction in trial 4 is less than the half-life in trial 1. Explain why, in terms of activation energy.",
