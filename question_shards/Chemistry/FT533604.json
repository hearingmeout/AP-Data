    "question": "Ethene, C2H4(g) (molar mass 28.1 g/mol), may be prepared by the dehydration of ethanol, C2H5OH(g) (molar mass 46.1 g/mol), using a solid catalyst. A setup for the lab synthesis is shown in the diagram above. The equation for the dehydration reaction is given below. A student added a 0.200 g sample of C2H5OH(l) to a test tube using the setup shown above. The student heated the test tube gently with a Bunsen burner until all of the C2H5OH(l) evaporated and gas generation stopped. When the reaction stopped, the volume of collected gas was 0.0854 L at 0.822 atm and 305 K. (The vapor pressure of water at 305 K is 35.7 torr.) Calculate the number of moles of C2H4(g) that are actually produced in the experiment and measured in the gas collection tube and that would be produced if the dehydration reaction went to completion. Calculate the percent yield of C2H4(g) in the experiment. Because the dehydration reaction is not observed to occur at 298 K, the student claims that the reaction has an equilibrium constant less than 1.00 at 298 K. Do the thermodynamic data for the reaction support the student’s claim? Justify your answer, including a calculation of ΔG°298 for the reaction. The Lewis electron-dot diagram for C2H4 is shown below in the box on the left. In the box on the right, complete the Lewis electron-dot diagram for C2H5OH by drawing in all of the electron pairs. What is the approximate value of the C–O–H bond angle in the ethanol molecule? During the dehydration experiment, C2H4(g) and unreacted C2H5OH(g) passed through the tube into the water. The C2H4 was quantitatively collected as a gas, but the unreacted C2H5OH was not. Explain this observation in terms of the intermolecular forces between water and each of the two gases.",
