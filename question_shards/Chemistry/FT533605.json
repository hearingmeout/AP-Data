    "question": "Potassium sorbate, KC6H7O2 (molar mass 150. g/mol) is commonly added to diet soft drinks as a preservative. A stock solution of KC6H7O2(aq) of known concentration must be prepared. A student titrates 45.00 mL of the stock solution with 1.25 M HCl(aq) using both an indicator and a pH meter. The value of Ka for sorbic acid,\n\nKC6H7O2, is 1.7 x 10−5.\n\nWrite the net-ionic equation for the reaction between KC6H7O2(aq) and HCl(aq).\n\nA total of 29.95 mL of 1.25 M HCl(aq) is required to reach the equivalence point. Calculate [KC6H7O2] in the stock solution.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point of the titration is measured to be 2.54 Which of the following indicators would be the best choice for determining the end point of the titration? Justify your answer.\n\nCalculate the pH at the half-equivalence point.\n\nThe initial pH and the equivalence point are plotted on the graph below. Accurately sketch the titration curve on the graph below. Mark the position of the half-equivalence point on the curve with an X.\n\nThe pH of the soft drink is 3.37 after the addition of the KC6H7O2(aq). Which species, HC6H7O2 or C6H7O2− , has a higher concentration in the soft drink? Justify your answer.",
