    "question": "A student learns that ionic compounds have significant covalent character when a cation has a polarizing effect on a large anion. As a result, the student hypothesizes that salts composed of small cations and large anions should have relatively low melting points.\n\nSelect two compounds from the table and explain how the data support the student’s hypothesis.\n\nIdentify a compound from the table that can be dissolved in water to produce a basic solution. Write the net ionic equation for the reaction that occurs to cause the solution to be basic.",
