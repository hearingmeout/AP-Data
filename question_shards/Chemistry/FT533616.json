    "question": "The diagram below shows the experimental setup for a typical electrochemical cell that contains two standard half-cells. The cell operates according to the reaction represented by the following equation. Zn (s) + Ni2+ (aq) → Ni (s) + Zn2+ (aq) Identify M and M2+ in the diagram and specify the initial concentration for M2+ in solution. Indicate which of the metal electrodes is the cathode. Write the balanced equation for the reaction that occurs in the half-cell containing the cathode. What would be the effect on the cell voltage if the concentration of Zn2+ was reduced to 0.100 M in the half-cell containing the Zn electrode? Describe what would happen to the cell voltage if the salt bridge was removed. Explain.",
