    "question": "The structures of a water molecule and a crystal of LiCl(s) are represented above. A student prepares a 1.0 M solution by dissolving 4.2 g of LiCl(s) in enough water to make 100 mL of solution. In the space provided below, show the interactions of the components of LiCl(aq) by making a drawing that represents the different particles present in the solution. Base the particles in your drawing on the particles shown in the representations above. Include only one formula unit of LiCl and no more than ten molecules of water. Your drawing must include the following details. • identity of ions (symbol and charge) • the arrangement and proper orientation of the particles in the solution The student passes a direct current through the solution and observes that chlorine gas is produced at the anode. Identify the chemical species produced at the cathode and justify your answer using the information given in the table below.",
