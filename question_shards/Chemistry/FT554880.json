It reacts with water as represented in the equation above. Consider the two beakers below. Each beaker has a layer of colorless oil (a nonpolar solvent) on top of a layer of aqueous buffer solution. In beaker X the pH of the buffer solution is 3, and in beaker Y the pH of the buffer solution is 7. A small amount of HIn is placed in both beakers. The mixtures are stirred well, and the oil and water layers are allowed to separate.\n\nWhat is the predominant form of HIn in the aqueous buffer in beaker Y, the acid form or the conjugate base form?
