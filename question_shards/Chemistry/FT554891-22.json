    "question": "A student is given the task of determining the I− content of tablets that contain KI and an inert, water-soluble sugar as a filler. A tablet is dissolved in 50.0 mL of distilled water, and an excess of 0.20 M Pb(NO3)2(aq) is added to the solution. A yellow precipitate forms, which is then filtered, washed, and dried. The data from the experiment are shown in the table above.\n\nFor the chemical reaction that occurs when the precipitate forms,\n\nwrite a balanced, net-ionic equation for the reaction, and\n\nexplain why the reaction is best represented by a net-ionic equation.\n\nExplain the purpose of drying and weighing the filter paper with the precipitate three times.\n\nIn the filtrate solution, is [K+] greater than, less than, or equal to [NO3−] ? Justify your answer.\n\nCalculate the number of moles of precipitate that is produced in the experiment.\n\nCalculate the mass percent of I− in the tablet.\n\nIn another trial, the student dissolves a tablet in 55.0 mL of water instead of 50.0 mL of water. Predict whether the experimentally determined mass percent of I− will be greater than, less than, or equal to the amount calculated in part (e). Justify your answer.\n\nA student in another lab also wants to determine the I− content of a KI tablet but does not have access to Pb(NO3)2 . However, the student does have access to 0.20 M AgNO3 , which reacts with I−(aq) to produce AgI(s). The value of Ksp for AgI is 8.5 x 10−17.\n\nWill the substitution of AgNO3 for Pb(NO3)2 result in the precipitation of the I− ion from solution? Justify your answer.\n\nThe student only has access to one KI tablet and a balance that can measure to the nearest 0.01 g. Will the student be able to determine the mass of AgI produced to three significant figures? Justify your answer.",
