    "question": "2H2S(g) + SO2(g) ⇌ 3S(s) + 2H2O(g) At 298 K, the standard enthalpy change, ∆Ho, for the reaction represented above is -145 kilojoules. (a) Predict the sign of the standard entropy change, ∆So, for the reaction. Explain the basis for your prediction. (b) At 298 K, the forward reaction (i.e., toward the right) is spontaneous. What change, if any, would occur in the value of ∆Go for this reaction as the temperature is increased? Explain your reasoning using thermodynamic principles. (c) What change, if any, would occur in the value of the equilibrium constant, Keq, for the situation described in (b)? Explain your reasoning. (d) The absolute temperature at which the forward reaction becomes nonspontaneous can be predicted. Write the equation that is used to make the prediction. Why does this equation predict only an approximate value for the temperature?",
