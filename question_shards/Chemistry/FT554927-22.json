    "question": "Mg(s) + 2 H+(aq) → Mg2+(aq) + H2(g)\n\nA student performs an experiment to determine the volume of hydrogen gas produced when a given mass of magnesium reacts with excess HCl(aq) , as represented by the net ionic equation above. The student begins with a 0.0360 g sample of pure magnesium and a solution of 2.0 M HCl(aq).\n\nCalculate the number of moles of magnesium in the 0.0360 g sample.\n\nCalculate the number of moles of HCl(aq) needed to react completely with the sample of magnesium.\n\nAs the magnesium reacts, the hydrogen gas produced is collected by water displacement at 23.0°C. The pressure of the gas in the collection tube is measured to be 749 torr.\n\nGiven that the equilibrium vapor pressure of water is 21 torr at 23.0°C, calculate the pressure that the H2(g) produced in the reaction would have if it were dry.\n\nCalculate the volume, in liters measured at the conditions in the laboratory, that the H2(g) produced in the reaction would have if it were dry.\n\nThe laboratory procedure specified that the concentration of the HCl solution be 2.0 M, but only 12.3 M HCl solution was available. Describe the steps for safely preparing 50.0 mL of 2.0 M HCl(aq) using 12.3 M HCl solution and materials selected from the list below. Show any necessary calculation(s).\n\n10.0 mL graduated cylinder\n Distilled water\n\n250 mL beakers\n Balance\n\n50.00 mL volumetric flask\n Dropper",
