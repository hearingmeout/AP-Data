    "question": "CaSO4 ⋅ 2 H2O(s) ⇄ CaSO4(s) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe hydrate CaSO4 ⋅ 2 H2O(s) can be heated to form the anhydrous salt, CaSO4(s), as shown by the reaction represented above.\n\nUsing the data in the table below, calculate the value of ΔG°, in kJ/molrxn , for the reaction at 298 K.\n\nGiven that the value of ΔH° for the reaction at 298 K is +105 kJ/molrxn , calculate the value of ΔS° for the reaction at 298 K. Include units with your answer.\n\nA sample of CaSO4 ⋅ 2 H2O(s) is placed in a cylinder with a movable piston as shown in the diagram below. The air above the solid is at 1.00 atm and is initially dry (partial pressure of H2O(g) = 0 atm).\n\nWrite the expression for the equilibrium constant, Kp, for the reaction.\n\nGiven that the equilibrium constant, Kp , is 6.4 x 10–4 at 298 K, determine the partial pressure, in atm, of water vapor in the cylinder at equilibrium at 298 K.\n\nIf the volume of the system is reduced to one-half of its original volume and the system is allowed to reestablish equilibrium at 298 K, what will be the pressure, in atm, of the water vapor at the new volume? Justify your answer.\n\nIn the laboratory, the hydrate CaSO4 ⋅ 2 H2O(s) can be heated in a crucible to completely drive off the water of hydration to form the anhydrous salt, CaSO4(s).\n\nA 2.49 g sample of pure CaSO4 ⋅ 2 H2O(s) is heated several times until the mass is constant. Calculate the mass, in grams, of the solid that remains after the dehydration reaction is complete.",
