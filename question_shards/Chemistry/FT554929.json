    "question": "2 H2O2(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + O2(g) The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form water and oxygen gas is represented by the equation above. A proposed mechanism for the reaction, which involves the free radicals HO⋅ and HOO⋅ , is represented by the three equations below. H2O2 → 2 HO⋅ (slow) H2O2 + HO⋅ → H2O + HOO⋅ (fast) HOO⋅ + HO⋅ → H2O + O2 (fast) Write the rate law consistent with the proposed mechanism above. The rate of the decomposition reaction was studied in an experiment, and the resulting data were plotted in the graph below. Using the graph, determine the time, in hours, needed for the concentration of H2O2 to change from 1.50 M to 0.75 M 0.80 M to 0.40 M The experimental data are consistent with the proposed mechanism. Explain. An electrochemical cell based on the decomposition of H2O2 can be constructed based on the half-reactions in the table below. Calculate the value of the standard cell potential, E°, for the cell. Indicate whether ΔG° for the decomposition reaction is greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to 0. Justify your answer. The decomposition of H2O2(aq) is slow at 298 K, but a suitable catalyst greatly increases the rate of the decomposition reaction. Draw a circle around each of the quantities below that has a different value for the catalyzed reaction than for the uncatalyzed reaction. Keq ΔG° ΔH° Ea For any quantity that you circled above, indicate whether its value is greater or less for the catalyzed reaction than for the uncatalyzed reaction. Explain why.",
