    "question": "Answer the following questions in terms of principles of chemical bonding and intermolecular forces. In each explanation where a comparison is to be made, a complete answer must include a discussion of both substances. The following complete Lewis electron-dot diagrams may be useful in answering parts of this question. At 1 atm and 298 K, pentane is a liquid whereas propane is a gas. Explain. At 1 atm and 298 K, methanol is a liquid whereas propane is a gas. Explain. Indicate the hybridization of the carbon atom in each of the following: Methanol Methanoic (formic) acid Draw the complete Lewis electron-dot diagram for a molecule of propanoic acid, HC3H5O2 . Explain the following observations about the two carbon-oxygen bonds in the methanoate (formate) anion, HCO2−. You may draw a Lewis electron-dot diagram (or diagrams) of the methanoate ion as part of your explanations. The two carbon-oxygen bonds in the methanoate (formate) anion, HCO2−, have the same length. The length of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the methanoate (formate) anion, HCO2−, is intermediate between the length of the carbon-oxygen bond in methanol and the length of the carbon-oxygen bond in methanal.",
