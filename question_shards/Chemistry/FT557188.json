A chemist proposes two different possible mechanisms for the reaction, which are given below. Mechanism 1 Mechanism 2 X2 → 2 X (slow) X2 → 2 X (slow) X + Y2 → XY2 (fast) X + Y2 → XY + Y (fast) X + XY2 → X2Y2 (fast) X + XY → X2Y (fast) X2Y + Y → X2Y2 (fast) Based on the information above, which of the following is true?",
