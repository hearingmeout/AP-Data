    "question": "Ba2+(aq) + EDTA4-(aq) ⇄ Ba(EDTA)2-(aq)        K = 7.7 × 107\n\nThe polyatomic ion C10H12N2O84- is commonly abbreviated as EDTA4-. The ion can form complexes with metal ions in aqueous solutions. A complex of EDTA4- with Ba2+ ion forms according to the equation above. A 50.0 mL volume of a solution that has an EDTA4-(aq) concentration of 0.30 M is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.20 M Ba(NO3)2 to produce 100.0 mL of solution.\n\nConsidering the value of K for the reaction, determine the concentration of Ba(EDTA)2-(aq) in the 100.0 mL of solution. Justify your answer.\n\nThe solution is diluted with distilled water to a total volume of 1.00 L. After equilibrium has been reestablished, is the number of moles of Ba2+(aq) present in the solution greater than, less than, or equal to the number of moles of Ba2+(aq) present in the original solution before it was diluted? Justify your answer.",
