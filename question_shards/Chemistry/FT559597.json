    "question": "Two samples of Mg(s) of equal mass were placed in equal amounts of HCI(aq) contained in two separate reaction vessels. Particle representations of the mixing of Mg(s) and HCI(aq) in the two reaction vessels are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 above. Water molecules are not included in the particle representations. Which of the reactions will initially proceed faster, and why?",
