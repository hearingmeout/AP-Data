    "description": "To determine the concentration of a NaOH(aq) solution, a student titrated a 50. mL sample with 0.10 M HCl(aq) . The reaction is represented by the equation above. The titration is monitored using a pH meter, and the experimental results are plotted in the graph below.",
    "question": "One student titrated the NaOH(aq) with 1.0 M HCl(aq) instead of 0.10 M HCl(aq). How would the student’s titration curve differ from the original curve?",
