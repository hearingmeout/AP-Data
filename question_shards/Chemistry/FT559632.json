    "description": "The reaction between C25H30N3+ (aq) and OH-(aq), as represented above, is first order with respect to C25H30N3+ (aq) in the presence of excess OH-(aq). A 10.0 mL sample of 0.10 M NaOH(aq) is mixed with a 10.0 mL sample of 2.5 x 10-5 M C25H30N3+(aq). A 5.0 mL sample of the mixture is quickly transferred to a clean cuvette and placed in a spectrophotometer, and the progress of the reaction is measured. The data are given in the table below.",
    "question": "Approximately how long did it take for 75 percent of the initial amount of C25H30N3+ (aq) to react?",
