    "description": "The reaction represented above goes essentially to completion. The reaction takes place in a rigid, insulated vessel that is initially at 600 K",
    "question": "A sample of CH3OH(g) is placed in the previously evacuated vessel with a pressure of P1 at 600 K. What is the final pressure in the vessel after the reaction is complete and the contents of the vessel are returned to 600 K?",
