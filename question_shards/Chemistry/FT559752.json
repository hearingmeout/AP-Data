    "question": "Fe3+(aq) + KSCN(s) → FeSCN2+(aq) + K+(aq)\n\nTo determine the moles of Fe3+(aq) in a 100. mL sample of an unknown solution, excess KSCN(s) is added to convert all the Fe3+(aq) into the dark red species FeSCN2+(aq), as represented by the equation above. The absorbance of FeSCN2+(aq) at different concentrations is shown in the graph below.\n\nIf the absorbance of the mixture is 0.20 at 453 nm, how many moles of Fe3+(aq) were present in the 100. mL sample? (Assume that any volume change due to adding the KSCN(s) is negligible.)",
