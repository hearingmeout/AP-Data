    "description": "Cu(s) + 4 HNO3(aq) → Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2 NO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nEach student in a class placed a 2.00 g sample of a mixture of Cu and Al in a beaker and placed the beaker in a fume hood. The students slowly poured 15.0 mL of 15.8 M HNO3(aq) into their beakers. The reaction between the copper in the mixture and the HNO3(aq) is represented by the equation above. The students observed that a brown gas was released from the beakers and that the solutions turned blue, indicating the formation of Cu2+(aq). The solutions were then diluted with distilled water to known volumes.",
