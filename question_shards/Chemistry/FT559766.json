    "question": "To determine the number of moles of Cu in the sample of the mixture, the students measured the absorbance of known concentrations of Cu(NO3)2(aq) using a spectrophotometer. A cuvette filled with some of the solution produced from the sample of the mixture was also tested. The data recorded by one student are shown in the table above. On the basis of the data provided, which of the following is a possible error that the student made?",
