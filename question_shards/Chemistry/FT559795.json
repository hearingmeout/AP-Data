    "question": "A particle view of a sample of H2O2(aq) is shown above. The H2O2(aq) is titrated with KMnO4(aq), as represented by the equation below. 2 MnO4−(aq) + 5 H2O2(aq) + 6 H+(aq) → 2 Mn2+(aq) + 5 O2(g) + 8 H2O(l) Which of the following particle views best represents the mixture when the titration is halfway to the equivalence point? (H2O molecules and H+ ions are not shown.)",
