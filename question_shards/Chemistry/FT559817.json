    "question": "2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)\n\nWhen H2(g) and O2(g) are mixed together in a rigid reaction vessel at 25°C, no reaction occurs. When the mixture is sparked, however, the gases react vigorously according to the equation above, releasing heat. Which of the following statements correctly explains why the spark is needed for the reaction to occur when the gases are originally at 25°C?",
