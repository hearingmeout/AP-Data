    "question": "Directions: Examples and equations may be included in your responses where appropriate. For calculations, clearly show the method used and the steps involved in arriving at your answers. You must show your work to receive credit for your answer. Pay attention to significant figures. White gold is a common alloy of gold and palladium that is often used in jewelry. The atomic radii of the metals are given in the table above. (a) A particular ring is made from an alloy that is 75 mole percent gold and 25 mole percent palladium. Using the box below, draw a particle-level diagram of the solid alloy consisting of 12 atoms with a representative proportion of atom types. Your diagram should clearly indicate whether the alloy is interstitial or substitutional. Use empty circles for gold and shaded circles for palladium. White-gold jewelry is often coated with rhodium to modify the color and durability. (b) A student hypothesizes that placing the ring in a 1.0 M solution of Rh(NO3)3(aq) will result in a reaction in which Rh metal is deposited on the white-gold ring. Based on the information in the table below, calculate E° for the reactions that may occur between ions in the solution and atoms in the ring, and indicate whether or not the student’s hypothesis is correct. Half-Reaction E° (V) Au3+(aq) + 3 e– → Au(s) 1.50 Pd2+(aq) + 2 e– → Pd(s) 0.92 Rh3+(aq) + 3 e– → Rh(s) 0.76",
