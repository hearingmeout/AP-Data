    "question": "Directions: Examples and equations may be included in your responses where appropriate. For calculations, clearly show the method used and the steps involved in arriving at your answers. You must show your work to receive credit for your answer. Pay attention to significant figures Propanoic acid, C2H5COOH, is an organic acid that is a liquid at room temperature. (a) An incomplete Lewis diagram for the propanoic acid molecule is provided in the box below. Complete the diagram, showing how the remaining atoms in the molecule are arranged around the carbon atom marked with an asterisk (*). Your structure should minimize formal charge and include any lone pairs of electrons. (b) Identify the hybridization of the carbon atom marked with the asterisk (c) Propanoic acid has a lower boiling point than butanoic acid, C3H7COOH. Identify all the types of intermolecular forces present among the molecules in propanoic acid. Which of the types of intermolecular forces that you identified in part (c)(i) is most responsible for the difference in boiling points of the two acids?",
