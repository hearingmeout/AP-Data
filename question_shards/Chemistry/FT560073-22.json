    "question": "HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(l) ⇄ H3O+(aq) + C2H3O2−(aq)\n\nThe dissociation of ethanoic acid, HC2H3O2(aq), is represented above. A student is given the task of determining the value of Ka for HC2H3O2(aq) using two different experimental procedures.\n\nThe student is first asked to prepare 100.0 mL of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) using a 2.000 M standard solution.\n\nCalculate the volume, in mL, of 2.000 M HC2H3O2(aq) the student needs to prepare 100.0 mL of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq).\n\nDescribe the procedure the student should use to prepare 100.mL of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) using appropriate equipment selected from the list below. Assume that the student uses appropriate safety equipment.\n\n100 mL beaker\n\n100 mL graduated cylinder\n\n100 mL volumetric flask\n\nEye dropper\n\n500 mL wash bottle filled with distilled water\n\n2.000 M HC2H3O2(aq) in a 50 mL buret\n\nUsing a pH probe, the student determines that the pH of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) is 2.92.\n\nUsing the pH value, calculate the value of Ka for HC2H3O2(aq)\n\nCalculate the percent dissociation of ethanoic acid in 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq)\n\nIn a separate experimental procedure, the student titrates 10.0 mL of the 2.000 M HC2H3O2(aq) with an NaOH(aq) solution of unknown concentration. The student monitors the pH during the titration. The following titration curve was created using the experimental data presented in the table.\n\nWrite the balanced net ionic equation for the reaction that occurs when HC2H3O2(aq) and NaOH(aq) are combined.\n\nCalculate the molar concentration of the NaOH(aq) solution.\n\nExplain how the student can estimate the value of Ka for HC2H3O2(aq) using the titration curve.",
