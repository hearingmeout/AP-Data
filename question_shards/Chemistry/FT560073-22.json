    "question": "HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(l) ⇄ H3O+(aq) + C2H3O2−(aq) The dissociation of ethanoic acid, HC2H3O2(aq), is represented above. A student is given the task of determining the value of Ka for HC2H3O2(aq) using two different experimental procedures. The student is first asked to prepare 100.0 mL of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) using a 2.000 M standard solution. Calculate the volume, in mL, of 2.000 M HC2H3O2(aq) the student needs to prepare 100.0 mL of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq). Describe the procedure the student should use to prepare 100.mL of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) using appropriate equipment selected from the list below. Assume that the student uses appropriate safety equipment. 100 mL beaker 100 mL graduated cylinder 100 mL volumetric flask Eye dropper 500 mL wash bottle filled with distilled water 2.000 M HC2H3O2(aq) in a 50 mL buret Using a pH probe, the student determines that the pH of 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) is 2.92. Using the pH value, calculate the value of Ka for HC2H3O2(aq) Calculate the percent dissociation of ethanoic acid in 0.115 M HC2H3O2(aq) In a separate experimental procedure, the student titrates 10.0 mL of the 2.000 M HC2H3O2(aq) with an NaOH(aq) solution of unknown concentration. The student monitors the pH during the titration. The following titration curve was created using the experimental data presented in the table. Write the balanced net ionic equation for the reaction that occurs when HC2H3O2(aq) and NaOH(aq) are combined. Calculate the molar concentration of the NaOH(aq) solution. Explain how the student can estimate the value of Ka for HC2H3O2(aq) using the titration curve.",
