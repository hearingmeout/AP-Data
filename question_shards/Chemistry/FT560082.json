    "question": "A 0.5 mol sample of He(g) and a 0.5 mol sample of Ne(g) are placed separately in two 10.0 L rigid containers at 25°C. Each container has a pinhole opening. Which of the gases, He(g) or Ne(g), will escape faster through the pinhole and why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "He(g) will escape faster because the He(g) atoms are moving at a higher average speed than the Ne(g) atoms.",

      {
        "label": "Ne(g) will escape faster because its initial pressure in the container is higher.",

      {
        "label": "Both gases will escape at the same rate because the atoms of both gases have the same average kinetic energy.",
