    "question": "At 127°C, the entire sample of I2 is observed to have vaporized. How does the mass of vessel 5 at 127°C compare to its mass at 27°C?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The mass is less, since the I2 is in the vapor phase.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mass is the same, since the number of each type of atom in the vessel is constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mass is greater, since the I2 will react with N2 to form NI3 , which has a greater molar mass.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mass is greater, since the pressure is greater and the particles have a higher average kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The mass is the same, since the number of each type of atom in the vessel is constant."
