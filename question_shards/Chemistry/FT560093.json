  "title": "5 vessels - mass of vaporized I2 to solid",
  "content": {
    "description": "At 27°C, five identical rigid 2.0 L vessels are filled with N2(g) and sealed. Four of the five vessels also contain a 0.050 mol sample of NaHCO3(s), NaBr(s), Cu(s), or I2(s), as shown in the diagram above. The volume taken up by the solids is negligible, and the initial pressure of N2(g) in each vessel is 720 mm Hg. All four vessels are heated to 127°C and allowed to reach a constant pressure.",
    "question": "At 127°C, the entire sample of I2 is observed to have vaporized. How does the mass of vessel 5 at 127°C compare to its mass at 27°C?",
