    "description": "At 27°C, five identical rigid 2.0 L vessels are filled with N2(g) and sealed. Four of the five vessels also contain a 0.050 mol sample of NaHCO3(s), NaBr(s), Cu(s), or I2(s), as shown in the diagram above. The volume taken up by the solids is negligible, and the initial pressure of N2(g) in each vessel is 720 mm Hg. All four vessels are heated to 127°C and allowed to reach a constant pressure.",
    "question": "The gas particles in vessel 3 at 27°C are represented in the diagram above. The lengths of the arrows represent the speeds of the particles. Which of the following diagrams best represents the particles when vessel 3 is heated to 127°C?",
