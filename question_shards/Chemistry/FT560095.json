    "question": "An acetate buffer solution is prepared by combining 50. mL of 0.20 M acetic acid, HC2H3O2(aq), and 50. mL of 0.20 M sodium acetate, NaC2H3O2(aq). A 5.0 mL sample of 0.10 M NaOH(aq) is added to the buffer solution. Which of the following is a correct pairing of the acetate species present in greater concentration and of the pH of the solution after the NaOH(aq) is added? (The pKa of acetic acid is 4.7.)",
