    "question": "A certain gas, XY(g), decomposes as represented by the equation above. A sample of each of the three gases is put in a previously evacuated container. The initial partial pressures of the gases are shown in the table below. The temperature of the reaction mixture is held constant. In which direction will the reaction proceed?",
