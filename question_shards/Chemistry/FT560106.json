    "description": "A 0.35 g sample of Li(s) is placed in an Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of water at 25°C. A balloon is placed over the mouth of the flask to collect the hydrogen gas that is generated.\n\nAfter all of the Li(s) has reacted with H2O(l), the solution in the flask is added to a clean, dry buret and used to titrate an aqueous solution of a monoprotic acid. The pH curve for this titration is shown in the diagram below",
