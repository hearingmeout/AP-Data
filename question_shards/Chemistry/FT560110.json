    "question": "A 1.0 g sample of a cashew was burned in a calorimeter containing 1000. g of water, and the temperature of the water changed from 20.0°C to 25.0°C. In another experiment, a 3.0 g sample of a marshmallow was burned in a calorimeter containing 2000. g of water, and the temperature of the water changed from 25.0°C to 30.0°C. Based on the data, which of the following can be concluded about the energy content for 1.0 g of each of the two substances? (The specific heat of water is 4.2 J/(g⋅°C).)",
