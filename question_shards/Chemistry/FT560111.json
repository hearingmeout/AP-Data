    "question": "The reaction between NO(g) and O2(g) to produce NO2(g) in a rigid reaction vessel is represented in the diagram above. The pressure inside the container is recorded using a pressure gauge. Which of the following statements correctly predicts the change in pressure as the reaction goes to completion at constant temperature, and provides the correct explanation?",
