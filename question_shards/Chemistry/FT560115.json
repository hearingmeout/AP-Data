    "description": "2 H2O2(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + O2(g)        ΔH° = −196 kJ/molrxn\n\nThe decomposition of H2O2(aq) is represented by the equation above. A student monitored the decomposition of a 1.0 L sample of H2O2(aq) at a constant temperature of 300. K and recorded the concentration of H2O2 as a function of time. The results are given in the table below.",
    "question": "The O2(g) produced from the decomposition of the 1.0 L sample of H2O2(aq) is collected in a previously evacuated 10.0 L flask at 300. K. What is the approximate pressure in the flask after 400. s? (For estimation purposes, assume that 1.0 mole of gas in 1.0 L exerts a pressure of 24 atm at 300. K.)",
