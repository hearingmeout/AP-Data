    "description": "2 H2O2(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + O2(g)        ΔH° = −196 kJ/molrxn\n\nThe decomposition of H2O2(aq) is represented by the equation above. A student monitored the decomposition of a 1.0 L sample of H2O2(aq) at a constant temperature of 300. K and recorded the concentration of H2O2 as a function of time. The results are given in the table below.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the data regarding how the order of the reaction can be determined?",

      {
        "label": "The reaction must be first order because there is only one reactant species.",

        "label": "The reaction is second order because 2 is the coefficient of H2O2 in the chemical equation.",

    "answer": "The reaction is first order if the plot of ln [H2O2] versus time is a straight line."
