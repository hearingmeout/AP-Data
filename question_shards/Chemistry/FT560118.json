    "description": "2 H2O2(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + O2(g)        ΔH° = −196 kJ/molrxn\n\nThe decomposition of H2O2(aq) is represented by the equation above. A student monitored the decomposition of a 1.0 L sample of H2O2(aq) at a constant temperature of 300. K and recorded the concentration of H2O2 as a function of time. The results are given in the table below.",
    "question": "Assume that the bond enthalpies of the oxygen-hydrogen bonds in H2O are not significantly different from those in H2O2 . Based on the value of ΔH° of the reaction, which of the following could be the bond enthalpies (in kJ/mol) for the bonds broken and formed in the reaction?",
