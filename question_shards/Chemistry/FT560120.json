    "question": "To gravimetrically analyze the silver content of a piece of jewelry made from an alloy of Ag and Cu, a student dissolves a small preweighed sample in HNO3(aq). Ag+(aq) and Cu2+(aq) ions form in the solution. Which of the following should be the next step in the analytical process?",
