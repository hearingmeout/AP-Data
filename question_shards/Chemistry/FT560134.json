    "question": "To maximize the yield in a certain manufacturing process, a solution of a weak monoprotic acid that has a concentration between 0.20 M and 0.30 M is required. Four 100. mL samples of the acid at different concentrations are each titrated with a 0.20 M NaOH solution. The volume of NaOH needed to reach the end point for each sample is given in the table above. Which solution is the most suitable to maximize the yield?",
