    "question": "In a paper chromatography experiment, a sample of a pigment is separated into two components, X and Y, as shown in the figure above. The surface of the paper is moderately polar. What can be concluded about X and Y based on the experimental results?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "X has a larger molar mass than Y does.",
