    "question": "Answer the following questions about ozone The O3 molecule has a central oxygen atom bonded to two outer oxygen atoms that are not bonded to one another. In the box below, draw the Lewis electron-dot diagram of the O3 molecule. Include all valid resonance structures. Based on the diagram you drew in part (a), what is the shape of the ozone molecule? Ozone decomposes according to the reaction represented below 2 O3(g) → 3 O2(g) ΔH° = − 285 kJ/molrxn The bond enthalpy of the oxygen-oxygen bond in O2 is 498 kJ/mol. Based on the enthalpy of the reaction represented above, what is the average bond enthalpy, in kJ/mol, of an oxygen-oxygen bond in O3? Ozone can oxidize HSO3−(aq), as represented by the equation below. HSO3−(aq) + O3(aq) → HSO4−(aq) + O2(g) A solution is prepared in which the initial concentration of HSO3−(aq) (6.4 × 10−4 M) is much larger than that of O3(aq) (1.0 × 10−5 M). The concentration of O3(aq) is monitored as the reaction proceeds, and the data are plotted in the graph below The data are consistent with the following rate law: rate = k1[O3] Based on the graph on the previous page, determine the half-life of the reaction Determine the value of the rate constant, k1, for the rate law. Include units with your answer. Considering the relative concentrations of the reactants, briefly explain why the data in the graph are also consistent with the following rate law: rate = k2[O3][HSO3−] Briefly describe an experiment that could provide evidence to support the rate law given in part (d)(iii)",
