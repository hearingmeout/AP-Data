    "question": "The structural formulas of glycerol and trichloropropane are given above. Both compounds are liquids at 25°C.\n\nFor each compound, identify all types of intermolecular forces present in the liquid. Explain why glycerol has the higher boiling point in terms of the relative strengths of the intermolecular forces.\n\nGlycerol (molar mass 92.09 g/mol) has been suggested for use as an alternative fuel. The enthalpy of combustion, ΔH°comb , of glycerol is −1654 kJ/mol. What mass of glycerol would need to be combusted to heat 500.0 g of water from 20.0°C to 100.0°C ? (The specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/(g⋅°C). Assume that all the heat released by the combustion reaction is absorbed by the water.)",
