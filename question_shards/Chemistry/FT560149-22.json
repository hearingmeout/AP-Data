    "question": "Overall reaction: Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2 H+(aq) + 2 HSO4−(aq) → 2 PbSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l) Cathode half-cell reaction: PbO2(s) + 3 H+(aq) + HSO4−(aq) + 2e- → PbSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l) The equations above represent reactions associated with the operation of a lead storage battery. The first is the overall reaction that occurs as the battery produces an electrical current, and the second is the half-reaction that occurs at the cathode. Determine the oxidation number of sulfur in the overall reaction. Write the equation for the half-reaction that occurs at the anode as the battery operates. After the battery has operated for some time, it can be recharged by applying a current to reverse the overall reaction. Calculate the time, in seconds, needed to regenerate 100. g of Pb(s) in the battery by applying a current of 5.00 amp",
