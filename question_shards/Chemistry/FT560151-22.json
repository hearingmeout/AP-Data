    "question": "A new element with atomic number 116 was discovered in 2000. In 2012 it was named livermorium, Lv. Although Lv is radioactive and short-lived, its chemical properties and reactivity should follow periodic trends. Write the electron configuration for the valence electrons of Lv in the ground state. According to periodic properties, what would be the most likely formula for the product obtained when Lv reacts with H2(g)? The first ionization energy of polonium, Po, is 812 kJ/mol. Is the first ionization energy of Lv expected to be greater than, less than, or equal to that of Po? Justify your answer in terms of Coulomb’s law. Shown below is a hypothetical mass spectrum for a sample of Lv containing 10 atoms. Using the information in the graph, determine the average atomic mass of Lv in the sample to four significant figures.",
