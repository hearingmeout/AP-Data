    "description": "Equimolar samples of CH3OH(l) and C2H5OH(l) are placed in separate, previously evacuated, rigid 2.0 L vessels. Each vessel is attached to a pressure gauge, and the temperatures are kept at 300 K. In both vessels, liquid is observed to remain present at the bottom of the container at all times. The change in pressure inside the vessel containing CH3OH(l) is shown below.",
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the change that takes place immediately after the CH3OH(l) is introduced into the previously evacuated vessel?",
