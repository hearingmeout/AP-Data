    "description": "Equimolar samples of CH3OH(l) and C2H5OH(l) are placed in separate, previously evacuated, rigid 2.0 L vessels. Each vessel is attached to a pressure gauge, and the temperatures are kept at 300 K. In both vessels, liquid is observed to remain present at the bottom of the container at all times. The change in pressure inside the vessel containing CH3OH(l) is shown below.",
    "question": "The temperature of the CH3OH is increased from 300 K to 400 K to vaporize all the liquid, which increases the pressure in the vessel to 0.30 atm. The experiment is repeated under identical conditions but this time using half the mass of CH3OH that was used originally. What will be the pressure in the vessel at 400 K ?",
