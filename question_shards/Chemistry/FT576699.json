    "question": "The temperature of the CH3OH is increased from 300 K to 400 K to vaporize all the liquid, which increases the pressure in the vessel to 0.30 atm. The experiment is repeated under identical conditions but this time using half the mass of CH3OH that was used originally. What will be the pressure in the vessel at 400 K ?",
