  "content": {
    "description": "A group of students was asked to recover Cu(s) from a blue-green aqueous solution containing an unknown concentration of Cu2+(aq) . The students took a 100.0 mL sample of the solution and added an excess of 1.0 M Na3PO4(aq), causing the Cu2+(aq) to precipitate as Cu3(PO4)2(s), as shown in step 1 below.\n\nStep 1\n\nThe Cu3(PO4)2(s) was filtered, dried, and weighed. Then the Cu3(PO4)2(s) was dissolved in a 3.0 M HCl(aq) solution, as shown in step 2 below.\n\nStep 2\n\nThe students added a strip of Zn(s) to the solution to recover the Cu(s), as shown in step 3 below.\n\nStep 3\n\nFinally, the Cu(s) was filtered, dried, and weighed.",
    "question": "The mass of the Cu(s) produced in step 3 was slightly more than the mass predicted from the\n3.8 g of Cu3(PO4)2(s) recovered from step 1. Which of the following could account for the\ndiscrepancy in the yield of Cu(s) from step 3 ?",
