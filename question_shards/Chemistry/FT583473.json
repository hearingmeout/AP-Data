    "question": "When a small amount of 12 M HNO3(aq) is added to a buffer solution made by mixing CH3 NH2(aq) and CH3NH3Cl(aq), the pH of the buffer solution changes from 10.64 to 10.62. Which of the following equations represents the reaction that accounts for the fact that the pH does not change significantly when the HNO3(aq) is added?",
