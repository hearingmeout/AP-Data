    "description": "Li3N(s) + 2 H2(g) ⇄ LiNH2(s) + 2 LiH(s) \nΔH° = -192 kJ/molrxn \nBecause pure H2 is a hazardous substance, safer and more cost effective techniques to store it as a solid for shipping purposes have been developed. One such method is the reaction represented above, which occurs at 200°C.",
