    "question": "Answer the following questions relating to HCl, CH3Cl, and CH3Br.\n\nHCl(g), can be prepared by the reaction of concentrated H2SO4(aq), with NaCl(s), as represented by the following equation.\n\nH2SO4(aq) + 2 NaCl(s) → 2 HCl(g) + Na2SO4(aq)\n\nA student claims that the reaction is a redox reaction. Is the student correct? Justify your answer.\n\nCalculate the mass, in grams, of NaCl(s), needed to react with excess H2SO4(aq) to produce 3.0 grams of HCl(g). Assume that the reaction goes to completion.\n\nHCl(g), can react with methanol vapor, CH3OH(g), to produce CH3l(g), as represented by the following equation.\n\nCH3OH(g) + HCl(g) ⇄ CH3Cl(g) + H2O(g)                    Kp = 4.7 × 103 at 400 K\n\nCH3OH(g), and HCl(g), are combined in a 10.0 liter sealed reaction vessel and allowed to reach equilibrium at 400 K. The initial partial pressure of CH3OH(g) in the vessel is 0.250 atm and that of HCl(g) is 0.600 atm.\n\nDoes the total pressure in the vessel increase, decrease, or remain the same as equilibrium is approached? Justify your answer in terms of the reaction stoichiometry.\n\nConsidering the value of Kp, calculate the final partial pressure of HCl(g) after the system inside the vessel reaches equilibrium at 400 K.\n\nThe student claims that the final partial pressure of CH3OH(g) at equilibrium is very small but not exactly zero.
