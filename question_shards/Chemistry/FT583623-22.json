    "question": "3Cu+(ag) + Au3+(aq) → 3Cu2+(aq) + Au(s) A student studying the reaction represented above constructs a voltaic cell as shown in the diagram below. The cell contains an Au(s) electrode in a beaker containing 1.00 M Au(NO3)3(aq) and a Pt(s) electrode in a beaker containing 1.00 M CuNO3(aq) and 1.00 M Cu(NO3)2(aq). The standard reduction potentials associated with the cell are given in the following table. Calculate the value of the standard cell potential, E °. Does the mass of the Pt(s) electrode increase, decrease, or remain the same as the cell operates? Justify your answer. An expanded view of the Au half-cell before the reaction occurs is shown in box A below. An expanded view of the Au electrode after the cell operates for a period of time is shown in box B below. Assuming that the representation in box A is accurate, explain what is wrong with the stoichiometry represented in box B. After the cell has operated for 30.0 minutes, 0.185 g of Au(s) is deposited on the Au electrode. Calculate the number of moles of Au(s) deposited. Calculate the average current that passed through the cell during the deposition of Au(s). The student adds some NaCl(s) to the half-cell that contains Cu+(aq) and Cu2+(aq), and a precipitate forms. Based on the information in the following table, determine the identity of the precipitate. Justify your answer with a calculation. Write the net ionic equation for the formation of the precipitate. The student predicts that the cell voltage will increase after the precipitate forms. Do you agree with the student’s prediction? Justify your answer.",
