    "question": "To spectrophotometrically determine the mass percent of cobalt in an ore containing cobalt and some inert materials, solutions with known [Co2+] are prepared and the absorbance of each of the solutions is measured at the wavelength of optimum absorbance. The data are used to create a calibration plot, shown below. A 0.630 g sample of the ore is completely dissolved in concentrated HNO3(aq). The mixture is diluted with water to a final volume of 50.00 mL. Assume that all the cobalt in the ore sample is converted to Co2+(aq) . What is the [Co2+] in the solution if the absorbance of a sample of the solution is 0.74? Calculate the number of moles of Co2+(aq) in the 50.00 mL solution. Calculate the mass percent of Co in the 0.630 g sample of the ore.",
