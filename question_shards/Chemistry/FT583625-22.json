    "question": "3 Ag(s) + 4 HNO3(aq) → 3 AgNO3(aq) + NO(g) + 2 H2O(l) A student investigates the reaction between Ag(s) and HNO3(aq) represented by the equation above. Predict the sign of the entropy change, ΔS°, for the reaction. Justify your answer. Use the information in the table below to calculate the value ΔHrxn°, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction, in kJ/molrxn. Based on your answers to parts (a) and (b), is the reaction more likely to be thermodynamically favorable at 25°C, or at 95°C? Justify your answer. The student runs the reaction using a 3 to 4 mole ratio of Ag(s) to HNO3(aq) . Suggest a method the student can use to isolate solid AgNO3 from the other products of the reaction.",
