    "question": "A student prepares three solutions, X, Y, and Z, as described in the table above. The values of Ka for the acidic species in the solutions are given in the table below.\n\nUsing the information above, write the letters of the solutions in the boxes below to rank the solutions in order of increasing pH. Explain your reasoning for the ranking.\n\nDoes the pH of solution Y increase, decrease, or remain the same when 100 mL of water is added? Justify your answer.\n\nThe student adds 0.0010 mol of NaOH(s) to solution Y, and adds 0.0010 mol of NaOH(s) to solution Z. Assume that the volume of each solution does not change when the NaOH(s) is added. The pH of solution Y changes much more than the pH of solution Z changes. Explain this observation.",
