    "question": "Elemental sulfur can exist as molecules with the formula S8. The S8 molecule is represented by the incomplete Lewis diagram above.\n\nThe diagram of S8 shows only bonding pairs of electrons. How many lone pairs of electrons does each S atom in the molecule have?\n\nBased on your answer to part (a), determine the expected value of the S–S–S bond angles in the S8 molecule.\n\nWrite the electron configuration for the S atom in its ground state.\n\nThe complete photoelectron spectrum for the element chlorine is represented below. Peak X in the spectrum corresponds to the binding energy of electrons in a certain orbital of chlorine atoms. The electrons in this orbital of chlorine have a binding energy of 273 MJ/mol, while the electrons in the same orbital of sulfur atoms have a binding energy of 239 MJ/mol\n\nIdentify the orbital and explain the difference between the binding energies in terms of Coulombic forces.\n\nPeak Y corresponds to the electrons in certain orbitals of chlorine atoms. On the spectrum shown, carefully draw the peak that would correspond to the electrons in the same orbitals of sulfur atoms.\n\n<math> <semantics> <mrow> <mn>3</mn><msub> <mrow> <mtext>&nbsp;S</mtext></mrow> <mn>8</mn> </msub> <mo>+</mo><msup> <mrow> <mtext>8&nbsp;OH</mtext></mrow> <mo>−</mo> </msup> <mo>→</mo><msubsup> <mrow> <mtext>8&nbsp;S</mtext></mrow> <mn>3</mn> <mo>−</mo> </msubsup> <mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn><mtext>&nbsp;HOOH</mtext></mrow> <annotation encoding=\"MathType-MTEF\">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+= feaahGart1ev3aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLn hiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr 4rNCHbGeaGqiFC0pg9uqGrpepeea0dXdHaVhbbe9u8qqaqFr0xc9pk 0xj9qqaqFj0dh9qq=xfr=JarFfpeea0=as0=fs0di9uqFr0=vr0=vr 0db8meaabaqaciGacaGaaeqabaWaaeaaeaaakeaaqaaaaaaaaaWdbi aaiodacaqGGaGaae4ua8aadaWgaaWcbaWdbiaaiIdaa8aabeaak8qa cqGHRaWkcaqG4aGaaeiiaiaab+eacaqGibWdamaaCaaaleqabaWdbi abgkHiTaaakiabgkziUkaabIdacaqGGaGaae4ua8aadaqhaaWcbaWd biaaiodaa8aabaWdbiabgkHiTaaakiabgUcaRiaaisdacaqGGaGaae isaiaab+eacaqGpbGaaeisaaaa@4D67@ </annotation> </semantics> </math>\n\nIn an experiment, a student studies the kinetics of the reaction represented above and obtains the data shown in the following table.\n\nUse the data in the table to do the following.\n\nDetermine the order of the reaction with respect to S8.
