    "question": "NH4NO3(s) → N2O(g) + 2 H2O(g)\nA 0.03 mol sample of NH4NO3(s) is placed in a 1 L evacuated flask, which is then sealed and heated. The NH4NO3(s) decomposes completely according to the balanced equation above. The total pressure in the flask measured at 400 K is closest to which of the following? (The value of the gas constant, R, is 0.082 L atm mol-1 K-1.)",
