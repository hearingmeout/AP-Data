    "question": "Answer the following questions in terms of thermodynamic principles and concepts of kinetic molecular theory.\n\n(a) Consider the reaction represented below, which is spontaneous at 298 K.\n\nCO2(g) + 2 NH3(g) → CO(NH2)2 (s) + H2O(l)     ΔHo298 = -134kJ\n\n(i) For the reaction, indicate whether the standard entropy change, ΔSo298 is positive, or negative, or zero. Justify your answer.\n\n(ii) Which factor, the change in enthalpy, ΔHo298 or the change in entropy, ΔSo298, provides the principal driving force for the reaction at 298 K? Explain.\n\n(iii) For the reaction, how is the value of the standard free energy change, ΔGo, affected by an increase in temperature? Explain.\n\n(b) Some reactions that are predicted by their sign of ΔGo to be spontaneous at room temperature do not proceed at a measurable rate at room temperature.\n\n(i) Account for this apparent contradiction.\n\n(ii) A suitable catalyst increases the rate of such a reaction. What effect does the catalyst have on ΔGo for the reaction? Explain.",
