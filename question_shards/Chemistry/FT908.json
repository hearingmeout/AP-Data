    "question": "A student pipetted five 25.00–milliliter samples of hydrochloric acid and transferred each sample to an Erlenmeyer flask, diluted it with distilled wa­ter, and added a few drops of phenolphthalein to each. Each sample was then titrated with a sodium hy­droxide solution to the appearance of the first per­manent faint pink color. The following results were obtained. Volumes of NaOH Solution First Sample.....35.22 mL Second Sample.....36.14 mL Third Sample.....36.13 mL Fourth Sample .....36.15 mL Fifth Sample.....36.12 mL Which of the following is the most probable ex­pla­na­tion for the variation in the student’s results?",
