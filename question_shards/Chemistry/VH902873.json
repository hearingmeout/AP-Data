The particles are arranged in a diagonal lattice such that each particle is directly adjacent to four others: to the top left, to the top right, to the bottom left, and to the bottom right. About a quarter of the particles are grey. Each grey particle is adjacent only to white particles.",

The two types of particles are arranged in a checkerboard pattern, such that each positively charged white particle is adjacent to four negatively charged grey particles, and that each negatively charged grey particle is adjacent to four positively charged white particles.",
