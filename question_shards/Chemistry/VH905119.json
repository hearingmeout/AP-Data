    "question": "A student has two samples of <math alttext=\"N a C l\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>NaCl</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, each one from a different source. Assume that the only potential contaminant in each sample is <math alttext=\"K C l\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>KCl</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. The student runs an experiment to determine the percent by mass of chlorine in each sample. From the results of this experiment alone, which of the following questions is most likely to be answered?",
