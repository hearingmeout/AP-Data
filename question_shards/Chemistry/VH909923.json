    "question": "The diagram above is a molecular model of a gaseous diatomic element that is just above its boiling point. Intermolecular forces between the gas molecules will cause them to condense into the liquid phase if the temperature is lowered. Which of the following best describes how the model is limited in its depiction of the phenomenon?",
