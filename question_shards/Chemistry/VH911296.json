    "question": "Diagram 1 above shows equimolar samples of two gases inside a container fitted with a removable barrier placed so that each gas occupies the same volume. The barrier is carefully removed as the temperature is held constant. Diagram 2 above shows the gases soon after the barrier is removed. Which statement describes the changes to the initial pressure of each gas and the final partial pressure of each gas in the mixture and also indicates the final total pressure?",
