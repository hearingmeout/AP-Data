Also shown are the results of transferring the entire contents of container 1 to container 2. No gases escape during the transfer. Assuming ideal behavior, which statement is correct regarding the total pressure of the gases after they are combined?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The total pressure of the gases in the mixture is the sum of the initial pressures of oxygen gas and nitrogen gas because pressure only depends on the total amount of gas when volume and temperature are held constant.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The total pressure of the gases in the mixture is lower than the sum of the initial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen because some of the energy of the particles will be lost due to an increase in the number of collisions.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The total pressure of the gases in the mixture is higher than the sum of the initial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen because of the intermolecular forces that develop between oxygen and nitrogen molecules.",
