The first curve is a bolded line that begins where the axes meet, and moves gradually upward and to the right initially. It then moves steeply upward and to the right, and reaches its maximum roughly one third of the way along the horizontal axis and two thirds of the way up the vertical axis. It then moves gradually downward and to the right, and begins to level off as it approaches the x axis, ending at a point about one fourth of the way up the vertical axis, above the end of the horizontal axis. The second curve is a dashed line that begins where axes meet, and moves more steeply upward and to the right than the first curve. It reaches its maximum above and to the left of where the first curve reaches its maximum, and then moves downward and to the right until it ends at the end of the horizontal axis.",
