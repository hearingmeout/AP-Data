The curve drawn with a solid line begins at the origin and moves steeply upward and to the right, reaches a peak, and begins to curve downward approximately one third of the way along the horizontal axis. It continues steeply downward and to the right until it levels off and merges with the horizontal axis. The curve drawn with the dashed line begins at the origin and moves steeply upward, staying to the left of the solid curve and reaching a peak that is higher than that of the solid curve and approximately one fifth of the way along the horizontal axis. The dashed line continues steeply downward to the right, crossing the solid curve and staying beneath and to the left of the solid curve as it levels off and merges with the horizontal axis to the left of where the solid curve levels off and merges with the horizontal axis.",
