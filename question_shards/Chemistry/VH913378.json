The O atom has one nonbonding pair of electrons. One H atom has a positive one charge. The two molecules are oriented so that the bond between C and the O atom with a negative one charge is in line with the bond between the H atom with a positive charge and the O atom in the second molecule. There is a dashed line connecting the O atom with negative one charge and the H atom with a positive one charge.",
