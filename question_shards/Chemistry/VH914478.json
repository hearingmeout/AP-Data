    "question": "The diagrams above show the ultraviolet absorption spectra for two compounds. Diagram 1 is the absorption spectrum of pure acetone, a solvent used when preparing solutions for an experiment. Diagram 2 is the absorption spectrum of the solute for which the absorbance needs to be measured to determine its concentration. When the student reads the absorbance of the solution at <math alttext=\"280 nanometers\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>280</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mtext>nm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, the result is too high. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the error in the measured absorbance?",
