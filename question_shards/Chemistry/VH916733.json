    "question": "The diagrams above represent solutes present in two different dilute aqueous solutions before they were mixed. Water molecules are not shown. When the solutions were combined, a precipitation reaction took place. Which of the diagrams below is the best particle representation of the mixture after the precipitation reaction occurred?",
