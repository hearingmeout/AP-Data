Data from the experiment are given in the table above. The final mass was determined after the sample was cooled to room temperature. Which of the following statements related to the experiment is correct?",

      {
        "label": "The mass of the sample decreased, so physical changes occurred as the metal first melted and then boiled out of the crucible.",

        "label": "The mass of the sample increased, so a chemical change occurred when bonds formed between the metal and another substance.",
