    "question": "A student obtains a liquid sample of green food coloring that is known to contain a mixture of two solid pigments, one blue and one yellow, dissolved in an aqueous solution of ethanol. Which of the following laboratory setups is most appropriate for the student to use in order to separate and collect a substantial sample of each of the two pigments?",
