    "question": "A second chemist repeated the three experiments and observed that the reaction rates were considerably greater than those measured by the first chemist, even though the concentrations of the reactants and the temperature in the laboratory were the same as they were for the first chemist. Which of the following is the best pairing of a claim about a most likely cause for the greater rates measured by the second chemist and a valid justification for that claim?",
