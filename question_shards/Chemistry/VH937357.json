    "question": "An advertisement for a commercial hand warmer claims that the hand warmer works because a chemical reaction in the hand warmer draws out the body’s own natural heat, causing a warming effect. Which of the following states the accuracy of the claim in the advertisement and best provides a correct scientific justification of the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The advertisement’s claim is inaccurate because heat flowing from the hands to the warmer would only happen if the chemical reaction was endothermic, which would cause the hands to feel colder.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The advertisement’s claim is inaccurate because heat flowing from the hands to the warmer would only happen if the chemical reaction was exothermic, which would cause the hands to feel colder.",
