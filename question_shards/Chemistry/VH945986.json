    "question": "The hydrolysis of sucrose is represented by the chemical equation above. This reaction is extremely slow in aqueous solution. However, when sucrase is added as shown in the diagram, the rate of the reaction is about 6,000,000 times faster. Based on this information, which of the following best explains the large increase in the rate of hydrolysis that occurs with the addition of sucrase?",
