The container is sealed and attached to a pressure sensor, as shown in the diagram above. The container is allowed to sit on the lab table for a few minutes as the pressure in the container is monitored at regular intervals. At the end of 2.00 minutes, some acetone liquid remains in the container. Which of the following best explains the pressure data presented in the table above?",
