The container is sealed and attached to a pressure sensor, as shown in the diagram above. The container is allowed to sit on the lab table for a few minutes as the pressure in the container is monitored at regular intervals. At the end of 2.00 minutes, some acetone liquid remains in the container. Which of the following best explains the pressure data presented in the table above?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The acetone heats up over time, causing more of it to vaporize at an increasing rate.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The acetone has completely vaporized after 1.50 minutes, so the pressure becomes constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The acetone vaporizes from the liquid at a constant rate, the rate of condensation increases until it becomes equal to the rate of evaporation, and then the pressure stays constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The acetone vaporizes from the liquid at a rate that is fast in the beginning but then slows down until the vaporization process stops completely.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The acetone vaporizes from the liquid at a constant rate, the rate of condensation increases until it becomes equal to the rate of evaporation, and then the pressure stays constant."
