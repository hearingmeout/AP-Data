    "question": "The diagram above represents the equilibrium between two isomers of 2-butene. The equilibrium constant, <math alttext=\"K sub c\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, is 1.2 at a certain temperature. Two identical vessels each contain an equilibrium mixture of the two gases at that temperature. The concentration of cis‑2‑butene in the second vessel is twice the concentration in the first vessel. What is the concentration of trans‑2‑butene in the second vessel compared to that in the first vessel?",
