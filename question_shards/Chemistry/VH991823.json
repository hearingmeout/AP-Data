    "question": "Graphite, an allotrope of carbon, is converted into cubic diamond through a process that may take a billion years or longer. As illustrated above, scientists can make synthetic diamonds using a certain process in about one week. However, these synthetic diamonds have carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Diamonds with carbon atoms in a cubic lattice are not produced even though they are thermodynamically more stable than hexagonal diamond. Which of the following best justifies why the synthetic process produces hexagonal diamond and not the more thermodynamically stable cubic diamond?",
