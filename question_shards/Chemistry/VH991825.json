A student cleans two iron nails and places each nail in a capped test tube. The following table gives the experimental conditions and the student’s observations after one week at room temperature.\nTest Tube Experimental Conditions Inside the Capped Test Tube Observations 1 Dry air No visible rust on nail 2 Air and water Rust suspended in the water and on the nail \nThe student claims that the formation of rust in test tube 2 shows that the reaction is thermodynamically favored. Which of the following justifications should the student use to explain why rust did not form in test tube 1 ?",
