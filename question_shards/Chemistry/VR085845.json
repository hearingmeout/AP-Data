The horizontal axis is labeled Bond Length, in picometers, and the numbers 0 through 600, in increments of 100, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Potential Energy, in kilojoules per mole, and the numbers negative 300 through 100, in increments of 100, are indicated. 100 is at the top of the vertical axis. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The curve begins at 240 picometers and 100 kilojoules per mole, and moves steeply downwards and slightly to the right, reaching 270 picometers and negative 150 kilojoules per mole. It curves steeply upwards and to the right, and then begins to level off, approaching 0 kilojoules per mole at 600 picometers.",
