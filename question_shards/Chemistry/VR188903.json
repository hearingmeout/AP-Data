The horizontal axis is labeled “Reaction Coordinate” and the vertical axis is labeled “Potential Energy.” The curve begins just above halfway up the vertical axis and initially moves horizontally to the right. About one fourth of the way along the horizontal axis, it moves upward and to the right until it reaches a peak near the top of the vertical axis, about halfway along the horizontal axis. The vertical distance from where the curve began to its peak is labeled E sub a. The curve then moves downward and to the right until it reaches a point about one fourth of the way up the vertical axis and three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis. It then moves horizontally to the right until it ends.",
