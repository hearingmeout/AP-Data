    "question": "In an experiment to estimate the enthalpy change of a reaction, a student makes two aqueous solutions, each containing one of the reactants. The student combines the solutions, both originally at the same temperature, in a calorimeter and records the final temperature of the mixture. In addition to the masses of the solutions and the temperature change of the mixture, which of the following pieces of information does the student need to calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction?",
