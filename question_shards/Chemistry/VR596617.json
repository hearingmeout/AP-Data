A dashed line extends from this point all the way across the coordinate plane to the end of the horizontal axis. The curve for I 2 begins near the top of the vertical axis, about one fourth of the way along the horizontal axis. It moves steeply downward and to the right crossing the dashed line to a point about one fifth of the way up the vertical axis, and one third of the way along the horizontal axis. It then moves upward crossing over the Br 2 curve, and to the right and begins to level off about two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis, below a potential energy of 0. It continues horizontally to the right until it ends. The curve for B r 2 begins just to the right of the I 2 curve, at the same point up the vertical axis, and moves steeply downward and to the right crossing the dashed line to a point below about one tenth of the way up the vertical axis, and to the right of the point where the I 2 curve reaches its minimum. It then moves upward and to the right and begins to level off about three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis, below a potential energy of 0 and the I 2 curve. It continues horizontally to the right until it ends.",
