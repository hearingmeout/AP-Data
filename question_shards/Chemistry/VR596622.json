The unknown liquids are propylamine, pentane, 2-propanol, and propanoic acid. The structures and molar masses of the compounds are shown in the table above. On the basis of this information, the student designed some experiments to identify the samples.",
    "question": "The student mixed samples of each of the four compounds with water. Only one of the four did not dissolve in water. Based on the structures of the molecules and the strengths and types of their intermolecular forces, the compound that did not dissolve is most likely",
