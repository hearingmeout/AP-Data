        "label": "The figure shows the graph of a titration curve in a coordinate plane. The graph is identical to the original graph. The horizontal axis is labeled “Volume of 0.10 molar N a O H Added, in milliliters,” and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “p H,” and the numbers 0 through 14, in increments of 2, are indicated. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The curve begins on the vertical axis at a volume of 0 milliliters and a p H of 3. It moves slightly up and to the right, then it moves up less steeply as it moves to the right, until it reaches a p H of 6 at a volume of 14 milliliters, and then it moves up more steeply. It moves vertically upward from a p H of 7.5 to a p H of 10.5 at a volume of 15 milliliters. It becomes less steep and reaches a p H of 11.5 at 16 milliliters. It then moves gradually upward and to the right until it ends at a p H of 12.3 at a volume of 20 milliliters.",
