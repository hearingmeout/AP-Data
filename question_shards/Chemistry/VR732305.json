      {
        "label": "Metal atoms are spherical; therefore, the solid metal can be easily drawn into wires that have a round cross-section.",

        "label": "Because of strongly directional bonding in the solid metal, the atoms both in front of and behind a given atom in a wire will bind together more strongly than the atoms not along the direction of the wire.",

        "label": "Because the mobile electrons attract the metal cations equally in all directions, the metal cations can move easily past one another as the metal is drawn into a wire.",

        "label": "Metal atoms tend to be much smaller than nonmetal atoms; therefore, they can move easily past one another as the metal is drawn into a wire.",
