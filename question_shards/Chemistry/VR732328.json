A horizontal line extends rightward from the value 0. There is a solid curve that is identical to the initial curve. There is a dashed curve that begins just to the right of the solid curve. It moves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches a minimum just above and to the right of where the solid curve reaches a minimum. It then moves upward and to the right and begins to level out as it approaches the horizontal line at 0. The curve becomes nearly horizontal just below the horizontal line, just to the right of where the solid curve becomes horizontal. It continues horizontally to the right until it ends.",
