The horizontal axis is labeled “Reaction Progress,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Energy.” No values are indicated on either axis. The curve begins just to the right of the vertical axis and just less than halfway up the vertical axis. It moves horizontally to the right at first, then moves upward and to the right until it reaches a first peak near the top of the vertical axis. It then curves downward and to the right until it reaches a point about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis. The curve then moves upward and to the right again, reaching a second peak, which is slightly shorter than the first peak. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches a point about one fourth of the way up the vertical axis, at a height lower than where it began. From here, the curve levels off and moves horizontally to the right until it ends far to the right of the vertical axis.",
