    "description": "Delivering our promise of a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly has strengthened the [United Kingdom] not weakened it, and now, having defeated the force of conservatism in granting devolution, let us continue to defeat the separatism, which is just the forces of conservatism by another name.\nAnd don't let the forces of conservatism stop devolution in Northern Ireland too.\nThose who are addicted to violence. Those who confuse any progress with selling out. They shouldn't determine Northern Ireland's future.\nWalk through Belfast. No armed soldiers.\nDrive through it. No road blocks.\nSource: Prime Minister Tony Blair’s speech to the Labour Party Conference, September 28, 1999.",
