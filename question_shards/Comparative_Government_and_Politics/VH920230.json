    "description": "“England predominates in the UK both economically and demographically. Its representatives have an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. It could be argued that devolution is a way for the other nations in the UK to distinguish themselves from England. The ‘English Question’ encompasses a number of questions about England’s governance. How, within the Union, should England be governed? Is there a way to allow England a separate voice within the UK without undermining the Union? Should power be devolved or decentralised, and if so how?\nThe governance of England is becoming a key concern for those considering the territorial constitution. Witnesses noted the absence of consideration of England when politicians discussed devolution, one of them calling it the ‘elephant in the room’ . . .\nProfessor [Sir] Jeffery [Jowell] noted the emergence of England as a theme in the 2015 general election. He argued: “[The English] feel short-changed by disparities in levels of public spending between the different parts of the UK; they feel this as a “fair share” argument, and that England is not getting its fair share. That transforms the debate about the Union.’”\nSource: House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution, 10th Report of Session 2015–16, HL Paper 149: “The Union and Devolution,” 2016.",
