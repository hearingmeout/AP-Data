    "description": "As with any social uprising, the unpredictable factor when trying to gauge the longevity of this particular movement is the strength of the state….\n\nWhat we are witnessing in Iran now should not be viewed as an isolated outcry, but rather ... a hybrid momentum that started in 1999 and led by students who later became involved in the Green Movement. They are belatedly joining the current unrest, which is evolving to include new social classes of people who were not at the center of previous protests.\n\nAlthough this momentum has not been linear, neither were the Arab uprisings in 2011. The Iranian demonstrators’ demands -- food subsidies, jobs and lower prices -- are perfectly attainable if the regime re-allocates its resources from the military to the economy. The fact that it is highly unlikely to do so, coupled with the demonstrators’ resentment, could inspire more protests in the near future that may forge a broader alliance between the middle class and the working class. It is unlikely that this simmering social movement will wait another decade to rear its head.\n\nSource: Geneive Adbo and Abdalla Hendawy, \"Iran's Latest Revolution Won't Fade Away,\" Bloomberg Opinion, January 19, 2018.",
