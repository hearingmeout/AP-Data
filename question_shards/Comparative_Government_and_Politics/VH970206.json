    "description": "From 1988 to 1993, with the active support of the <math alttext=\"I M F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>IMF</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, Mexico strengthened the process of macroeconomic stabilization and structural transformation that began in the wake of the 1982 debt crisis. Its strategy was . . . based on tight financial policies . . . ; comprehensive structural reforms, including privatization and trade and exchange liberalization; and a major restructuring of external debt.\nThe result was remarkable success on many fronts. A reduction in the fiscal deficit was achieved that should be an inspiration for many countries. Inflation was reduced from 160 percent in 1987 to 8 percent in 1993. Economic growth recovered from an average not much higher than zero in 1985-88 to 3 percent in 1989-93. . . . Mexico therefore entered 1994 with a strengthened economy, and an economy more deeply integrated into global markets, with its membership in <math alttext=\"NAFTA\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>NAFTA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> and impending accession to membership of the <math alttext=\"O E C D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>OECD</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. . . .\nSo what went wrong? . . . Mexico's weak external position was exacerbated in 1994 both by a series of unfavorable developments at home and abroad and by shortcomings in Mexico's policy response. . . .The uprising in Chiapas at the start of the year was the first in a series of dramatic adverse domestic developments that are well known; and also from early 1994 Mexico was confronted with a substantial rise in world interest rates.\nSource: https;//www.imf.org",
