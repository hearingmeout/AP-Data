    "description": "China has taken a multi-pronged approach in its economic relations with Africa, according to Deborah Brautigam [of] Johns Hopkins School of Advanced and International Studies. China is a significant source of  foreign direct investment in Africa; offers development loans to resource-rich nations . . . invests in agriculture; and develops special trade and economic cooperation zones in several states . . . “Chinese banks and companies are offering finance that allows them to secure a greater share of the business deals in Africa as part of their move to ‘go global.’ This brings with it risks for African borrowers—but also opportunities,” writes Brautigam.\nChinese financing comes often in the form of loans and credits provided by the People’s Bank of China, the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China, and the China-Africa Development Fund. Between 2000 and 2014, Chinese banks, contractors, and the government loaned more than $86 billion to Africa . . . However, these large loans are beginning to raise questions about debt loads in African countries, showing indications of a potential debt crisis.\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, 2019",
