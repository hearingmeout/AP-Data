    "question": "A code segment, which you will write, should determine whether the ones digit of the number stored in downloads appears exactly one other time in the number. If so, the code segment should print \"exactly once\"; otherwise, it should print \"not exactly once\".For example, if downloads has a value of 1734567, then the segment should print \"exactly once\" because the ones digit, which is 7, appears one other time. As another example, if downloads has a value of 325322, then the segment should print \"not exactly once\" because the ones digit, which is 2, appears two other times.Write a code segment to print the intended output. Your implementation must conform to the examples.",
