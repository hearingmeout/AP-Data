    "description": "This question involves writing two code segments that use information about downloaded songs.\n\nA record company uses the following variables to maintain information about each song in the company’s catalog.\n\ndownloads  is an  int  variable that represents the number of times a song was downloaded. Assume the value of this variable is positive.\n\nsongInfo   is a  String  variable that contains information about the song. The string consists of the artist name, followed by a hyphen (\"-\"),  followed by the album title, followed by another hyphen, followed by the song title. Assume that no other hyphens appear in the string.",
    "question": "A code segment, which you will write, should determine whether the ones digit of the number stored in  downloads  appears exactly one other time in the number. If so, the code segment should print  \"exactly once\"; otherwise, it should print  \"not exactly once\".\n\nFor example, if  downloads  has a value of  1734567,  then the segment should print  \"exactly once\"  because the ones digit, which is 7, appears one other time. \n\nAs another example, if  downloads  has a value of  325322,  then the segment should print  \"not exactly once\"  because the ones digit, which is 2, appears two other times.\n\nWrite a code segment to print the intended output. Your implementation must conform to the examples.",
