    "description": "This question involves writing two code segments that use information about downloaded songs.\n\nA record company uses the following variables to maintain information about each song in the company’s catalog.\n\ndownloads  is an  int  variable that represents the number of times a song was downloaded. Assume the value of this variable is positive.\n\nsongInfo   is a  String  variable that contains information about the song. The string consists of the artist name, followed by a hyphen (\"-\"),  followed by the album title, followed by another hyphen, followed by the song title. Assume that no other hyphens appear in the string.",
    "question": "A code segment, which you will write, should process the string  songInfo  and print the song title and artist name separated by the string (\" by \").\n\nFor example, if  songInfo  is  \"Carrie Ferriero-Greatest Hits-Tell Me Why\",  then the code segment should print  \"Tell Me Why by Carrie Ferriero\".\n\nAs another example, if  songInfo  is  \"Aniita-Mixtape 2-How Much More\",  then the code segment should print  \"How Much More by Aniita\".\n\nWrite a code segment to print the intended output. Your implementation must conform to the examples.",
