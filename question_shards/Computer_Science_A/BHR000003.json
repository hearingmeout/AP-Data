    "description": "The  WordGrid  class maintains a two-dimensional array of strings. A partial declaration of the  WordGrid  class is shown.\n public class WordGrid\n{\n private String[][] grid;\n\n/**\n * Returns the number of rows in grid that are ordered from \n * shortest string to longest string\n * Preconditions: grid has at least one row and at least two \n * columns.\n * No elements in grid are null.\n * Postcondition: grid is unchanged.\n */\n public int countOrderedRows()\n { /* to be implemented */ }\n\n/* There may be instance variables, constructors, \n and methods that are not shown. */\n}\n\nWhen an element of the two-dimensional array  grid  is accessed, the first index is used to specify the row and the second index is used to specify the column.\n\nWrite the  WordGrid  method  countOrderedRows.  The method should return the number of rows in  grid  that are ordered from shortest string to longest string. A row is considered ordered from shortest to longest string if each string element in the row, after the first element, has a length that is greater than or equal to the length of the previous element.\n\nFor example, suppose  grid  has the following contents.\n\nThe 2-D array has 5 rows and 4 columns. \n\nFrom top to bottom, the rows in the array are labeled with indices 0 through 4. \n\nFrom left to right, the columns in the array are labeled with indices 0 through 3. \n\nThe following presents each element’s values by row and then by column, from left to right. \n\nThe values in the 2-D array are as follows: \n\nRow 0: \n\nColumn 0: \"cat\" \n\nColumn 1: \"crane\" \n\nColumn 2: \"people\" \n\nColumn 3: \"hamster\" \n\nRow 1: \n\nColumn 0: \"dog\" \n\nColumn 1: \"slate\" \n\nColumn 2: \"bat\" \n\nColumn 3: \"green\" \n\nRow 2: \n\nColumn 0: \"blue\" \n\nColumn 1: \"audio\" \n\nColumn 2: \"adieu\" \n\nColumn 3: \"snazzy\" \n\nRow 3: \n\nColumn 0: \"yellow\" \n\nColumn 1: \"shirt\" \n\nColumn 2: \"hat\" \n\nColumn 3: \"store\" \n\nRow 4: \n\nColumn 0: \"about\" \n\nColumn 1: \"media\" \n\nColumn 2: \"stone\" \n\nColumn 3: \"canoe\"\n\nFor these contents of  grid,  countOrderedRows  should return  3  because there are three rows that contain strings that are ordered from shortest string to longest string (rows  0,  2,  and  4).",
