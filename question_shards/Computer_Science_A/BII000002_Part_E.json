    "description": "This question involves processing an email address to create three usernames.\n\nThe email address is stored in a  String  variable named  email,  which consists of a first name, followed by  \".\",  followed by a last name, followed by  \"@\",  followed by a domain name. Assume that the email address is stored in this format and the last name has at least three characters.\n\nThe usernames will be formatted as follows.\n\nUsername 1 will consist of the first name, followed by  \"_\",  followed by the last name.\n\nUsername 2 will consist of the first initial of the first name, followed by  \"_\",  followed by the last name.\n\nUsername 3 will consist of a randomly-selected character from the first name , followed by  \"_\",  followed by a sequence of three consecutive characters selected from a random position in the last name.\n\nExample 1\nSuppose  email  is equal to  \"joseph.martin@school.org\".\n\nUsername 1 will be  \"joseph_martin\".\n\nUsername 2 will be \"j_martin\".\n\nPossible values of Username 3 include  \"s_art\"  and  \"p_tin\".\n\nExample 2\nSuppose  email  is equal to  \"virginia.farmingham@school.net\".\n\nUsername 1 will be  \"virginia_farmingham\".\n\nUsername 2 will be \"v_farmingham\".\n\nPossible values of Username 3 include  \"g_ham\"  and  \"i_arm\".",
