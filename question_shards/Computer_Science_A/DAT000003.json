The first value is for index 0, the second value is for index 1, and so forth. \n\nEach element has the following attributes:\n\nPlayer ID \n\nScore \n\nThe objects in the ArrayList have the following contents: \n\nIndex 0: \n\nPlayer ID: \"DJK\" \n\nScore: 1090 \n\nIndex 1: \n\nPlayer ID: \"CJL\" \n\nScore: 2800 \n\nIndex 2: \n\nPlayer ID: \"JOY\" \n\nScore: 2000 \n\nIndex 3: \n\nPlayer ID: \"BEN\" \n\nScore: 500 \n\nIndex 4: \n\nPlayer ID: \"PTT\" \n\nScore: 3500 \n\nIndex 5: \n\nPlayer ID: \"JAY\" \n\nScore: 4500\n\nFor this example,  playerWithClosestScore  should behave as follows.\n\nThe call  playerWithClosestScore(1000)  should return  \"DJK\".\n\nThe call  playerWithClosestScore(2000)  should return  \"JOY\".\n\nThe call  playerWithClosestScore(3000)  should return  \"CJL\".\n\nThe call  playerWithClosestScore(4000)  should return either  \"PTT\"  or  \"JAY\".\n\nThe call  playerWithClosestScore(5000)  should return  \"JAY\".",
