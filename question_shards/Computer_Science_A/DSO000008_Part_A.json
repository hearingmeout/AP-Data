    "question": "A code segment, which you will write, should print output according to the following rules.If the length of text is greater than colWidth, then the value of text will be printed.Otherwise, the printed output will consist of colWidth characters contained between two \"|\" characters. The text between the \"|\" characters will consist of a sequence of periods (\".\"), followed by the value of text, followed by another sequence of periods. The printed output will have an equal number of periods on each side of text, if possible. If this is not possible, then there will be one fewer period on the left side of text than on the right side of text. The intended behavior is illustrated in the following table.
