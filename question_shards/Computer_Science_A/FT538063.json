    "question": "Consider the following instance variable, arr, and incomplete method, partialSum. The method is intended to return an integer array sum such that for all k, sum [ k ] is equal to arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[k]. For instance, if arr contains the values { 1, 4, 1, 3 }, the array sum will contain the values { 1, 5, 6, 9 }.\n\nThe following two implementations of / * missing code * / are proposed so that partialSum will work as intended.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?",
