    "question": "The following question is based on the following incomplete declaration of the class BoundedIntArray and its constructor definitions. \n\nA BoundedintArray represents an indexed list of integers. In a BoundedIntArray the user can specify a size, in which case the indices range from 0 to size - 1. The user can also specify the lowest index, low, in which case the indices can range from low to low + size - 1.\n\npublic class BoundedIntArray\n\n{\n\nprivate int[] myItems;   // storage for the list\n\nprivate int myLowIndex;  // lowest index\n\npublic BoundedIntArray(int size)\n\n{\n\nmyItems = new int[size];\n\nmyLowIndex = 0;\n\n}\n\npublic BoundedIntArray(int size, int low)\n\n{\n\nmyItems = new int[size];\n\nmyLowIndex = low;\n\n}\n\n// other methods not shown\n\n}\n\nWhich of the following is the best reason for declaring the data fields myItems and myLowIndex to be private rather than public?",
