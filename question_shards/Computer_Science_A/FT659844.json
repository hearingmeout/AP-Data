The user can also specify the lowest index, low, in which case the indices can range from low to low + size - 1. public class BoundedIntArray { private int[] myItems; // storage for the list private int myLowIndex; // lowest index public BoundedIntArray(int size) { myItems = new int[size]; myLowIndex = 0; } public BoundedIntArray(int size, int low) { myItems = new int[size]; myLowIndex = low; } // other methods not shown } Which of the following is the best reason for declaring the data fields myItems and myLowIndex to be private rather than public?",
