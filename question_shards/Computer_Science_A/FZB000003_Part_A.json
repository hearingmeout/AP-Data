Each race consists of one or more laps around a racetrack, starting with lap 1. Each lap consists of one complete trip around the racetrack.\n\nThe  RaceCar  class contains a helper method,  getLapTime.  You will write two methods in the  SimulateCarRace  class.\n public class RaceCar\n{\n /** \n * Returns the number of seconds it takes the race car\n * to complete the lap specified by the parameter\n */\n public double getLapTime(int lapNum)\n { /* implementation not shown */ }\n\n/* There may be instance variables, constructors,\n and methods that are not shown. */\n}\n public class SimulateCarRace\n{\n private RaceCar carOne;\n private RaceCar carTwo;\n\n/**\n * Simulates a race with numLaps laps and returns a String \n * indicating the outcome, as described in part (a)\n * Precondition: numLaps > 0\n */\n public String findWinner(int numLaps)\n { /* to be implemented in part (a) */}\n\n/**\n * Returns a shortened version of the parameter message with all \n * substrings that are equal to the parameter str removed, as \n * described in part (b) \n * Precondition: There are no overlapping occurrences of str\n * within message.\n */\n public String shortenMessage(String message, String str)\n { /* to be implemented in part (b) */}\n\n/* There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods \n that are not shown. */\n}",
