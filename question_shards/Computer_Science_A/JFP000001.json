    "description": "The  Cube  class represents cubes that are used in a board game. There are three types of cubes.\n\nNumber cubes, whose faces are labeled with the numbers 1 through 6\n\nLetter cubes, whose faces are labeled with the letters A through F\n\nColor cubes, whose faces are labeled with the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple\n\nA partial  Cube  class definition is shown.\n public class Cube\n{\n /** \n * Constructs a Cube object. If the parameter is\n * equal to \"number\", the cube will be a number\n * cube. If the parameter is equal to \"letter\", the \n * cube will be a letter cube.

The  CubePair  class should have a one-parameter constructor, a two-parameter constructor, and a  rollCubes  method.\n\nThe following table contains a sample code execution sequence and the corresponding results. The code execution sequence appears in a class other than  Cube  or  CubePair.\n\nStatement\nPossible Return Value\n(blank if no value)\nExplanationCubePair p1 = new \n CubePair(\"number\", \"color\");\n\nConstructs a  CubePair  object with two  Cube  attributes: one number cube and one color cube.p1.rollCubes();\n\"2yellow\"Returns a  String  consisting of the results obtained by rolling the two cubes associated with  p1.CubePair p2 = new \n CubePair(\"number\");\n\nConstructs a  CubePair  object with two  Cube  attributes that are both number cubes.p2.rollCubes();\n\"53\"Returns a  String  consisting of the results obtained by rolling the two cubes associated with  p2.CubePair p3 = new \n CubePair(\"letter\");\n\nConstructs a  CubePair  object with two  Cube  attributes that are both letter cubes.p3.rollCubes();\n\"DC\"Returns a  String  consisting of the results obtained by rolling the two cubes associated with  p3.\n\nAssume there is a precondition that all arguments passed to a  CubePair  constructor are equal to  \"number\",  \"letter\",  or  \"color\".",
