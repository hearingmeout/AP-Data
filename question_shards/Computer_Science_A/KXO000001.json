    "description": "A store sells rope only in whole-foot increments. Given three lengths of rope, in feet, the following code segment is intended to display the minimum length of rope, in feet, that must be purchased so that the rope is long enough to be cut into the three lengths.\nFor example, for lengths of 2.8 feet, 3 feet, and 5 feet, the minimum length of rope that must be purchased is 11 feet. For these values, the code segment should display 11. As another example, for lengths of 1.1 feet, 3.2 feet, and 2 feet, the minimum length of rope that must be purchased is 7 feet. For these values, the code segment should display 7.\nIn the following code segment, len1, len2, and len3 are properly declared and initialized double variables representing the three lengths of rope.\n double total = len1 + len2 + len3;\nint minLength = (int) (total + 0.5);\nSystem.out.print(minLength);",
