    "description": "A programmer wants to investigate whether players of an online game who are younger than 30 years old tend to spend more time playing the game than players who are 30 years old or older. Each player of the game must create an account with a unique username. The programmer has the following data sets available.\n\nData set 1 contains an entry for each player. Each entry contains the player’s birth date (month, day, and year) and username.\n\nData set 2 contains an entry for each player. Each entry contains the player’s username and the average number of hours the player spends playing the game each day.\n\nData set 3 contains an entry for each year since the game was released. Each entry includes the number of players who were born in that year.\n\nData set 4 contains an entry for each year since the game was released. Each entry includes a list of usernames of the players who created an account in that year.",
