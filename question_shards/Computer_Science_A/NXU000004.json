    "description": "A company is designing a program to evaluate the strength of a user’s password. The program needs to indicate if the password is “weak,” “medium,” or “strong” based on the following guidelines.\n\nA password with fewer than 8 characters is classified as “weak.”\n\nA password with 8 or more characters is classified as “medium,” where all characters are either numbers or letters. \n\nA password with 8 or more characters plus at least one special character (like !, @, or #) is classified as “strong.”",
