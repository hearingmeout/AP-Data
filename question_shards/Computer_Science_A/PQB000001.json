For each element, the first value is the appointment status and the second value is the room number.\n\nThe 2-D array has 5 columns and 6 rows.\nFrom top to bottom, the rows in the array are labeled with indices 0 through 5.\nFrom left to right, the columns in the array are labeled with indices 0 through 4.\nThe following presents each element’s contents by row and then by column, from left to right. Within a row, the first value is for column 0, the second value is for column 1, and so forth.\nThe values in the 2-D array are as follows:\nrow 0:\ncolumn 0: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 1: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 2: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 3: \"busy\" 206\ncolumn 4: \"busy\" 204\nrow 1:\ncolumn 0: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 1: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 2: \"busy\" 304\ncolumn 3: \"busy\" 206\ncolumn 4: \"busy\" 202\nrow 2:\ncolumn 0: \"hold\" 201\ncolumn 1: \"busy\" 105\ncolumn 2: \"busy\" 205\ncolumn 3: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 4: \"busy\" 205\nrow 3:\ncolumn 0: \"busy\" 204\ncolumn 1: \"free\" 100\ncolumn 2: \"busy\" 310\ncolumn 3: \"hold\" 110\ncolumn 4: \"free\" 100\nrow 4:\ncolumn 0: \"busy\" 204\ncolumn 1: \"hold\" 201\ncolumn 2: \"hold\" 310\ncolumn 3: \"busy\" 105\ncolumn 4: \"free\" 100\nrow 5:\ncolumn 0: \"busy\" 105\ncolumn 1: \"busy\" 208\ncolumn 2: \"hold\" 310\ncolumn 3: \"busy\" 105\ncolumn 4: \"free\" 100\n\nFor these contents of sched, the expected behavior of columnWithFewest is as follows.\n\nThe call columnWithFewest(\"busy\") should return 1 because \"busy\" appears two times in column 1 and more than two times in each of the other columns.\n\nThe call columnWithFewest(\"free\") should return either 2 or 3 because \"free\" appears one time in column 2, one time in column 3, and more than one time in each of the other columns.\n\nThe call columnWithFewest(\"hold\") should return 4 because \"hold\" appears zero times in column 4 and one or more times in each of the other columns.",
