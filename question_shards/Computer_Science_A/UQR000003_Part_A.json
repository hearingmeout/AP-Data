    "question": "Write the MessageBuilder constructor, which uses a helper method to create a message starting with the word specified by the parameter startingWord and assigns the message to the instance variable message. The constructor also counts the number of words in the message and assigns the count to the instance variable numWords. Each word in the message will be separated by a single space. A helper method, getNextWord, has been provided to obtain words to be added to the message. Each call to getNextWord returns the next word in the message based on the word most recently added to the message. When there are no more words to be added to the message, getNextWord returns null. Consecutive calls to getNextWord are guaranteed to eventually return null. Example 1 Consider the following calls to getNextWord, which are made within the MessageBuilder class. The return value of each call is used in the next call. Method CallReturn ValuegetNextWord(\"the\")\"book\"getNextWord(\"book\")\"on\"getNextWord(\"on\")\"the\"getNextWord(\"the\")\"table\"getNextWord(\"table\")null Based on these return values, a call to the MessageBuilder constructor with argument \"the\" should set the instance variable message to \"the book on the table\" and should set the instance variable numWords to 5. Example 2 Consider the following calls to getNextWord, which are made within the MessageBuilder class. The return value of each call is used in the next call. Method CallReturn ValuegetNextWord(\"good\")\"morning\"getNextWord(\"morning\")\"sunshine\"getNextWord(\"sunshine\")null Based on these return values, a call to the MessageBuilder constructor with argument \"good\" should set the instance variable message to \"good morning sunshine\" and should set the instance variable numWords to 3. Complete the MessageBuilder constructor. You must use getNextWord appropriately in order to receive full credit. /** * Builds a message starting with the word specified by the parameter and * counts the number of words in the message, as described in part (a) * Precondition: startingWord is a single word with no spaces. */ public MessageBuilder(String startingWord)",
