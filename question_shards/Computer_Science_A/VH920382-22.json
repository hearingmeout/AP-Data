Each employee is paid the same fixed amount per day. Each employee is paid an additional amount for each item they sold on that day. Daily Bonus: If the number of items sold that day by an employee is greater than a computed threshold, then the employee also receives a bonus equal to <math alttext=\"10\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent of the employee’s daily wages.

        "text": "The computeWages method is intended to calculate the wages for each employee and to assign them to the appropriate element of the array wages. For example, wages[3] should be assigned the wages for employee <math alttext=\"3\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. An employee’s wages consist of their daily wages plus a possible bonus and are calculated as follows. Each employee’s wages are equal to the fixed wage plus the number of items sold times the amount paid per item sold. If the employee sold more items than the bonus threshold, the employee also receives a <math alttext=\"10\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent bonus added to their wages. As described in part (a), computeBonusThreshold() returns 51.75 for the example array below. Suppose that fixedWage is 10.0 and perItemWage is 1.5. Employee <math alttext=\"0\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> did not sell more items than the bonus threshold, so employee <math alttext=\"0\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>’s wages are equal to 10.0 + 1.5 * 48, which evaluates to 82.0. This value will be assigned to wages[0]. Employee <math alttext=\"9\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> sold more items than the bonus threshold, so employee <math alttext=\"9\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> receives a <math alttext=\"10\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent bonus. Employee <math alttext=\"9\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>’s wages are equal to (10.0 + 1.5 * 60) * 1.1, or 110.0. This value will be assigned to wages[9]. (b) Write the method computeWages. Assume that itemsSold has been filled appropriately, and there are at least three employees in the array. Assume also that the wages array and the itemsSold array have the same length. Your solution must call computeBonusThreshold appropriately to receive full credit. /** Computes employee wages as described in part (b) * and stores them in wages. * The parameter fixedWage represents the fixed amount each employee * is paid per day. * The parameter perItemWage represents the amount each employee * is paid per item sold. */ public void computeWages(double fixedWage, double perItemWage)",
