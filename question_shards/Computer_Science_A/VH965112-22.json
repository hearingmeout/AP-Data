    "question": "SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.\n\nAssume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\n\nUnless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.\n\nIn writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n\nThis question involves the creation of user names for an online system. A user name is created based on a user’s first and last names. A new user name cannot be a duplicate of a user name already assigned. You will write the constructor and one method of the UserName class. A partial declaration of the UserName class is shown below.\n\npublic class UserName\n\n{\n\n// The list of possible user names, based on a user’s first and last names and initialized by the constructor.\n\nprivate ArrayList<String> possibleNames;\n\n/** Constructs a UserName object as described in part (a).\n\n* Precondition: firstName and lastName have length greater than 0\n\n* and contain only uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n*/\n\npublic UserName(String firstName, String lastName)\n\n{ /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }\n\n/** Returns true if arr contains name, and false otherwise. */\n\npublic boolean isUsed(String name, String[] arr)\n\n{ /* implementation not shown */ }\n\n/** Removes strings from possibleNames that are found in usedNames as described in part (b).\n\n*/\n\npublic void setAvailableUserNames(String[] usedNames)\n\n{ /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }\n\n}\n\n(a)   Write the constructor for the UserName class. The constructor initializes and fills possibleNames with possible user names based on the firstName and lastName parameters. The possible user names are obtained by concatenating lastName with different substrings of firstName. The substrings begin with the first character of firstName and the lengths of the substrings take on all values from 1 to the length of firstName.\n\nThe following example shows the contents of possibleNames after a UserName object has been instantiated.\n\nExample\n\nUserName person = new UserName(\"john\", \"smith\");\n\nAfter the code segment has been executed, the possibleNames instance variable of person will contain the following String objects in some order.\n\n\"smithj\", \"smithjo\", \"smithjoh\", \"smithjohn\"\n\nWrite the UserName constructor below.\n\n/** Constructs a UserName object as described in part (a).\n\n* Precondition: firstName and lastName have length greater than 0\n\n* and contain only uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n*/\n\npublic UserName(String firstName, String lastName)",
