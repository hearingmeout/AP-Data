An experimental farm is a rectangular tract of land that is divided into a grid of equal-sized plots. Each plot in the grid contains one type of crop. The crop yield of each plot is measured in bushels per acre. A farm plot is represented by the Plot class. A partial definition of the Plot class is shown below. public class Plot { private String cropType; private int cropYield; public Plot(String crop, int yield) { /* implementation not shown */ } public String getCropType() { return cropType; } public int getCropYield() { return cropYield; } } The grid of equal-sized plots is represented by a two-dimensional array of Plot objects named farmPlots, declared in the ExperimentalFarm class.

Assume that the ExperimentalFarm object f has been created such that its farmPlots array contains the following cropType and cropYield values. The following are some examples of the behavior of the getHighestYield method.
