The delimiters are balanced when both of the following conditions are satisfied; otherwise, they are not balanced.\n\nWhen traversing the ArrayList from the first element to the last element, there is no point at which there are more close delimiters than open delimiters at or before that point.\n\nThe total number of open delimiters is equal to the total number of close delimiters.\n\nConsider a Delimiters object for which openDel is \"<sup>\" and closeDel is \"</sup>\". The examples below show different ArrayList objects that could be returned by calls to getDelimitersList and the value that would be returned by a call to isBalanced.\n\nExample 1 The following example shows an ArrayList for which isBalanced returns true. As tokens are examined from first to last, the number of open delimiters is always greater than or equal to the number of close delimiters. After examining all tokens, there are an equal number of open and close delimiters.\n\nExample 2The following example shows an ArrayList for which isBalanced returns false.\n\nExample 3The following example shows an ArrayList for which isBalanced returns false.\n\nExample 4The following example shows an ArrayList for which isBalanced returns false because the second condition is violated.
