    "question": "Directions: SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA. Notes: Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate. Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied. In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit. 1. This question involves analyzing the difficulty levels of trivia questions used in a trivia game. Trivia questions are represented by the following TriviaQuestion class. public class TriviaQuestion { /** Returns the difficulty level of the trivia question, which is a value between 0 and * 100, inclusive */ public int getDifficultyLevel() { /* implementation not shown */ } // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown. } An array of the trivia questions that make up a trivia game is stored in a TriviaGame object. A partial declaration of the TriviaGame class is shown below. You will write two methods of the TriviaGame class. public class TriviaGame { /** An array of all trivia questions in the game * Guaranteed to have at least three entries and to contain only non-null entries */ private TriviaQuestion[] allQuestions; /** Returns the greatest difficulty level that appears in any trivia question in the game */ public int getMostDifficult() { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns the least difficulty level that appears in any trivia question in the game */ public int getLeastDifficult() { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns a String representing the overall rating of the trivia game as * \"Beginner\", \"Intermediate\", or \"Expert\", as described in part (a) */ public String getRating() { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ } /** Returns true if the trivia questions in allQuestions appear in order from least * difficulty to greatest difficulty and returns false otherwise, as described in part (b) */ public boolean isDifficultyIncreasing() { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ } // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown. } (a) Write the TriviaGame method getRating, which returns a String representing the difficulty level of the trivia game based on the adjusted average of the difficulty levels of the trivia questions in the game. The adjusted average is defined as the average of the difficulty levels with the least value and greatest value ignored. If there are multiple questions with the greatest difficulty level, only one is ignored. If there are multiple questions with the least difficulty level, only one is ignored. A trivia game consists of at least three trivia questions. Based on the adjusted average, the getRating method should return the following values. \"Expert\" if the adjusted average is at least 70.0 \"Intermediate\" if the adjusted average is at least 50.0 but less than 70.0 \"Beginner\" if the adjusted average is less than 50.0 For example, assume that game1 has been declared as a TriviaGame object and that q1, q2, q3, and q4 are properly declared and initialized TriviaQuestion objects. The following is an example of the contents of allQuestions in game1, showing each TriviaQuestion object and its difficulty level. In computing the adjusted average for the game1 object, the least value (50) and greatest value (90) are ignored. The adjusted average (87.5) is computed as the average of the remaining two values, 85 and 90. The method call game1.getRating() should return \"Expert\". Two helper methods, getMostDifficult and getLeastDifficult, are provided in the TriviaGame class. You must use getMostDifficult and getLeastDifficult appropriately to receive full credit. Complete method getRating. /** Returns a String representing the overall rating of the trivia game as * \"Beginner\", \"Intermediate\", or \"Expert\", as described in part (a) */ public String getRating()",

The expected length of a game is based on the expected time to answer each question in the game. Write a description of how you would change the TriviaQuestion and TriviaGame classes in order to support this modification. Make sure to include the following in your response. Write the method header for the gameLength method. Identify any new or modified instance variables, constructors, or methods aside from the gameLength method. Do not write the program code for this change. Describe, for each new or revised variable, constructor, or method, how it would change or be implemented, including visibility and type. You do not need to describe the implementation of the gameLength method. Do not write the program code for this change.",
