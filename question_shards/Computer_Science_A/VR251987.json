Notes: Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate. Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied. In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit. 4. This question involves analyzing strings. You will write the countRepeat method of the following StringAnalyzer class. public class StringAnalyzer { /** Returns a count of how many times smallStr occurs in largeStr, as * described in part (a) * Precondition: largeStr is not null; smallStr is not null. * The length of smallStr is less than the length of largeStr. */ public static int countRepeat(String largeStr, String smallStr) { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ } // There may be variables and methods that are not shown. } (a) The countRepeat method is used to count and return the number of times the string parameter smallStr appears in the string parameter largeStr. In the case of overlapping occurrences of smallStr, only the first occurrence is included in the overall count, as shown in the second and third calls to countRepeat in the following table of examples. Call to countRepeatuFEFF Return Value StringAnalyzer.countRepeat(\"BAAB\", \"AA\") 1 StringAnalyzer.countRepeat(\"AAAAA\", \"AA\") 2 StringAnalyzer.countRepeat(\"AABABABAA\", \"ABA\") 2 StringAnalyzer.countRepeat(\"ABBAABB\", \"ABA\") 0 Complete method countRepeat. /** Returns a count of how many times smallStr occurs in largeStr, * as described in part (a) * Precondition: largeStr is not null; smallStr is not null. * The length of smallStr is less than the length of largeStr. */ public static int countRepeat(String largeStr, String smallStr)",

        "text": "(b) A programmer would like to modify the StringAnalyzer class to limit the length of the large string that can be passed as input to countRepeat. The limit could vary between calls to countRepeat. A call to countRepeat with a value of largeStr that is longer than the maximum length would return –1. The programmer would like to implement this change without making any changes to the signature of the countRepeat method or overloading countRepeat. Write a description of how you would change the StringAnalyzer class in order to support this modification. Do not write the program code for this change. Make sure to include the following in your response. Identify any new or modified variables or methods. Describe, for each new or revised variable or method, how it would change or be implemented, including visibility and type.",
