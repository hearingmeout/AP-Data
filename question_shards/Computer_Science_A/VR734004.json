    "question": "SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.\n\nAssume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\n\nUnless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.\n\nIn writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n\nThis question involves methods that distribute text across lines of an electronic sign. The electronic sign and the text to be displayed on it are represented by the Sign class. You will write the complete Sign class, which contains a constructor and two methods.\n\nThe Sign class constructor has two parameters. The first parameter is a String that contains the message to be displayed on the sign. The second parameter is an int that contains the width of each line of the sign. The width is the positive maximum number of characters that can be displayed on a single line of the sign.\n\nA sign contains as many lines as are necessary to display the entire message. The message is split among the lines of the sign without regard to spaces or punctuation. Only the last line of the sign may contain fewer characters than the width indicated by the constructor parameter.\n\nThe following are examples of a message displayed on signs of different widths. Assume that in each example, the sign is declared with the width specified in the first column of the table and with the message \"Everything on sale, please come in\", which contains <math alttext=\"34\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>34</mn></math> characters.\n\nIn addition to the constructor, the Sign class contains two methods.\n\nThe numberOfLines method returns an int representing the number of lines needed to display the text on the sign. In the previous examples, numberOfLines would return 3, 2, and 1, respectively, for the sign widths shown in the table.\n\nThe getLines method returns a String containing the message broken into lines separated by semicolons (;) or returns null if the message is the empty string. The constructor parameter that contains the message to be displayed will not include any semicolons. As an example, in the first row of the preceding table, getLines would return \"Everything on s;ale, please com;e in\". No semicolon should appear at the end of the String returned by getLines.\n\nThe following table contains a sample code execution sequence and the corresponding results. The code execution sequence appears in a class other than Sign.\n\nStatement\nMethod Call Return Value (blank if none)\nExplanation\n\nString str;\n\nint x;\n\nSign sign1 = new  Sign(\"ABC222DE\", 3);\n\nThe message for sign1 contains <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> characters, and the sign has lines of width <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math>.\n\nx = sign1.numberOfLines();\n3\nThe sign needs three lines to display the <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math>-character message on a sign with lines of width <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math>.\n\nstr = sign1.getLines();\n\"ABC;222;DE\"\nSemicolons separate the text displayed on the first, second, and third lines of the sign.\n\nstr = sign1.getLines();\n\"ABC;222;DE\"\nSuccessive calls to getLines return the same value.\n\nSign sign2 = new  Sign(\"ABCD\", 10);\n\nThe message for sign2 contains <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math> characters, and the sign has lines of width <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>.\n\nx = sign2.numberOfLines();\n1\nThe sign needs one line to display the <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math>-character message on a sign with lines of width <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>.\n\nstr = sign2.getLines();\n\"ABCD\"\nNo semicolon appears, since the text to be displayed fits on the first line of the sign.\n\nSign sign3 = new  Sign(\"ABCDEF\", 6);\n\nThe message for sign3 contains <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> characters, and the sign has lines of width <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math>.\n\nx = sign3.numberOfLines();\n1\nThe sign needs one line to display the <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math>-character message on a sign with lines of width <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math>.\n\nstr = sign3.getLines();\n\"ABCDEF\"\nNo semicolon appears, since the text to be displayed fits on the first line of the sign.\n\nSign sign4 = new  Sign(\"\", 4);\n\nThe message for sign4 is an empty string.\n\nx = sign4.numberOfLines();\n0\nThere is no text to display.\n\nstr = sign4.getLines();\n null \nThere is no text to display.\n\nSign sign5 = new  Sign(\"AB_CD_EF\", 2);\n\nThe message for sign5 contains <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> characters, and the sign has lines of width <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>.\n\nx = sign5.numberOfLines();\n4\nThe sign needs four lines to display the <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math>-character message on a sign with lines of width <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>.\n\nstr = sign5.getLines();\n\"AB;_C;D_;EF\"\nSemicolons separate the text displayed on the four lines of the sign.\n\nWrite the complete Sign class.
