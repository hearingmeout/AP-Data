REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.\nAssume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\nUnless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.\nIn writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n\nThis question simulates birds or possibly a bear eating at a bird feeder. The following Feeder class contains information about how much food is in the bird feeder and simulates how much food is eaten. You will write two methods of the Feeder class.\n\npublic class Feeder\n\n{\n\n/**\n\n* The amount of food, in grams, currently in the bird feeder; initialized in the constructor and\n\n* always greater than or equal to zero\n\n*/\n\nprivate int currentFood;\n\n/**\n\n* Simulates one day with numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the bird feeder,\n\n* as described in part (a)\n\n* Precondition: numBirds > 0\n\n*/\n\npublic void simulateOneDay(int numBirds)\n\n{ /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }\n\n/**\n\n* Returns the number of days birds or a bear found food to eat at the feeder in this simulation,\n\n* as described in part (b)\n\n* Preconditions: numBirds > 0, numDays > 0\n\n*/\n\npublic int simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)\n\n{ /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }\n\n// There may be instance variables, constructors, or methods that are not shown.\n\n}\n\n(a) Write the simulateOneDay method, which simulates numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the feeder for one day. The method determines the amount of food taken from the feeder on this day and updates the currentFood instance variable. The simulation accounts for normal conditions, which occur <math alttext=\"95%\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>95</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the time, and abnormal conditions, which occur <math alttext=\"5%\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the time.\nUnder normal conditions, the simulation assumes that on any given day, only birds visit the feeder and that each bird at the feeder consumes the same amount of food. This standard amount consumed is between <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>50</mn></math> grams of food, inclusive, in <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>-gram increments. That is, on any given day, each bird might eat <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>, <math alttext=\"11\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>11</mn></math>, . . . , <math alttext=\"49\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>49</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>50</mn></math> grams of food. The amount of food eaten by each bird on a given day is randomly generated and each integer from <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>50</mn></math>, inclusive, has an equal chance of being chosen.\nFor example, a run of the simulation might predict that for a certain day under normal conditions, each bird coming to the feeder will eat <math alttext=\"11\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>11</mn></math> grams of food. If <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> birds come to the feeder on that day, then a total of <math alttext=\"110\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>110</mn></math> grams of food will be consumed.\nIf the simulated food consumed is greater than the amount of food in the feeder, the birds empty the feeder and the amount of food in the feeder at the end of the day is zero.\nUnder abnormal conditions, a bear empties the feeder and the amount of food in the feeder at the end of the day is zero.\nThe following examples show possible results of three calls to simulateOneDay.\n\nExample <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>: If the feeder initially contains <math alttext=\"500\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>500</mn></math> grams of food, the call simulateOneDay(12) could result in <math alttext=\"12\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>12</mn></math> birds eating <math alttext=\"20\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>20</mn></math> grams of food each, leaving <math alttext=\"260\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>260</mn></math> grams of food in the feeder.\n\nExample <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>: If the feeder initially contains <math alttext=\"1,000\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1,000</mn></math> grams of food, the call simulateOneDay(22) could result in a bear eating all the food, leaving <math alttext=\"0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> grams of food in the feeder.\n\nExample <math alttext=\"3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math>: If the feeder initially contains <math alttext=\"100\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>100</mn></math> grams of food, the call simulateOneDay(5) could result in <math alttext=\"5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> birds attempting to eat <math alttext=\"30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>30</mn></math> grams of food each. Since the feeder initially contains less than <math alttext=\"150\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>150</mn></math> grams of food, the feeder is emptied, leaving <math alttext=\"0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> grams of food in the feeder.\nComplete the simulateOneDay method.\n\n/**\n* Simulates one day with numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the bird feeder,\n* as described in part (a)\n* Precondition: numBirds > 0\n*/\npublic void simulateOneDay(int numBirds)\n\nClass information for this question\n\npublic class Feeder\n\nprivate int currentFood\n\npublic void simulateOneDay(int numBirds)public int simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)",
