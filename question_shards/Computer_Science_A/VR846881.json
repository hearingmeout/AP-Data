REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit. This question simulates birds or possibly a bear eating at a bird feeder. The following Feeder class contains information about how much food is in the bird feeder and simulates how much food is eaten. You will write two methods of the Feeder class. public class Feeder { /** * The amount of food, in grams, currently in the bird feeder; initialized in the constructor and * always greater than or equal to zero */ private int currentFood; /** * Simulates one day with numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the bird feeder, * as described in part (a) * Precondition: numBirds > 0 */ public void simulateOneDay(int numBirds) { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ } /** * Returns the number of days birds or a bear found food to eat at the feeder in this simulation, * as described in part (b) * Preconditions: numBirds > 0, numDays > 0 */ public int simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays) { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ } // There may be instance variables, constructors, or methods that are not shown. } (a) Write the simulateOneDay method, which simulates numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the feeder for one day. The method determines the amount of food taken from the feeder on this day and updates the currentFood instance variable. The simulation accounts for normal conditions, which occur <math alttext=\"95%\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>95</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the time, and abnormal conditions, which occur <math alttext=\"5%\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the time.Under normal conditions, the simulation assumes that on any given day, only birds visit the feeder and that each bird at the feeder consumes the same amount of food. This standard amount consumed is between <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>50</mn></math> grams of food, inclusive, in <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>-gram increments. That is, on any given day, each bird might eat <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>, <math alttext=\"11\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>11</mn></math>, . . . , <math alttext=\"49\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>49</mn></math>, or <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>50</mn></math> grams of food. The amount of food eaten by each bird on a given day is randomly generated and each integer from <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>50</mn></math>, inclusive, has an equal chance of being chosen.For example, a run of the simulation might predict that for a certain day under normal conditions, each bird coming to the feeder will eat <math alttext=\"11\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>11</mn></math> grams of food. If <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> birds come to the feeder on that day, then a total of <math alttext=\"110\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>110</mn></math> grams of food will be consumed.If the simulated food consumed is greater than the amount of food in the feeder, the birds empty the feeder and the amount of food in the feeder at the end of the day is zero.Under abnormal conditions, a bear empties the feeder and the amount of food in the feeder at the end of the day is zero.The following examples show possible results of three calls to simulateOneDay.Example <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>: If the feeder initially contains <math alttext=\"500\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>500</mn></math> grams of food, the call simulateOneDay(12) could result in <math alttext=\"12\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>12</mn></math> birds eating <math alttext=\"20\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>20</mn></math> grams of food each, leaving <math alttext=\"260\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>260</mn></math> grams of food in the feeder.Example <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>: If the feeder initially contains <math alttext=\"1,000\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1,000</mn></math> grams of food, the call simulateOneDay(22) could result in a bear eating all the food, leaving <math alttext=\"0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> grams of food in the feeder.Example <math alttext=\"3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math>: If the feeder initially contains <math alttext=\"100\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>100</mn></math> grams of food, the call simulateOneDay(5) could result in <math alttext=\"5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> birds attempting to eat <math alttext=\"30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>30</mn></math> grams of food each. Since the feeder initially contains less than <math alttext=\"150\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>150</mn></math> grams of food, the feeder is emptied, leaving <math alttext=\"0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> grams of food in the feeder.Complete the simulateOneDay method./*** Simulates one day with numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the bird feeder,* as described in part (a)* Precondition: numBirds > 0*/public void simulateOneDay(int numBirds)Class information for this questionpublic class Feederprivate int currentFoodpublic void simulateOneDay(int numBirds)public int simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)",

        "text": "(b) Write the simulateManyDays method. The method uses simulateOneDay to simulate numBirds birds or a bear coming to the feeder on at most numDays consecutive days.
