    "question": "SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.\nAssume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\nUnless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.\nIn writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n\nThis question involves a scoreboard for a game. The game is played between two teams who alternate turns so that at any given time, one team is active and the other team is inactive. During a turn, a team makes one or more plays. Each play can score one or more points and the team’s turn continues, or the play can fail, in which case no points are scored and the team’s turn ends. The Scoreboard class, which you will write, is used to keep track of the score in a game.\nThe Scoreboard class contains a constructor and two methods.\n\nThe constructor has two parameters. The first parameter is a String containing the name of team <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, and the second parameter is a String containing the name of team <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. The game always begins with team <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> as the active team.\n\nThe recordPlay method has a single nonnegative integer parameter that is equal to the number of points scored on a play or 0 if the play failed. If the play results in one or more points scored, the active team’s score is updated and that team remains active. If the value of the parameter is 0, the active team’s turn ends and the inactive team becomes the active team. The recordPlay method does not return a value.\n\nThe getScore method has no parameters. The method returns a String containing information about the current state of the game. The returned string begins with the score of team <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, followed by a hyphen (\"-\"), followed by the score of team <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, followed by a hyphen, followed by the name of the team that is currently active.\nThe following table contains a sample code execution sequence and the corresponding results. The code execution sequence appears in a class other than Scoreboard.\nStatementValue Returned(blank if none)ExplanationString info;Scoreboard game =   new Scoreboard(\"Red\", \"Blue\");game is a new Scoreboard for a game played between team <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, whose name is\"Red\", and team <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, whose name is \"Blue\".
