    "question": "SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit. This question involves a path through a two-dimensional (2D) array of integers, where the path is based on the values of elements in the array. When an element of the 2D array is accessed, the first index is used to specify the row and the second index is used to specify the column. The following Location class represents a row and column position in the 2D array. public class Location { private int theRow; private int theCol; public Location(int r, int c) { theRow = r; theCol = c; } public int getRow() { return theRow; } public int getCol() { return theCol; } } The following GridPath class contains the 2D array and methods to use to determine a path through the array. You will write two methods of the GridPath class. public class GridPath { /** Initialized in the constructor with distinct values that never change */ private int[][] grid; /** * Returns the Location representing a neighbor of the grid element at row and col, * as described in part (a) * Preconditions: row is a valid row index and col is a valid column index in grid. * row and col do not specify the element in the last row and last column of grid. */ public Location getNextLoc(int row, int col) { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ } /** * Computes and returns the sum of all values on a path through grid, as described in * part (b) * Preconditions: row is a valid row index and col is a valid column index in grid. * row and col do not specify the element in the last row and last column of grid. */ public int sumPath(int row, int col) { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ } // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown. } Write the getNextLoc method, which returns a Location object that represents the smaller of two neighbors of the grid element at row and col, according to the following rules.The two neighbors that are considered are the element below the given element and the element to the right of the given element, if they exist.If both neighbors exist, the Location of the neighbor with the smaller value is returned. Two neighbors will always have different values.If only one neighbor exists, the Location of the existing neighbor is returned.For example, assume that grid contains the following values.The following table shows some sample calls to getNextLoc.Method CallExplanationgetNextLoc(0, 0)Returns the neighbor to the right (the Location representing the element at row <math alttext=\"0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> and column <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>), since 3 < 11getNextLoc(1, 3)Returns the neighbor below (the Location representing the element at row <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> and column <math alttext=\"3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math>), since 15 < 16getNextLoc(2, 4)Returns the neighbor below (the Location representing the element at row <math alttext=\"3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math> and column <math alttext=\"4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math>), since the given element has no neighbor to the rightgetNextLoc(4, 3)Returns the neighbor to the right (the LocationuFEFF representing the element at row <math alttext=\"4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math> and column <math alttext=\"4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math>), since the given element has no neighbor belowIn the example, the getNextLoc method will never be called with row 4 and column 4, as those values would violate the precondition of the method.Complete the getNextLoc method./*** Returns the Location representing a neighbor of the grid element at row and col,* as described in part (a)* Preconditions: row is a valid row index and col is a valid column index in grid.* row and col do not specify the element in the last row and last column of grid.*/public Location getNextLoc(int row, int col)Class information for this questionpublic class Locationprivate int theRow private int theColpublic Location(int r, int c) public int getRow() public int getCol()public class GridPathprivate int[][] gridpublic Location getNextLoc(int row, int col)public int sumPath(int row, int col)",

        "text": "Write the sumPath method, which returns the sum of all values on a path in grid. The path begins with the element at row and col and is determined by successive calls to getNextLoc. The path ends when the element in the last row and the last column of grid is reached.For example, consider the following contents of grid. The shaded elements of grid represent the values on the path that results from the method call sumPath(1, 1). The method call returns 19 because 3 + 2 + 9 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 19.Write the sumPath method. Assume getNextLoc works as intended, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).
