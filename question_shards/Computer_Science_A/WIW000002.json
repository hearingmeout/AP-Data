A partial declaration of the  Passenger  class is shown.\n public class Passenger \n{\n /**\n * Returns the loyalty rating of the passenger,\n * guaranteed to be positive\n */\n public int getRating()\n { /* implementation not shown */ }\n\n/**\n * Returns the passenger's unique ID\n */\n public String getID()\n { /* implementation now shown */ }\n\n/* There may be instance variables, constructors,\n and methods that are not shown. */\n}\n\nThe  FlightSeatingChart  class represents the assignment of passengers to seats on an airplane flight. The arrangement of seats on an airplane is stored as a two-dimensional array, where each element may or may not be filled by a passenger. A partial declaration of the  FlightSeatingChart  class is shown.\n public class FlightSeatingChart \n{\n /** 2D array containing all passengers on a flight */\n private Passenger[][] chart;\n\n/** \n * Moves the passenger with the highest loyalty rating seated in\n * a row greater than upgradeRow to chart[upgradeRow][upgradeCol]\n * Preconditions: upgradeRow and upgradeCol are valid row and\n * column indices, respectively, in chart.\n * chart[upgradeRow][upgradeCol] is null.\n * There is at least one passenger in a row\n * greater than upgradeRow.\n */\n public void upgrade(int upgradeRow, int upgradeCol)\n\n/* There may be instance variables, constructors,\n and methods that are not shown. */\n}\n\nWhen an element of the two-dimensional array  chart  is accessed, the first index is used to specify the row and the second index is used to specify the column.\n\nWrite the  FlightSeatingChart  method  upgrade.  The method should find the passenger with the greatest loyalty rating seated in a row greater than  upgradeRow  and move that passenger to the seat at row  upgradeRow  and column  upgradeCol.  The  chart  element previously occupied by that passenger should be set to  null.  If there are multiple passengers that meet these criteria, then any of these passengers can be moved.\n\nFor example, suppose  chart  has the following contents. Each empty cell represents  null.  Each non-empty cell represents a  passenger  object, where the  int  is the passenger rating and the  String  is the passenger ID.\n\nThe 2-D array has 6 rows and 5 columns.\n\nFrom top to bottom, the rows are labeled with indices 0 through 5.\n\nFrom left to right, the columns are labeled with indices 0 to 4.\n\nThe following presents each element’s values by row and then by column, from left to right.\n\nThe values in the 2-D array are as follows:\n\nRow 0:\n\nColumn 0:\n\n72\n\n\"sk982\" \n\nColumn 1:\n\n619\n\n\"hg992\" \n\nColumn 2:\n\n45\n\n\"ls011\" \n\nColumn 3:\n\n504\n\n\"dh837\" \n\nColumn 4:\n\n87\n\n\"vh822\" \n\nRow 1:\n\nColumn 0:\n\n48\n\n\"dk984\" \n\nColumn 1:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 2:\n\n56\n\n\"ix873\" \n\nColumn 3:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 4:\n\n613\n\n\"hf733\" \n\nRow 2:\n\nColumn 0:\n\n208\n\n\"cl984\" \n\nColumn 1:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 2:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 3:\n\n405\n\n\"tt423\" \n\nColumn 4:\n\nnull\n\nRow 3:\n\nColumn 0:\n\n175\n\n\"fs743\" \n\nColumn 1:\n\n180\n\n\"cm408\" \n\nColumn 2:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 3:\n\n607\n\n\"mo002\" \n\nColumn 4:\n\n202\n\n\"ic676\" \n\nRow 4:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 1:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 2:\n\n177\n\n\"sm058\" \n\nColumn 3:\n\n128\n\n\"dl995\" \n\nColumn 4:\n\n184\n\n\"rc090\" \n\nRow 5:\n\nColumn 0:\n\n199\n\n\"ar522\" \n\nColumn 1:\n\n354\n\n\"cr321\" \n\nColumn 2: \n\n98\n\n\"pt108\" \n\nColumn 3:\n\nnull\n\nColumn 4:\n\n213\n\n\"rf999\"\n\nThe call  upgrade(1, 3)  will move the passenger at row  3  column  3  to row  1  column  3,  and will set row  3  column  3  to  null.  The contents of  chart  after the call are shown in the following figure.
