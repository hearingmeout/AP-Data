Write the  Shop  method  getPossibleAssemblies,  which should return the maximum number of assemblies that can be made from the available wheels and axles from all shelves. \n\nFor example, suppose  shelfArray  contains the following  Shelf  objects.\n\nThe array has 3 elements.\n\nEach element has 2 attributes:\n\nWheels\n\nAxles\n\nThe following presents each element’s contents from left to right, beginning with element 0.\n\nThe elements in the array have the following contents:\n\nElement 0:\n\nWheels: 2\n\nAxles: 1\n\nElement 1:\n\nWheels: 3\n\nAxles: 1\n\nElement 2:\n\nWheels: 5\n\nAxles: 2\n\nFor these contents of  shelfArray,  the method  getPossibleAssemblies()  should return  4.  There are a total of 10 wheels and 4 axles.
