    "description": "The  LapTracker  class, which you will write, is is used to count the number of laps a person walks around a track.\n\nLapTracker  objects are created by calls to a constructor with an  int  parameter that indicates how often to reset the  LapTracker,  with a precondition that the parameter is always positive. Newly constructed  LapTracker  objects start with a lap count of  0.\n\nThe  LapTracker  class contains an  addLaps  method, which adds laps to the lap count. This method has an  int  parameter that represents the number of laps to be added, with a precondition that the parameter is always positive. A  LapTracker  object repeatedly resets its lap count to 0 after a number of calls to  addLaps,  as indicated by its constructor parameter. The  addLaps  method returns an  int  that represents the lap count, as illustrated in the following table.\n\nThe table contains a sample code execution sequence and the corresponding results. The code execution sequence appears in a class other than  LapTracker.\n\nStatement\nReturn Value\n(blank if no value)\nExplanationint count;\n\nLapTracker amy =\n new LapTracker(3);\n\nA  LapTracker  object named  amy  is constructed with an initial lap count of 0. The lap count will reset to 0 after every third call to  amy’s  addLaps  method.count = \n amy.addLaps(8);\n8\n8 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.count = \n amy.addLaps(12);\n20\n12 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.count = \n amy.addLaps(10);\n30\n10 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.  The  addLaps  method has been called on  amy  three times, so the next time the lap count will restart from 0.count = \n amy.addLaps(11);\n11\nAfter the reset, 11 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.count = \n amy.addLaps(5);\n16\n5 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.count = \n amy.addLaps(13);\n29\n13 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.  The  addLaps  method has been called on  amy  three more times, so the next time the lap count will restart from 0.count = \n amy.addLaps(7);\n7\nAfter the reset, 7 laps are added to the total lap count for  amy.LapTracker eve =\n new LapTracker(2);\n\nA  LapTracker  object named  eve  is constructed with an initial lap count of 0. The lap count will reset to 0 after every second call to  eve’s  addLaps  method.count = \n eve.addLaps(20);\n20\n20 laps are added to the total lap count for  eve.count = \n eve.addLaps(13);\n33\n13 laps are added to the total lap count for  eve.  The  addLaps  method has been called on  eve  two times, so the next time the lap count will restart from 0.count = \n eve.addLaps(10);\n10\nAfter the reset, 10 laps are added to the total lap count for  eve.",
