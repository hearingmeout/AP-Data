A “mainly red” pixel is defined to be one in which the percentage of red is more than 50, and the percentages of green and blue are each less than 10. \n\nAssume that  redPct,  greenPct,  and  bluePct  are  int  variables that have been properly declared and initialized with values representing the percentages of red, green, and blue, respectively, in a pixel.",
