    "question": "The procedure Draw (length, direction) is used to draw a line segment length units long in a given direction (left, right, up, or down), starting at the current cursor position. The cursor is then repositioned at the end of the line segment that was drawn. Consider the following program, where the cursor starts in the upper left corner of a grid of dots. The dots are spaced one unit apart.\nDraw (1, right)\nDraw (2, down)\nDraw (1, left)\nDraw (1, right)\nDraw (1, up)\nDraw (1, left)\nWhich of the following represents the figure that is drawn by the program?",
