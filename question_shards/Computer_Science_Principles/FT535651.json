    "description": "The figure below represents a network of physically linked computers labeled A through G. A line between two computers indicates that the computers can communicate directly with each other. Any information sent between two computers that are not directly connected must go through at least one other computer. For example, information can be sent directly between computers A and B, but information sent between computers A and C must go through other computers.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements about security in the network is true?\n\nComputers A and D need to communicate with at least two additional computers in the network in order to communicate with each other.\n\nComputers B and C can communicate with each other without additional computers being aware of the communication.",
