    "question": "The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom-left square of the grid and facing toward the top of the grid.\n\nCode for the procedure Mystery is shown below. Assume that the parameter p has been assigned a positive integer value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …).\n\nWhich of the following shows a possible result of calling the procedure?",
