    "question": "A programmer wrote the program below. The program uses a list of numbers called numList. The program is intended to display the sum of the numbers in the list.\n\nIn order to test the program, the programmer initializes numList to [0, 1, 4, 5]. The program displays 10, and the programmer concludes that the program works as intended.\nWhich of the following is true?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The conclusion is incorrect; the program does not display the correct value for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5].",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] only confirms that the program works for lists in increasing order.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct."
