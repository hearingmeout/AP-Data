    "question": "A car manufacturer uses simulation software during the design process for a new car. Which of the following are reasons to use simulation software in this context?\n\nUsing simulation software can save the company money by helping to compare designs early in the process, before prototype cars are built.\n\nUsing simulation software can help to identify safety issues by providing data about how different mechanical components will interact in a wide variety of situations.\n\nThe manufacturer can present simulation software to customers to demonstrate different design possibilities.",
