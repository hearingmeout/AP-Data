    "question": "An algorithm will be used to identify the maximum value in a list of one or more integers. Consider the two versions of the algorithm below.\n\nAlgorithm I : Set the value of a variable max to − 1. Iterate through the list of integer values. If a data value is greater than the value of the variable max, set max to the data value.\n\nAlgorithm II : Set the value of a variable max to the first data value. Iterate through the remaining values in the list of integers. If a data value is greater than the value of the variable max, set max to the data value.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the behavior of the two algorithms?",
