    "question": "Two grids are shown below. Each grid contains a robot represented as a triangle. Both robots are initially facing left. Each robot can move into a white or gray square, but cannot move into a black region.\n\nFor each grid, the program below is intended to move the robot to the gray square. The program uses the procedure Goal_Reached ( ), which evaluates to true if the robot is in the gray square and evaluates to false otherwise.\n\nFor which of the grids does the program correctly move the robot to the gray square?",
