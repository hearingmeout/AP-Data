    "question": "The following question uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom left square of the grid and facing right.\n\nConsider the following code segment, which moves the robot in the grid.\n\nWhich of the following shows the location of the robot after running the code segment?",
