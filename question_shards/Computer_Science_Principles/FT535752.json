    "description": "The program segment below is intended to move a robot in a grid to a gray square. The program segment uses the procedure GoalReached, which evaluates to true if the robot is in the gray square and evaluates to false otherwise. The robot in each grid is represented as a triangle and is initially facing left. The robot can move into a white or gray square but cannot move into a black region.",
    "question": "For which of the following grids does the program NOT correctly move the robot to the gray square?",
