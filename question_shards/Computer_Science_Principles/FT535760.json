    "question": "A summer camp offers a morning session and an afternoon session. The list morningList contains the names of all children attending the morning session, and the list afternoonList contains the names of all children attending the afternoon session.\n\nOnly children who attend both sessions eat lunch at the camp. The camp director wants to create lunchList, which will contain the names of children attending both sessions.\n\nThe following code segment is intended to create lunchList, which is initially empty. It uses the procedure IsFound (list, name), which returns true if name is found in list and returns false otherwise.\n\nWhich of the following could replace <MISSING CODE> so that the code segment works as intended?",
