    "description": "A student is creating a procedure to determine whether the weather for a particular month was considered very hot. The procedure takes as input a list containing daily high temperatures for a particular month. The procedure is intended to return  if the daily high temperature was at least 90 degrees for a majority of days in the month and return  otherwise.",
