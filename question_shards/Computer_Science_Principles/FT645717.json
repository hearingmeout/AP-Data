The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom right square of the grid and facing toward the top of the grid.\n\nThe following programs are each intended to move the robot to the gray square. Program II uses the procedure , which returns  if the robot is in the gray square and returns \n otherwise.",
