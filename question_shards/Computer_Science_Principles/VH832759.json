    "description": "A chain of retail stores uses software to manage telephone calls from customers. The system was recently upgraded. Customers interacted with the original system using their phone keypad. Customers interact with the upgraded system using their voice.\n\nThe upgraded system (but not the original system) stores all information from the calling session in a database for future reference. This includes the customer’s telephone number and any information provided by the customer (name, address, order number, credit card number, etc.).\n\nThe original system and the upgraded system are described in the following flowcharts. Each flowchart uses the following blocks.\n\nBlock\n Explanation\n\nOval\n The start of the algorithm\n\nParallelogram\n An input or output step\n\nDiamond\n A conditional or decision step, where execution proceeds to the side labeled “Yes” if the answer to the question is yes and to the side labeled “No” if the answer to the question is no\n\nRectangle\n The result of the algorithm",
