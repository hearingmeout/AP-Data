    "description": "A student’s overall course grade in a certain class is based on the student’s scores on individual assignments. The course grade is calculated by dropping the student’s lowest individual assignment score and averaging the remaining scores.\n\nFor example, if a particular student has individual assignment scores of 85, 75, 90, and 95, the lowest score (75) is dropped. The calculated course grade is <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 85 plus 90 plus 95, close parenthesis, divided by 3, equals 90\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>85</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>90</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>95</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>90</mn></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
