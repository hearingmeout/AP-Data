    "description": "A group of planners are using a simulation to examine whether or not a park that they are designing is going to affect foot traffic in the area. The simulation uses a model that includes input variables for the park such as the number of entrances, sidewalks, and bike trails and the square footage of open space (grassy areas). The simulation can then be run multiple times using different values for the input variables to represent different park designs.\n\nHowever, the simulation takes a very long time to run. The planners update the model by removing some variables they consider less important than others.",
    "question": "Of the following, which is the most likely effect the updated model will have on the simulation?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because the time required for simulations generally depends on the complexity of the model used.",

      {
        "label": "The updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because simulations that use older models tend to require more time to run than simulations that use newer models.",

      {
        "label": "The updated model is unlikely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because the simulation is computationally complex, regardless of the model used.",

      {
        "label": "The updated model is unlikely to provide any benefit because removing details from a model will compromise the accuracy of the simulation.",
