    "description": "A file storage application allows users to save their files on cloud servers. A group of researchers gathered user data for the first eight years of the application’s existence. Some of the data are summarized in the following graphs. The line graph on the left shows the number of registered users each year. The line graph on the right shows the total amount of data stored by all users each year. The circle graph shows the distribution of file sizes currently stored by all users.\n\n(note: 1 MB = 1,000 KB)",
    "question": "Which of the following observations is most consistent with the information in the circle graph?",
