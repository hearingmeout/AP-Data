    "question": "A certain programming language uses 4-bit binary sequences to represent nonnegative integers. For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The correct sum of 29 will be assigned to the variable total.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent either of the values 14 or 15.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A round-off error will occur because the decimal values 14 and 15 are represented as approximations due to the fixed number of bits used to represent numbers.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15."
