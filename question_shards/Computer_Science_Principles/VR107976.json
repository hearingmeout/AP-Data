    "description": "A certain computer has two identical processors that are able to run in parallel. The following table indicates the amount of time it takes to execute each of four processes on a single processor. Assume that none of the processes is dependent on any of the other processes.\n\nProcess\nExecution Time on Either Processor\n\nP\n30 seconds\n\nQ\n10 seconds\n\nR\n20 seconds\n\nS\n15 seconds",
