    "description": "The figure below represents a network of physically linked devices labeled A through I. A line between two devices indicates that the devices can communicate directly with each other.\nAny information sent between two devices that are not directly connected must go through at least one other device. For example, in the network represented below, information can be sent directly between A and B, but information sent between devices A and G must go through other devices.",
