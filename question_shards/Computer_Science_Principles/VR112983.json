    "description": "A certain computer has two identical processors that are able to run in parallel. Each processor can run only one process at a time, and each process must be executed on a single processor. The following table indicates the amount of time it takes to execute each of three processes on a single processor. Assume that none of the processes are dependent on any of the other processes.",
