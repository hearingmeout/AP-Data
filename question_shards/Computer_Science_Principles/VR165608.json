    "question": "A student is developing a program that allows users to look up the definitions of words that appear in a book.\nThe student plans to perform a large number of searches through a dictionary containing words and their definitions. The student will use a procedure written by a computer scientist to quickly search the dictionary (and knows that the procedure will return a definition if one is available). The student cannot modify the search procedure written by the computer scientist but can call the procedure by supplying a word.\nWhich of the following is a true statement about the student’s use of the computer scientist’s search procedure?",
