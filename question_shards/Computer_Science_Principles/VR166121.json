    "question": "A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Running a simulation requires more time to generate data from trials than observing the crowd exiting the arena at various events.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Running a simulation requires a large number of observations to be collected before it can be used to explore a problem.",
