If the player spins A, the score is 10. If the player spins B, the score is 5. If the player spins C or D, the score is -1.\n\nThe following code segment is intended to implement the game.\n\nWhich of the following could be used as a replacement for <MISSING STATEMENT> so the code segment works as intended?",
