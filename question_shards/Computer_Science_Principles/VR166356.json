    "question": "The student later decides to modify the procedure to calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to max, which represents any positive integer greater than 1. Which of the following changes should be made to the procedure to meet the student’s goal? The procedure should take max as an input parameter. The condition in the REPEAT UNTIL block should be changed to count > max. The condition in the REPEAT UNTIL block should be changed to max < 5.",
