Let scoreA represent the number of correct questions for Team A, scoreB represent the number of correct questions for Team B, and scoreC represent the number of correct questions for Team C. Assuming no two teams get the same number of correct questions, which of the following code segments correctly displays the team with the highest number of correct questions?",
