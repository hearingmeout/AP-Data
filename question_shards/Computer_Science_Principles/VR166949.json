Photographs whose photographer or year are unknown are to be ignored.\n\nOnce the algorithm is complete, the desired entry will appear in the first row of the spreadsheet. If there are multiple entries that meet the desired criteria, then any of them can appear in the first row.\n\nThe student has the following actions available.\n\nAction\nExplanation\n\nFilter by photographer\nRemoves entries whose photographer is \"(unknown)\"\n\nFilter by year\nRemoves entries whose year is -1\n\nSort by subject\nSorts the rows in the spreadsheet on column B alphabetically from A to Z\n\nSort by year\nSorts the rows in the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest\n\nAssume that applying either of the filters will not change the relative order of the rows remaining in the spreadsheet.\n\nWhich of the following sequences of steps can be used to identify the desired entry?\n\nSelect two answers.",
