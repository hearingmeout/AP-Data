    "description": "A programmer is creating an algorithm that will be used to turn on the motor to open the gate in a parking garage. The specifications for the algorithm are as follows.",
    "question": "The gate should not open when the time is outside of business hours. The motor should not turn on unless the gate sensor is activated. The motor should not turn on if the gate is already open. Which of the following algorithms can be used to open the gate under the appropriate conditions?",
