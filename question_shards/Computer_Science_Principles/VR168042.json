    "question": "The figure below shows four grids, each containing a robot represented as a triangle. The robot cannot move to a black square or move beyond the edge of the grid.\n\nWhich of the following algorithms will allow the robot to make a single circuit around the rectangular region of black squares, finishing in the exact location and direction that it started in each of the four grids?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Step 1:\n Keep moving forward, one square at a time, until the square  to the right of the robot is black.\n Step 2:\n Turn right and move one  square forward.\n Step 3:\n Repeat steps 1 and 2 three more times.",
