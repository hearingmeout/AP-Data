    "description": "The figure below shows four grids, each containing a robot represented as a triangle. The robot cannot move to a black square or move beyond the edge of the grid.",
    "question": "Which of the following algorithms will allow the robot to make a single circuit around the rectangular region of black squares, finishing in the exact location and direction that it started in each of the four grids?",
