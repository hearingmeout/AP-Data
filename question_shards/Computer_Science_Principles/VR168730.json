    "question": "The list listOne is a sorted list of numbers that contains 700 elements. The list listTwo is a sorted list of numbers that contains 900 elements. Let x represent the maximum number of list elements that will need to be examined when performing a binary search for a value in listOne, and let y represent the maximum number of list elements that will need to be examined when performing a binary search for a value in listTwo. Which of the following statements about x and y is true?",
