    "question": "The following question uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially facing toward the top of the grid.\n\nThe following code segment moves the robot around the grid. Assume that n is a positive integer.\n\nLine 1: count <math alttext=\"←\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>←</mo></mrow></math> 0\n\nLine 2: REPEAT n TIMES\n\nLine 3: {\n\nLine 4:    REPEAT 2 TIMES\n\nLine 5:    {\n\nLine 6:       MOVE_FORWARD()\n\nLine 7:    }\n\nLine 8:    ROTATE_RIGHT()\n\nLine 9: }\n\nConsider the goal of modifying the code segment to count the number of squares the robot visits before execution terminates. Which of the following modifications can be made to the code segment to correctly count the number of squares the robot moves to?",
