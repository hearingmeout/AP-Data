The PPR that you assemble and upload here will be helpful in responding to the following sample written response questions. \n\nYou will create a PDF document containing screen captures of the following code segments. Screen captures should not be blurry, and text should be at least 10-pointfont size. Your code segments should not include any comments. \n\nNOTE: For the end of course exam administration, you will create your Personalized Project Reference in the AP Digital Portfolio.\n\nProcedure: Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure.\n\ni. The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:\n\nDefines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary)\n\nContains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure\n\nImplements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and Iteration\n\nii. The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.\n\nList: Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program.\n\ni. The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.\n\nii. The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.",
