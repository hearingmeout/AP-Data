    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\n(This passage is taken from a book that examines Canadian book clubs.)\n\nSo pronounced is the book-club phenomenon that the format has spread to other venues and media, the most famous of these being the ‘book club’ component of Oprah Winfrey’s television talk show. Staged like an actual book-group meeting, with invited discussants and a cozy living-room setting, the Winfrey show can boost a featured title to instant bestsellerdom and turn authors into stars. There are now ‘book clubs’ online, in bookstores, and functioning as consumer focus groups for publishers.1 Colleges, bookstores, and resorts have recently begun to develop ‘readers’ retreats.’2 Newsletters, magazines, newspapers, and published guides advise readers how to find, establish, and manage successful clubs.3\n\nThe widespread popularity of these reading groups has even occasioned a form of ‘book-club backlash.’ In a newspaper opinion piece titled ‘Why I Won’t Join the Book Club,’ one contributor expressed alarm that reading was becoming another scheduled activity to be slotted in ‘like the trip to the gym and the grocery store’; self-improving readers ‘pop’ books as they would vitamin tablets. But books ‘are not about schedules,’ author Stephanie Nolen argues; rather, they are ‘about submerging yourself . . . about getting lost, about getting consumed.’4 Considerable attention was garnered by another article, detailing the darker side of some New York City reading groups. Headlined ‘Book-Club Lovers Wage a War of Words’ when reprinted by the Globe and Mail, it could equally well have been titled ‘When Book Clubs Go Bad’: ‘No longer just friendly social gatherings with a vague continuing-education agenda, many of today’s book groups have become literary pressure cookers, marked by aggressive intellectual oneupmanship and unabashed social skirmishing. In living rooms and bookshops, clubs are frazzling under the stress, giving rise to a whole new profession: the book-group therapist.’5 The clubs that Elaine Daspin describes here seem to be functioning as unconsciousness- rather than consciousness-raising sessions, where competitive readers battle for interpretive supremacy. While book-club therapists may well be confined to the rarefied worlds of the Upper East Side or Long Island, authors of recent book-club guides reiterate the need to establish common purposes, regular routines, and guidelines for thorough preparation.\n\nClearly, the positives outweigh the pitfalls; book clubs are in demand because they offer individual readers an extra dimension of appreciation and understanding. Yet despite the fact that shared discussion of literary texts is also the foundation of literary study in school, college, and university classrooms, literary theorists and reader-response critics have yet to devote much attention to such shared and synergistic study, instead construing readers as isolates or abstractions. (Studies tend to focus on the emotional responses or cognitive activities of individual readers, or to infer such reactions by examining the properties of a literary text.) But club and classroom participants know that there is something different, something added, about sharing and discussing literature with other people.\n\n1 For an example of an online ‘book club’—this one produced by a mass-market circulation women’s magazine—see Conversations (Book Club) on Chateleine Connects at www.canoe.ca/chateleine.\n\n2 For example, Vancouver bookseller Celia Duthie is developing such ‘retreats’ at a country inn. There are discussion periods and visits by authors and, most importantly, time to read. See Keyes, ‘Out of the Woods.’\n\n3 Some popular guides are Greenwood et al., The Go on Girl!; Jacobson, The Reading Group Handbook; and Saal, The New York Public Library Guide to Reading Groups. A new entry to the field, developed with a particular eye to the needs of Canadian clubs, is Heft and O’Brien, Build a Better Book Club.\n\n4 Nolen, ‘Why I Won’t Join the Book Club’\n\n5 Daspin, ‘Book-Club Lovers Wage a War of Words.’ The piece originally appeared in the Wall Street Journal.",
