    "description": "Sui Sin Far, born Edith Maude Eaton, was a well-respected commentator on Chinese-American life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In her famous essay “Leaves from the Mental Portfolio of an Eurasian”(The Independent, 21 January 1909), she asserts that “individuality is more important than nationality.”\n\nFar’s comment is relevant in discussions ranging well beyond those about individuality and nationality. For example, some people argue that identifying oneself as a member of a society or culture is more important than being an individual. Others argue that being true to one’s self carries more weight than being a member of a society or culture.\n\nWrite an essay that argues your position on individuality and nationality.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
