    "description": "Author and lecturer Alfie Kohn contends that “competition by its very nature is always unhealthy.” Read the following excerpt from Kohn’s essay “Why Competition?”\n\nThe cost of any kind of competition in human terms is incalculable. When my success depends on other people’s failure, the prospects for a real human community are considerably diminished. . . . Moreover, when my success depends on my being better than, I am caught on a treadmill, destined never to enjoy real satisfaction. Someone is always one step higher, and even the summit is a precarious position in light of the hordes waiting to occupy it in my stead. I am thus perpetually insecure and, as psychologist Rollo May points out, perpetually anxious.\n\nWrite an essay that argues your position on Kohn’s claim about the nature of competition.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
