    "description": "Carefully read the following passage from Michael J. Sandel’s book Justice: What’s The Right Thing To Do?, published in 2009. \n\n[W]e need a more robust and engaged civic life than the one to which we’ve become accustomed. In recent decades, we’ve come to assume that respecting our fellow citizens’ moral and religious convictions means ignoring them (for political purposes, at least), leaving them undisturbed, and conducting our public life—insofar as possible—without reference to them. But this stance of avoidance can make for a spurious* respect. Often, it means suppressing moral disagreement rather than actually avoiding it. This can provoke backlash and resentment. It can also make for an impoverished public discourse, lurching from one news cycle to the next, preoccupied with the scandalous, the sensational, and the trivial.\n\n*false or fake\n\nWrite an essay that argues your position on Sandel’s claim that for the common good, citizens should openly address moral disagreements on matters of public policy.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
