    "description": "In a 2011 essay in The Atlantic, author and journalist Lori Gottlieb writes: “Nowadays, it’s not enough to be happy — if you can be even happier. The American Dream and the pursuit of happiness have morphed from a quest for general contentment to the idea that you must be happy at all times and in every way.” Gottlieb then cites Barry Schwartz, a professor of social theory: “Happiness as a byproduct of living your life is a great thing . . . [b]ut happiness as a goal is a recipe for disaster.” Write an essay that argues your position on the claim that pursuing happiness as a goal has detrimental effects. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
