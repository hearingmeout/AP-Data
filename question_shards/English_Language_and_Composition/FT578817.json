    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\n(The passage below is excerpted from an essay published in the early twentieth century.)\n\nEvery child has to learn the language he is born to.\n\nIt is certain that he will make mistakes in the process,\n\nespecially as he is not taught it by any wise system,\n\nbut blunders into what usage he can grasp from day\n\n5 to day.\n\nNow, if an adult foreigner were learning our\n\nlanguage, and we greeted his efforts with yells of\n\nlaughter, we should think ourselves grossly rude.\n\nAnd what should we think of ourselves if we further\n\n10 misled him by setting absurd words and phrases\n\nbefore him, encouraging him to further blunders, that\n\nwe might laugh the more; and then, if we had visitors\n\n, inciting him to make these blunders over again to\n\nentertain the company? Yet this is common household\n\n15 sport, so long as there is a little child to act as zany*\n\nfor the amusement of his elders. The errors of a child\n\nare not legitimate grounds of humour, even to those\n\ncoarse enough to laugh at them, any more than a\n\ntoddling baby’s falls have the same elements of the\n\n20 incongruous as the overthrow of a stout old gentleman\n\nwho sits down astonished in the snow.\n\nA baby has to fall. It is natural, and not funny. So\n\ndoes the young child have to make mistakes as he\n\nlearns any or all of the crowding tasks before him; but\n\n25 these are not fair grounds for ridicule.\n\nI was walking in a friend’s garden, and met for the\n\nfirst time the daughter of the house, a tall, beautiful girl\n\nof nineteen or twenty. Her aunt, who was with me, cried\n\nout to her in an affected tone, “Come and\n\n30 meet the lady, Janey!”\n\nThe young girl, who was evidently unpleasantly\n\nimpressed, looked annoyed, and turned aside in some\n\nconfusion, speaking softly to her teacher who was\n\nwith her. Then the aunt, who was a very muscular\n\n35 woman, seized the young lady by her shoulders,\n\nlifted her off the ground, and thrust her blushing, struggling,\n\nand protesting into my arms—by way of introduction!\n\nNaturally enough, the girl was overcome with\n\nmortification, and conceived a violent dislike for me.\n\n40 (This story is exactly true, except that the daughter of\n\nthe house was aged two and a half.)\n\nNow why,—in the name of reason, courtesy,\n\neducation, justice, any lofty and noble consideration,\n\n—why should Two-and-a-half be thus insulted? What\n\n45 is the point of view of the insulter? How does she\n\njustify her brutal behaviour? Is it on the obvious\n\nground of physical superiority in age and strength? It\n\ncannot be that, for we do not gratuitously outrage the\n\nfeelings of all persons younger and smaller than\n\n50 ourselves. A stalwart six-foot septuagenarian does not\n\nthus comport himself toward a small gentleman of\n\nthirty or forty. It cannot be relationship; for such\n\nconduct does not obtain among adults, be they never\n\nso closely allied. It has no basis except that the victim\n\n55 is a child, and the child has no personal rights which\n\nwe feel bound to respect.\n\nA baby, when “good,” is considered as a first-rate\n\nplaything,—a toy to play with or to play on or to set\n\ngoing like a machine-top, that we may laugh at it.\n\n60 There is a legitimate frolicking with small children, as\n\nthe cat plays with her kittens; but that is not in the\n\nleast inconsistent with respect. Grown people can play\n\ntogether and laugh together without jeering at each\n\nother. So we might laugh with our children, even\n\n65 more than we do, and yet never laugh at them.\n\nThe pathetic side of it is that children are even more\n\nsensitive to ridicule than grown people. They have no\n\nphilosophy to fall back upon; and,—here is the\n\nhideously unjust side,—if they lose their tempers,\n\n70 being yet unlearned in self-restraint,—if they try to\n\nturn the tables on their tormentors, then the wise\n\n“grown-up” promptly punishes them for “disrespect.”\n\nThey must respect their elders even in this pitiful\n\nattitude; but who is to demand the respect due to\n\n75 youth?\n\n*a clown or acrobat",
