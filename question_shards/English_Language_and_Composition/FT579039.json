    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\n(The following passage is from a book of essays published in the early 2000s.)\n\nIn attempting an analysis of Lincoln’s humor one is\n\nimmediately confronted with two difficulties. In the first\n\nplace, many stories attributed to Lincoln were never told\n\nby him. A. K. McClure’s Lincoln Stories\n\n5 is recognized as the most reliable collection, yet\n\nIsaac N. Arnold, an intimate friend of Lincoln’s, wrote\n\non the fly-leaf of his copy of this book that Lincoln\n\nprobably told no more than half the stories with\n\nwhich McClure credited him.1 To prove that\n\n10 Lincoln did or did not tell a particular story is often\n\nimpossible, for in most cases one must rely upon\n\nhearsay evidence or reminiscences.\n\nThe second difficulty lies in the fact that the\n\neffectiveness of a joke depends in large measure upon\n\n15 the manner of its telling. We may not be at all amused\n\nby reading some of Lincoln’s jokes or hearing them at\n\nsecondhand; whereas we might have split our sides\n\nhad we heard them as he told them. For Lincoln was\n\na master of the story-telling art; and when told by a\n\n20 master, even a dull joke may be irresistible.\n\n“His stories may be literally retold,” wrote\n\nHenry C. Whitney, “every word, period and comma,\n\nbut the real humor perished with Lincoln”; for\n\n“he provoked as much laughter by the grotesque\n\n25 expression of his homely face as by the abstract\n\nfun of his stories.”2\n\nHis manner of recital, declared Judge David Davis,\n\nwas “in many respects unique, if not remarkable.3 His\n\ncountenance and all his features seemed to take part in\n\n30 the performance. As he neared the pith or point of the\n\njoke or story every vestige of seriousness disappeared\n\nfrom his face. His little gray eyes sparkled; a smile seemed\n\nto gather up, curtain-like, the corners of his mouth;\n\nhis frame quivered with suppressed\n\n35 excitement; and when the point—or ‘nub’ of the\n\nstory, as he called it—came, no one’s laugh was\n\nheartier than his.”4\n\nHis humor had a general appeal. Not only the\n\ncircuit lawyers and the Western villagers and farmers,\n\n40 but even urbane Easterners readily succumbed to it.\n\nIn 1842, Ex-President [Martin] Van Buren, making\n\na tour of the West, stopped one night at the village of\n\nRochester, a few miles from Springfield. The Democratic\n\npoliticians of Springfield went out “en\n\n45 masse” to meet and entertain him, taking Lincoln and\n\na few other Whigs along. Van Buren related several\n\namusing incidents of New York politics, while others\n\ntold tales of early life on the frontier. But all yielded\n\nat last to Lincoln, who kept them in an uproar far into\n\n50 the night with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of\n\nyarns, until Van Buren insisted that “his sides were\n\nsore with laughing.”5\n\nIn many cases the stories Lincoln told were not\n\noriginal, although he often embellished and improved\n\n55 them. He himself repeatedly disclaimed credit for\n\nauthorship and described himself as merely a retail\n\ndealer. His proficiency lay rather in a retentive memory,\n\nan uncanny power of association and\n\nhistrionic skill.6 “He did not forget the good things\n\n60 that he heard,” wrote Charles Sumner, “and was never\n\nwithout a familiar story to illustrate his meaning.\n\nWhen he spoke, the recent West seemed to vie with\n\nthe ancient East in apologue and fable. His ideas moved,\n\nas the beasts entered Noah’s ark, in pairs. At\n\n65 times his illustrations had a homely felicity, and with him\n\nthey seemed to be not less important than the argument,\n\nwhich he always enforced with a certain\n\nintensity of manner and voice.”7\n\nMuch of Lincoln’s success as a storyteller was due\n\n70 to a talent for mimicry. “In the role of storyteller,”\n\nsaid T. G. Onstot, son of the New Salem cooper, “I\n\nnever knew his equal. His power of mimicry was very\n\ngreat.”8\n\n1 Alexander K. McClure, Lincoln’s Yarns and Stories (Chicago: John C. Winston, 1904). Far more trustworthy and scholarly is Paul M. Zall, ed., Abe Lincoln Laughing: Humorous Anecdotes from Original Sources by and about Abraham Lincoln (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982).\n\n2 Henry C. Whitney, Life on the Circuit with Lincoln, ed. Paul M. Angle (Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton, 1940), 174.\n\n3 In 1836, Maryland-born David Davis (1815-86) settled in Bloomington, Illinois. A close friend of Lincoln, he served as judge of the Eighth Circuit from 1848 to 1862, when Lincoln named him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n4 Paul M. Angle, ed., Herndon’s Life of Lincoln: The History and Personal Recollections of Abraham Lincoln as Originally Written by William H. Herndon and\n\nJesse W. Weik (Cleveland: World, 1942), 250. This reminiscence of Lincoln’s story-telling is by Herndon, not Davis.\n\n5 Angle, ed., Herndon’s Lincoln, 208.\n\n6 Thomas’s note: Lincoln’s skill as a raconteur may have been to some extent hereditary. “From his father came that knack of story-telling, which has made him so delightful among acquaintances, and so irresistible in his stump and forensic drolleries,” wrote William Dean Howells in his campaign biography of Lincoln. And Lincoln, when he corrected a copy of this book for his friend Samuel C. Parks, “let the statement stand.” Editor’s note: W. D. Howells, Life of Abraham Lincoln (Springfield: Abraham Lincoln Association, 1938), 20. Samuel C. Parks of Springfield was a friend of Lincoln’s. In 1863 he became an associate justice of the Idaho Supreme Court. His copy of Howells’s biography, complete with Lincoln’s penciled corrections, is reproduced in facsimile in this edition.\n\n7 Charles Sumner, “Eulogy,” in A Memorial of Abraham Lincoln (Boston: City Council, 1865), 134.\n\n8 Thompson Gaines Onstot (b. 1829), author of Pioneers of Menard and Mason Counties (Forest City, Ill.: Onstot, 1902), was the son of Henry Onstot.",
