    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers. (The following passage is excerpted from a recent book about the United States Declaration of Independence.) When one undertakes to read any text— whether fiction or nonfiction or even a poem— a handful of tried-and-true questions set one going in the right direction: What kind of text have I got in front of me? 5 Who is the audience for this text? And what is the structure of the text— that is, how has the author divided the text into parts? How do those parts help accomplish what the whole has been crafted to do? Asking these questions about the Declaration will 10 make us better readers of its democratic art. I’ll start with the first: what kind of text is the Declaration? Is it a sacred text? Or a treatise? Or perhaps a law? This is a question we rarely ask. 15 In fact, the Declaration is just an ordinary memo. As an example, I have in mind a memo I saw recently from a dean of students office at a northeastern college. It announced that, going forward, the dining hall would stay open later on weekdays, and it offered 20 reasons for that change. The Declaration is the same kind of document: a memo that announces and, thereby, brings about a change, while also explaining it. Short for “memorandum,” which is Latin for 25 “something that needs to be remembered,” the memo has been a basic tool of human social organization ever since writing was invented. Although we are used to thinking of memos these days mainly as interoffice directives, our view has become restricted. 30 Here’s an older and more fundamental meaning: An informal diplomatic message, esp. one summarizing the state of a question, justifying a decision, or recommending a course of action. In fact, its oldest usage spawned a formula to 35 launch declarations. It went like this: Memorandum, That it is hereby declared . . . As ever speedier modes of duplication and communication have emerged, memos have become only more common and more important. Those 40 who write the best memos set policy for businesses, cultural organizations, and governments. Because of their impact on our memories, writers rule. They wield the instrument by which our world is organized. The Declaration, too, is a very practical document. 45 It claims to know something about how a particular institution of a particular kind— the kingdom of Great Britain, a free and independent state— should work. It criticizes this institution for failing to work as it should. It announces the separation, on account of 50 this failure, of the colonies from Britain and the coming into being of a new political system. But it also had the job of organizing a group to joint action: revolt from Britain. What does it take for a group to act in concert? 55 How are decisions made? Who takes responsibility for them? What makes it possible for a group, organization, or institution to collaborate over time? When do they run into trouble? Why? We all know things about how institutions should work. By trying 60 to answer questions like these in relation to our own lives, we build a context for thinking about the Declaration.",
