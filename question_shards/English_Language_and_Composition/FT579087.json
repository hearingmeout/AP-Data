    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\n(The following passage is excerpted from a recent book about the United States Declaration of Independence.)\n\nWhen one undertakes to read any text— whether\n\nfiction or nonfiction or even a poem— a handful of\n\ntried-and-true questions set one going in the right\n\ndirection: What kind of text have I got in front of me?\n\n5 Who is the audience for this text? And what is the\n\nstructure of the text— that is, how has the author\n\ndivided the text into parts? How do those parts help\n\naccomplish what the whole has been crafted to do?\n\nAsking these questions about the Declaration will\n\n10 make us better readers of its democratic art.\n\nI’ll start with the first: what kind of text is the\n\nDeclaration?\n\nIs it a sacred text? Or a treatise? Or perhaps a law?\n\nThis is a question we rarely ask.\n\n15 In fact, the Declaration is just an ordinary memo.\n\nAs an example, I have in mind a memo I saw recently from\n\na dean of students office at a northeastern college. It\n\nannounced that, going forward, the dining hall would stay\n\nopen later on weekdays, and it offered\n\n20 reasons for that change. The Declaration is the same kind\n\nof document: a memo that announces and, thereby, brings\n\nabout a change, while also\n\nexplaining it.\n\nShort for “memorandum,” which is Latin for\n\n25 “something that needs to be remembered,” the\n\nmemo has been a basic tool of human social organization\n\never since writing was invented. Although we are used to\n\nthinking of memos these days mainly as interoffice directives,\n\nour view has become restricted.\n\n30 Here’s an older and more fundamental meaning:\n\nAn informal diplomatic message, esp. one summarizing\n\nthe state of a question, justifying a decision, or\n\nrecommending a course of action.\n\nIn fact, its oldest usage spawned a formula to\n\n35 launch declarations. It went like this: Memorandum, \n\nThat it is hereby declared . . .\n\nAs ever speedier modes of duplication and\n\ncommunication have emerged, memos have become only\n\nmore common and more important. Those\n\n40 who write the best memos set policy for businesses,\n\ncultural organizations, and governments. Because of their\n\nimpact on our memories, writers rule. They wield the instrument\n\nby which our world is organized.\n\nThe Declaration, too, is a very practical document.\n\n45 It claims to know something about how a particular\n\ninstitution of a particular kind— the kingdom of Great Britain,\n\na free and independent state— should\n\nwork. It criticizes this institution for failing to work as it should.\n\nIt announces the separation, on account of\n\n50 this failure, of the colonies from Britain and the\n\ncoming into being of a new political system. But it\n\nalso had the job of organizing a group to joint action:\n\nrevolt from Britain.\n\nWhat does it take for a group to act in concert?\n\n55 How are decisions made? Who takes responsibility\n\nfor them? What makes it possible for a group,\n\norganization, or institution to collaborate over time?\n\nWhen do they run into trouble? Why? We all know\n\nthings about how institutions should work. By trying\n\n60 to answer questions like these in relation to our own\n\nlives, we build a context for thinking about the\n\nDeclaration.",
