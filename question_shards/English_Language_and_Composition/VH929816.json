    "description": "Truisms are statements presented as facts that are supposed to be self-evident or understood through common sense. Some truisms, such as Yogi Berra’s quip that “You can observe a lot by watching,” seem quite true. Other truisms, however, such as “A penny saved is a penny earned,” may no longer be as valid today as they once were.\n\nIdentify a truism that you have heard or read many times.\n\nCompose a thesis statement arguing your position on the extent to which the truism you identified is valid.\n\nIdentify two pieces of evidence to support your position. Then, explain how each piece of evidence might be used to develop your argument.",
