    "description": "In her 1962 Book of Common Sense Etiquette, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, “True patriotism springs from a belief in the dignity of the individual, freedom and equality not only for Americans but for all people on earth, universal brotherhood and good will, and a constant striving toward the principles and ideals on which this country was founded.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Roosevelt’s claim about patriotism is valid. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
