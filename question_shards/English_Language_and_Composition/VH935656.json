You belong in a community where you can be what you long to be, a place that keeps reminding you that you have a soul.”\n\nWrite an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Alvarez’s claim about community is valid.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
