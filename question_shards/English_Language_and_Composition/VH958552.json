    "description": "In the following passage from the essay “The Talented Tenth” (1903), American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois spends time defining what the purpose of education is not. Read the passage carefully. Then write an essay that argues your position on what the true purpose of education should be.\n\n[T]he training of men is a difficult and intricate task. Its technique is a matter for educational experts, but its object is for the vision of seers. If we make money the object of man-training, we shall develop money-makers but not necessarily men; if we make technical skill the object of education, we may possess artisans but not, in nature, men.\n\nIn your response you should do the following: \n\n·         Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.  \n\n·         Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. \n\n·         Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.  \n\n·         Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
