    "description": "(The passage below is a draft.)\n\n(1) After an unsuccessful search, NASA determined that instead of following a trajectory that would allow the Orbiter to enter orbit around Mars, it came too close to the planet, causing it to enter and disintegrate in Mars’s atmosphere. (2) The culprit was a discrepancy in the software that controlled the spacecraft’s thrusters: one team of engineers had calculated the force needed from the thrusters in pounds, an imperial unit, while another team calculated the force in newtons, a metric unit.\n(3) The Orbiter mission failure is just one reason, albeit an extremely expensive one, that the United States needs to abandon future Mars survey missions. (4) Most of the world uses the metric system, a decimal measurement system that allows for simple scaling and calculations by adding the relevant prefixes: one kilometer, for example, is 1,000 meters, and one kilogram is 1,000 grams. (5) The imperial measurement system used in the United States assigns values haphazardly: one mile is 5,280 feet long, while one pound is 16 ounces.\n(6) The United States is one of only three countries—the others are Liberia and Myanmar—that have not fully adopted the metric system. (7) Not only are conversion errors such as the Orbiter one costly, they can be deadly. (8) Wrong dosing of medicine due to unit confusion (teaspoons versus milliliters) results in trips to the emergency room each year. (9) Switching to the metric system would also benefit United States industries; the European Union, for example, has been requiring its member states to standardize their metric systems since 1971.\n(10) Converting to metric may seem difficult, but the United States already uses it more than you might think, from races (that 5K you’re running) to soft drinks (that 2-liter bottle you bought) to high school science classes (those 250-milliliter beakers you used in chemistry). (11) It’s time for the United States to make the leap to metric in everything else it measures.",
