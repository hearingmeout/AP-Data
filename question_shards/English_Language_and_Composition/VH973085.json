    "description": "The following excerpt is from researcher Erin Bryant’s “Real Lies, White Lies and Gray Lies: Towards a Typology of Deception” (2008). Read the excerpt carefully. Then write an essay that argues your position on the circumstances—if any—under which lying should be considered acceptable.\n\nTo group all lying into one category is misleading. . . . Some lies . . . are trivial and may even prevent someone from being hurt by an unnecessary truth. These harmless white lies have been called a communication competence or “social lubricant” because they allow people to censor negative thoughts and truths.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a claim that establishes a line of reasoning.\n\nSelect and use evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain the relationship between the evidence and your thesis.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
