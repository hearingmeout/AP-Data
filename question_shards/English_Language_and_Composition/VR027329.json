    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe passage below is a draft.\n\n(1) Since its emergence as a genre, science fiction literature has shown readers visions of the future. (2) These fictional scenarios have sometimes become reality. (3) As a result, some readers and critics see forecasting technological and social developments as science fiction’s essential goal. (4) However, science fiction’s purpose lies not in predicting the future but in providing perspective on the present.\n\n(5) In Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), which many critics consider the first science fiction novel, the scientist Victor Frankenstein creates a new form of human life, only to find his creation hideous and regret his actions. (6) Although Shelley’s novel is sometimes invoked when biological research takes an ethically controversial turn, the novel itself does not try to anticipate the real scientific or technological developments that followed it. (7) Instead, it reflects the concerns of Shelley and her contemporaries about the consequences of unchecked technological development in the Industrial Revolution, such as pollution and the loss of traditional ways of life.\n\n(8) Richard Morgan’s Altered Carbon (2002), which depicts a world in which wealthy elites extend their lives indefinitely by uploading their consciousness into new bodies, expresses anxieties about modern society in a similar way. (9) Uploaded consciousness also facilitates interstellar travel in the novel. (10) Rather, the futuristic plot allows Morgan to articulate contemporary concerns about social inequality and its relationship to access to technology.\n\n(11) Ultimately, the real role of science fiction is to hold a distorted mirror up to contemporary life, exposing what is familiar to a critical eye.",
