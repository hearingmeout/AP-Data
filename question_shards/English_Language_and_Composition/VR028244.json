The writer drafted the following thesis statement, which is intended to preview the line of reasoning the new passage would have.",
    "question": "Though it is true that Tyler studied six separate works of art, including such famous works as Vitruvian Man and Salvator Mundi, there is not enough evidence to prove that da Vinci suffered from exotropia. Should the writer include the underlined portion of the thesis statement?",
