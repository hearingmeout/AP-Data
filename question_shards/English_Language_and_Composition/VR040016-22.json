    "description": "The term “overrated” is often used to diminish concepts, places, roles, etc. that the speaker believes do not deserve the prestige they commonly enjoy; for example, many writers have argued that success is overrated, a character in a novel by Anthony Burgess famously describes Rome as a “vastly overrated city,” and Queen Rania of Jordan herself has asserted that “[b]eing queen is overrated.”\n\nSelect a concept, place, role, etc. to which you believe that the term “overrated” should be applied. Write an essay that argues your position.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
