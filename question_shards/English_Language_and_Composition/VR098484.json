    "description": "Read the following carefully before choosing your answers. The passage below is a draft. (1) From Toronto, Canada, to Songdo, South Korea, cities around the world are promoting themselves as “smart cities.” (2) Smart-city initiatives cover a remarkable range of public infrastructure, including waste receptacles that signal when they need to be emptied, systems that broadcast locations of available communal bicycles, and electricity grids that distribute energy in response to usage patterns. (3) Many people are excited about these new technologies, and, as civil engineering professor and infrastructure expert Shoshanna Saxe explains, they are intended to improve infrastructure by collecting data and responding automatically. (4) As Saxe and other urbanists have argued, however, that premise should be questioned. (5) Adding sensors for data collection to public services such as water and electricity distribution introduces new vulnerability to urban infrastructure. (6) Saxe and other experienced city planners worry that networked digital infrastructure would be more akin to a smartphone or computer. (7) Although smart infrastructure promises more efficient delivery of services and may deliver on that promise in the beginning, it is susceptible to failure in ways that conventional infrastructure is not.",
