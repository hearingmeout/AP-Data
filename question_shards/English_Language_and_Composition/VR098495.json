(3) Many people are excited about these new technologies, and, as civil engineering professor and infrastructure expert Shoshanna Saxe explains, they are intended to improve infrastructure by collecting data and responding automatically. (4) As Saxe and other urbanists have argued, however, that premise should be questioned.\n\n(5) Adding sensors for data collection to public services such as water and electricity distribution introduces new vulnerability to urban infrastructure. (6) Saxe and other experienced city planners worry that networked digital infrastructure would be more akin to a smartphone or computer.
