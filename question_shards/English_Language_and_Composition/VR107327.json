    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe passage below is a draft.\n\n(1) Many people living near the Mississippi River see mayflies as a nuisance. (2) The mayflies’ sudden entrance to life in the air, their languid flying and resting on objects at their convenience, and their deaths seemed a bother to humans.\n\n(3) Adult mayflies’ short lifespans are at the heart of the problem. (4) Throughout a couple of weeks each summer, the nymphs (juvenile mayflies), which have developed underwater for the past few months, hatch into millions of mature mayflies with nonfunctioning mouths. (5) These adult mayflies mate, lay eggs on and near the water, and then die within a day or two, sometimes in piles multiple feet high that create treacherous driving conditions for humans. (6) These perishing insects impact nondriving humans as well by collecting on air conditioner compressors and the like, often preventing them from functioning. (7) In fact, often street lights are shut off in order to decrease the number of mayflies congregating near them. (8) And, believe it or not, the wings and skin of mayflies cause an allergic reaction on the skin of some folk. (9) The bodies of these mayflies are long and thin and support large wings.\n\n(10) Despite these nuisances, I have come to value these somewhat unsightly creatures. (11) For example, because they need clean water to survive, their presence indicates to humans the health of a body of fresh water. (12) In fact, they have been used to assess the quality of water in fresh water areas. (13) In addition, the nymphs, with their functioning mouths, contribute to the cleanliness of the water by eating algae and decaying vegetation. (14 Therefore, they are important indicators of the health of a human’s environment. (15) Moreover, clean bodies of fresh water attract human recreational activity. (16) Mayflies impact the economies of humans who live near healthy rivers and lakes—both tourists and locals spend money to enjoy activities in and near the water.",
