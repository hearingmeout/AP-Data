    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers. The passage below is a draft. (1) Popularized by movies and TV shows such as Tiny House Nation, the tiny house movement advocates for more people to live in small homes—typically measuring less than 500 square feet at a time when the average new home in the United States is 2,600 square feet—that efficiently use their limited space. (2) According to fanatical tiny house proponents, these houses’ mobility (many tiny houses have wheels and can be moved with a truck), small space requirements, and minimal carbon footprint provide a way to address environmental problems and the rising cost of living in cities. (3) However, while the tiny house trend appears to be beneficial on several levels, in reality it is not a practical way to deal with these issues. (4) One of the most important appeals of tiny houses is their low price. (5) Ranging from $22,000 to $79,000, the prices of tiny houses are far lower than those of new traditional houses, which had a median price of over $300,000 in 2018. (6) According to the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, the total value of housing in the United States is $27.2 trillion. (7) However, advocates often fail to consider the hidden cost of tiny homes: the land they sit on. (8) In many areas, purchasing or renting land for a tiny home requires compliance with local building codes. (9) And many cities do not welcome tiny homes. (10) In some cases, tiny homes do not meet zoning regulations; in others residents fear tiny homes will decrease property values of neighboring houses. (11) Another touted benefit of tiny homes is that they are a “greener” housing alternative, but again the reality is more complicated. (12) While tiny houses are more energy efficient than larger buildings, the average size of a house—and the associated energy consumption—varies considerably from one country to another. (13) Although many people see tiny homes as an appealing solution to pressing housing problems, cities that are most pressed for space already have a solution that works better: apartment complexes and other efficient, eco-friendly forms of dense housing.",
