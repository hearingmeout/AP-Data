    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe passage below is a draft.\n\n(1) While scientists are discovering titanosaur bones all over the world with remarkable frequency, according to paleontologist Kristina Curry Rogers, “the earliest phases of [the titanosaur] take over are still pretty mysterious.” (2) Now, however, paleontologists have undoubtedly uncovered the key piece in the puzzle with the announcement of a new dinosaur discovery in Tanzania: a titanosaur dubbed the Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia. (3) The specimen unearthed by the scientists lived between 110 and 100 million years ago, meaning that the species was an early member of the titanosaur group. (4) By studying this new dinosaur, paleontologists believe they can determine the precise function of its mysteriously heart-shaped tail bones.\n\n(5) The announcement in February 2019 created a great buzz in both the scientific community and the general public. (6) This excitement was in part because of a unique feature: the titanosaur’s heart-shaped tail bones. (7) Indeed, the dinosaur’s name, Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia, comes from the Swahili for “animal of the Mtuka with a heart-shaped tail.” (8) Eric Gorscak, the paleontologist who led the excavation, described the long process involved in unearthing the titanosaur fossils from the Mtuka riverbed in Tanzania, a complicated endeavor that required excavators to scale a cliff wall with climbing gear. (9) Gorscak’s team knew they had found a new species thanks to the weird tail bones, as well as specific neck and chest bones. (10) As for the function of the heart-shaped tail bones, Patrick O’Connor, a coauthor on the study, theorizes that they might have allowed the titanosaur to stiffen its long tail.\n\n(11) The location of the dinosaur find, however, excited scientists even more than the distinctive tail bones. (12) Until recently, most titanosaur fossil discoveries have been in South America. (13) Hence, this new discovery of an early titanosaur species in Tanzania “provides a critical look at the group before the widespread diversification around the planet,” says O’Connor. (14) And while titanosaurs were one of the most domineering groups during the age of dinosaurs, says Gorscak, “their early evolutionary history remains obscure, and Mnyamawamtuka helps reveal those beginnings.” (15) Gorscak plans additional fossil digs in other parts of Africa, hoping to find other critical pieces of the Cretaceous titanosaur puzzle.",
