        "text": "In the introduction to his 2014 book about culture in the United States, critic Jeff Chang, who has written on popular culture, politics, music, and the arts, argued: “Every moment of major social change requires a collective leap of imagination.

Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
