    "description": "(The passage below is a draft.)\n\n(1) Given their growing popularity, many people are convinced that emojis are or will become a genuine, independent language. (2) However, while emojis have a growing—and perhaps indispensable—role in modern communication, they will never become a language of their own.\n(3) Some people have actually tried to force emojis to act as a language. (4) In fact, graphic designer Joe Hale went so far as to “translate” all of Alice in Wonderland into emojis. (5) The fact that one needs to “read” Hale’s version alongside the printed text of the original, however, demonstrates the fact that emojis simply do not function in the same way words do. (6) Instead, emojis are icons that, as linguist Vyvyan Evans points out, “do not constitute a language because they do not have a grammar that allows them to be combined into more complex units of meaning.”\n(7) The power of emojis, and the likely reason for their popularity, is that they add context and nuance to written communication. (8) When we are speaking to other people, according to Evans, “70% of the meaning . . . comes from non-verbal cues.” (9) Those cues (inflection and tone, body language, facial expressions, etc.) are not available in written communications, which can lead to misunderstandings. (10) Emojis were invented to minimize those misunderstandings, and as e-mails, text messages, and social media posts have become more and more common, the implementation of emojis has gone through the roof. (11) Even in 2015 there were already 6 billion emojis sent in text messages every day.\n(12) As we communicate more using our computers and phones, we are likely to see more emojis, though the list of fun facts on guesstheemoji.org reminds us that emojis are not the same as emoticons. (13) They still play an important role in fostering clear and nuanced communication.",
