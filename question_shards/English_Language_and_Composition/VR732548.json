    "description": "Following the dismantling of apartheid—a government-sponsored system of racial segregation and discrimination—in South Africa, the nation’s first inclusive, multiracial general election was held in April 1994. After serving 27 years in prison for his efforts to end apartheid, activist Nelson Mandela was elected as South Africa’s first Black president. The following passage is an excerpt from the speech Mandela delivered at his presidential inauguration on May 10, 1994. Read the passage carefully. Write an essay that analyzes the rhetorical choices Mandela makes to achieve his purpose of both acknowledging the significance of the election and setting the tone for his administration.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nOut of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.\n\nOur daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity’s belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.\n\nAll this we owe both to ourselves and to the peoples of the world who are so well represented here today.\n\nTo my compatriots, I have no hesitation in saying that each one of us is as intimately attached to the soil of this beautiful country as are the famous jacaranda trees of Pretoria and the mimosa trees of the bushveld.\n\nEach time one of us touches the soil of this land, we feel a sense of personal renewal. The national mood changes as the seasons change.\n\nWe are moved by a sense of joy and exhilaration when the grass turns green and the flowers bloom.\n\nThat spiritual and physical oneness we all share with this common homeland explains the depth of the pain we all carried in our hearts as we saw our country tear itself apart in a terrible conflict, and as we saw it spurned, outlawed and isolated by the peoples of the world, precisely because it has become the universal base of the pernicious ideology and practice of racism and racial oppression.\n\nWe, the people of South Africa, feel fulfilled that humanity has taken us back into its bosom, that we, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our own soil.\n\nWe thank all our distinguished international guests for having come to take possession with the people of our country of what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity.\n\nWe trust that you will continue to stand by us as we tackle the challenges of building peace, prosperity, non-sexism, non-racialism and democracy.\n\nWe deeply appreciate the role that the masses of our people and their political mass democratic, religious, women, youth, business, traditional and other leaders have played to bring about this conclusion. Not least among them is my Second Deputy President, the Honourable F. W. de Klerk.\n\nWe would also like to pay tribute to our security forces, in all their ranks, for the distinguished role they have played in securing our first democratic elections and the transition to democracy, from blood-thirsty forces which still refuse to see the light.\n\nThe time for the healing of the wounds has come.\n\nThe moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come.\n\nThe time to build is upon us.\n\nWe have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.\n\nWe succeeded to take our last steps to freedom in conditions of relative peace. We commit ourselves to the construction of a complete, just and lasting peace.\n\nWe have triumphed in the effort to implant hope in the breasts of the millions of our people. We enter into a covenant that we shall build the society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without any fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity—a rainbow nation1term coined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to refer to a multicultural post-apartheid South Africa at peace with itself and the world.\n\nAs a token of its commitment to the renewal of our country, the new Interim Government of National Unity will, as a matter of urgency, address the issue of amnesty for various categories of our people who are currently serving terms of imprisonment.\n\nWe dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroines in this country and the rest of the world who sacrificed in many ways and surrendered their lives so that we could be free.\n\nTheir dreams have become reality. Freedom is their reward.\n\nWe are both humbled and elevated by the honour and privilege that you, the people of South Africa, have bestowed on us, as the first President of a united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South Africa, to lead our country out of the valley of darkness.\n\nWe understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom.\n\nWe know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success.\n\nWe must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world.\n\nLet there be justice for all.\n\nLet there be peace for all.\n\nLet there be work, bread, water and salt for all.\n\nLet each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves.",
