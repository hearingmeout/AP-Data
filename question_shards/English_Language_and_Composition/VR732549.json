        "text": "In a 1993 speech to the United States House of Representatives, Bette Bao Lord, a writer and human rights activist, stated: “[N]o man or woman has ever aspired to be a pawn.1a person used or manipulated by others for their own purposes On the contrary, regardless of culture and history, everyone yearns to be the master of his or her own fate.” Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Lord’s claim about people’s desire to be in control of their own lives is valid. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.",
