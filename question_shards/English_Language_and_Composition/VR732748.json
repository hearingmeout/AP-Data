    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\n(The following passage is a draft.)\n\n(1) As an undergraduate, Wanda Díaz-Merced hoped to become an astronomer, for when she was gradually losing her eyesight, she had doubts about entering a field that relies heavily on visual data. (2) However, after listening to live audio of an astronomical event, Díaz-Merced realized that information does not necessarily have to be conveyed by visual means. (3) By using sonification—a method that translates visual data into nonspeech sound values—Díaz-Merced has achieved her dream of becoming an astronomer.\n\n(4) In 2005, Díaz-Merced began developing software that uses sonification to analyze large sets of astronomical data. (5) With this software, visible features—brightness, for instance—are mapped using audible elements that include rhythm, duration, volume, and pitch. (6) Then, to evaluate the software, she conducted a simulation in which a group of experienced astronomers used either visual data, sonified data, or a combination of the two to detect a galactic black hole. (7) It was an unusual experiment: sonification helped the researchers better identify the indicators of black holes.\n\n(8) As Díaz-Merced’s research has shown, sonification is useful for many people, not just those who are unable to work with visual data. (9) By listening, scientists can detect patterns that may not be evident from looking at visual data because “sensitivity to events increases when you use sound.” (10) Through her efforts, the method has gained acceptance in the scientific community. (11) NASA has translated data from several of its space endeavors into sound, and a 2020 study concluded that sonification can also help scientists share their results with nonexperts.\n\n(12) Díaz-Merced has become one of the foremost advocates for the use of sonification and increasing accessibility in the sciences. (13) Commenting on her groundbreaking work, she said, “When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits, that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life. And I think that the use of sound in astronomy is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.”",
