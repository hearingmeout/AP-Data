    "question": "In a speech delivered in 1883, social reformer and writer Frederick Douglass asserted that “No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man, without at last finding the other end of it fastened about his own neck.” When attempting to control someone or something, do people compromise their own freedom in the process? Carefully consider the implications of Douglass’s assertion. Compose a thesis statement that you might use for an essay arguing your position on the validity of Douglass’s assertion, then provide bullet lines of reasoning with brief references to evidence from your reading, experience, or observation.",
