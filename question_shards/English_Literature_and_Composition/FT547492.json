    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Their Lonely Betters As I listened from a beach-chair in the shade To all the noises that my garden made, It seemed to me only proper that words Should be withheld from vegetables and birds. (5) A robin with no Christian name ran through The Robin-Anthem which was all it knew, And rustling flowers for some third party waited To say which pairs, if any, should get mated. Not one of them was capable of lying, (10) There was not one which knew that it was dying Or could have with a rhythm or a rhyme Assumed responsibility for time. Let them leave language to their lonely betters Who count some days and long for certain letters; (15) We, too, make noises when we laugh or weep: Words are for those with promises to keep. “Their Lonely Betters,” copyright 1951 by W. H. Auden, renewed 19 79 by The Estate of W. H. Auden, from Collected Poems of W. H. Auden by W. H. Auden. Used by permission of Random House, Inc. and Curtis Brown, Ltd.",
