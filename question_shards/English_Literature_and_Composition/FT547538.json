    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. To the Same Flower1 With little here to do or see Of things that in the great world be, Daisy! again I talk to thee, For thou art worthy, (5) Thou unassuming Common-place Of Nature, with that homely face, And yet with something of a grace, Which Love makes for thee! Oft on the dappled turf at ease (10) I sit, and play with similes, Loose types of things through all degrees, Thoughts of thy raising: And many a fond and idle name I give to thee, for praise or blame, (15) As is the humour of the game, While I am gazing. A nun demure of lowly port; Or sprightly maiden, of Love’s court, In thy simplicity the sport (20) Of all temptations; A queen in crown of rubies drest; A starveling in a scanty vest; Are all, as seems to suit thee best, Thy appellations. (25) A little cyclops, with one eye Staring to threaten and defy, That thought comes next—and instantly The freak2 is over, The shape will vanish—and behold (30) A silver shield with boss of gold, That spreads itself, some faery bold In fight to cover! I see thee glittering from afar— And then thou art a pretty star; (35) Not quite so fair as many are In heaven above thee! Yet like a star, with glittering crest, Self-poised in air thou seem’st to rest;— May peace come never to his nest, (40) Who shall reprove thee! Bright Flower! for by that name at last, When all my reveries are past, I call thee, and to that cleave fast, Sweet silent creature! (45) That breath’st with me in sun and air, Do thou, as thou art wont, repair My heart with gladness, and a share Of thy meek nature! (1807) 1 This poem is part of a series of three daisy poems, each of which is sometimes published with the title “To the Daisy.” 2 whim",
