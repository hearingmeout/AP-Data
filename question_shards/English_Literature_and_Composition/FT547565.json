    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The Fair Singer To make a final conquest of all me, Love did compose so sweet an enemy, In whom both beauties to my death agree, Joining themselves in fatal harmony; (5) That while she with her eyes my heart does bind, She with her voice might captivate my mind. I could have fled from one but singly fair: My disentangled soul itself might save, Breaking the curlèd trammels of her hair. (10) But how should I avoid to be her slave, Whose subtle art invisibly can wreathe My fetters of the very air I breathe? It had been easy fighting in some plain, Where victory might hang in equal choice, (15) Who has th’ advantage both of eyes and voice, But all resistance against her is vain, And all my forces needs must be undone, She having gainèd both the wind and sun.
