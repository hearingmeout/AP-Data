    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. A January Dandelion All Nashville is a-chill! And everywhere, As wind-swept sands upon the deserts blow, There is, each moment, sifted through the air A powered blast of January snow. 5O thoughtless dandelion! to be misled By a few warm days to leave thy natural bed Was folly growth and blooming over soon. And yet, thou blasted, yellow-coated gem! Full many hearts have but a common boon 10With thee, now freezing on thy slender stem. When once the heart-blooms by love’s fervid breath Is left, and chilling snow is sifted in, It still may beat, but there is blast and death To all that blooming life that might have been. (1916)",
