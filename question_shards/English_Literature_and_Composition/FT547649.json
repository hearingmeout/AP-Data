    "description": "Read the following excerpt carefully before you choose your answers. A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.* There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking largely sobers us again. (5) Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts, In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts, While from the bounded level of our mind Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind; But more advanced, behold with strange surprise (10) New distant scenes of endless science rise! So pleased at first the towering Alps we try, Mount o’er the vales, and seem to tread the sky, Th’ eternal snows appear already past, And the first clouds and mountains seem the last; (15) But, those attained, we tremble to survey The growing labors of the lengthened way, Th’ increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes, Hills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise! A perfect judge will read each work of wit (20) With the same spirit that its author writ: Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind; Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight, The generous pleasure to be charmed with wit. (25) But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow, Correctly cold, and regularly low, That shunning faults, one quiet tenor keep, We cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep. In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts (30) Is not th’ exactness of peculiar parts; ‘Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call, But the joint force and full result of all. Thus when we view some well-proportioned dome, (The world’s just wonder, and even thine, O Rome!) No single parts unequally surprise, All comes united to th’ admiring eyes; No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear; The whole at once is bold, and regular. Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see, (40) Thinks what ne’er was, nor is, nor e’er shall be. In every work regard the writer’s end, Since none can compass more than they intend; And if the means be just, the conduct true, Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due; (45) As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit, T’ avoid great errors, must the less commit: Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays, For not to know some trifles, is a praise. Most critics, fond of some subservient art, (50) Still make the whole depend upon a part: They talk of principles, but notions prize, And all to one loved folly sacrifice. (1711) * a spring sacred to the Muses",
