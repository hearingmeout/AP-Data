    "description": "Read the following excerpt carefully before you choose your answers. Yonder’s a work now, of that famous youth The Urbinate1 who died five years ago. (’Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) Well, I can fancy how he did it all, (5) Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, Above and through his art—for it gives way; That arm is wrongly put—and there again— A fault to pardon in the drawing’s lines, (10) Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, He means right—that, a child may understand. Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: But all the play, the insight and the stretch— Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? (15) Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think— More than I merit, yes, by many times. But had you—oh, with the same perfect brow, (20) And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird The fowler’s pipe, and follows to the snare— Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged (25) “God and the glory! never care for gain. The present by the future, what is that? Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!2 Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!” I might have done it for you. So it seems: (30) Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. Beside, incentives come from the soul’s self; The rest avail not. Why do I need you? What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? In this world, who can do a thing, will not; (35) And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: Yet the will’s somewhat—somewhat, too, the power— And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. ’Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, (40) That I am something underrated here, Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. [. . .] If you would sit thus by me every night I should work better, do you comprehend? I mean that I should earn more, give you more. (45) See, it is settled dusk now; there’s a star; Morello’s3 gone, the watch-lights show the wall, The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. Come from the window, love,—come in, at last, Inside the melancholy little house (50) We built to be so gay with. God is just. (1855) 1Rafael, Italian painter (1483-1520) 2Michelangelo, Italian painter and sculptor (1475-1564) 3A mountain north of Florence",
