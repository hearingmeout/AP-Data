    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The Race When I got to the airport I rushed up to the desk, bought a ticket, ten minutes later they told me the flight was cancelled, the doctors had said my father would not live through the night (5) and the flight was cancelled. A young man with a dark blond moustache told me another airline had a non-stop leaving in seven minutes. See that elevator over there, well go (10) down to the first floor, make a right, you’ll see a yellow bus, get off at the second Pan Am terminal, I ran, I who have no sense of direction raced exactly where he’d told me, a fish (15) slipping upstream deftly against the flow of the river. I jumped off that bus with those bags I had thrown everything into in five minutes, and ran, the bags wagged me from side to side as if (20) to prove I was under the claims of the material, I ran up to a man with a white flower on his breast, I who always go to the end of the line, I said Help me. He looked at my ticket, he said Make a left and then a right, go up the moving stairs and then (25) run. I lumbered up the moving stairs, at the top I saw the corridor, and then I took a deep breath, I said Goodbye to my body, goodbye to comfort, I used my legs and heart as if I would (30) gladly use them up for this, to touch him again in this life. I ran, and the bags banged me, wheeled and coursed in skewed orbits, I have seen pictures of women running, their belongings tied (35) in scarves grasped in their fists, I blessed my long legs he gave me, my strong heart I abandoned to its own purpose, I ran to Gate 17 and they were just lifting the thick white (40) lozenge of the door to fit it into the socket of the plane. Like the one who is not too rich, I turned sideways and slipped through the needle’s eye,1 and then I walked down the aisle toward my father. The jet (45) was full, and people’s hair was shining, they were smiling, the interior of the plane was filled with a mist of gold endorphin2 light, I wept as people weep when they enter heaven, in massive relief. We lifted up (50) gently from one tip of the continent and did not stop until we set down lightly on the other edge. I walked into his room and watched his chest rise slowly and sink again, all night (55) I watched him breathe. “The Race” from The Father by Sharon Olds, copyright © 1992 by Sharon Olds.
