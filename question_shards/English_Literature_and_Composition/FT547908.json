    "description": "Read the following lines carefully before you choose your answers. Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; But further way found none; so thick entwined, As one continued brake, the undergrowth (5) Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed All path of man or beast that passed that way. One gate there only was, and that looked east On the other side: which when the Arch-Felon saw, Due entrance he disdained, and, in contempt, (10) At one slight bound high overleaped all bound Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve, (15) In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o’er the fence with ease into the fold; Or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors, Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault, (20) In at the window climbs, or o’er the tiles: So clomb this first grand Thief into God’s fold; So since into his Church lewd hirelings climb.
