    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The Frog in the Swimming Pool A wet green velvet scums the swimming pool, furring the cracks. The deep end swims in a hatful of rain, not enough to float the bedspring barge, the tug of shopping cart. (5) Green-wet himself, the bullfrog holds his court, sounding the summons to a life so low he’s yet to lure a mate. Under the lip of concrete slab he reigns, a rumble of rock, a flickering of sticky tongue that’s licked (10) at any morsel winging into view. How would he love her? Let me count the waves* that scrape the underside of night and then let go, the depth of love unplumbed, the breadth, the height of the pool all he needs to know. (15) How do I love him? Let me add the weight of one hush to another, the mockingbird at midnight echoing itself, not him, one silence torn in two, sewn shut again. Down to his level in time wings everything. (20) He calls the night down on his unlovely head, on the slimy skin that breathes the slimy air— the skin that’s shed and still he is the same, the first voice in the world, the last each night. His call has failed to fill the empty house (25) across the street, the vacant swing that sways halfheartedly, the slide slid into rust, the old griefs waiting burial by the new. * Lines 11-14 allude to the Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) sonnet that begins, “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.” From Off-Season at the Edge of the World. Copyright 1994 by Debora Greger. Used with permission of the poet and the University of Illinois Press.",
