    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Time was, a sober Englishman wou’d knock His servants up, and rise by five a clock, Instruct his Family in ev'ry rule, And send his Wife to Church, his Son to school. (5) To worship like his Fathers was his care; To teach their frugal Virtues to his Heir; To prove, that Luxury could never hold; And place, on good Security, his Gold. Now Times are chang'd, and one Poetick Itch (10) Has seiz'd the Court and City, Poor and Rich: Sons, Sires, and Grandsires, all will wear the Bays, Our Wives read Milton, and our Daughters Plays, To Theatres, and to Rehearsals throng, And all our Grace at Table is a Song. (15) I, who so oft renounce the Muses, lye, Not—'s self e'er tells more Fibs than I; When, sick of Muse, our follies we deplore, And promise our best Friends to ryme no more; We wake next morning in a raging Fit, (20) And call for Pen and Ink to show our Wit. He serv'd a ’Prenticeship, who sets up shop; Ward try'd on Puppies, and the Poor, his Drop; Ev’n Radcliff’s Doctors travel first to France, Nor dare to practise till they’ve learn'd to dance. (25) Who builds a Bridge that never drove a pyle? (Should Ripley venture, all the World would smile) But those who cannot write, and those who can, All ryme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man. Yet Sir, reflect, the mischief is not great; (30) These Madmen never hurt the Church or State: Sometimes the Folly benefits mankind; And rarely Av’rice taints the tuneful mind. Allow him but his Play-thing of a Pen, He ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men: (35) Flight of Cashiers, or Mobs, he'll never mind; And knows no losses while the Muse is kind. To cheat a Friend, or Ward, he leaves to Peter; The good man heaps up nothing but mere metre, Enjoys his Garden and his Book in quiet; (40) And then—a perfect Hermit in his Diet. Of little use the Man you may suppose, Who says in verse what others say in prose; Yet let me show, a Poet's of some weight, And (tho’ no Soldier) useful to the State. (45) What will a Child learn sooner than a song? What better teach a Foreigner the tongue? What's long or short, each accent where to place, And speak in publick with some sort of grace. I scarce can think him such a worthless thing, (50) Unless he praise some monster of a King, Or Virtue, or Religion turn to sport, To please a lewd, or un-believing Court.",
