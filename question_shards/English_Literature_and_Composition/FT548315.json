    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. A Whippoorwill in the Woods Night after night, it was very nearly enough, they said, to drive you crazy: a whippoorwill in the woods repeating itself like the stuck groove of an LP with a defect, and no way possible (5) of turning the thing off. And night after night, they said, in the insomniac small hours the whipsawing voice of obsession would have come in closer, the way a sick thing does when it's done for—or maybe the reason (10) was nothing more melodramatic than a night-flying congregation of moths, lured in in their turn by house-glow, the strange heat of it—imagine the nebular dangerousness, if one were a moth, the dark pockmarked with beaks, the great (15) dim shapes, the bright extinction— if moths are indeed, after all, what a whippoorwill favors. Who knows? Anyhow, from one point of view insects are to be seen as an ailment, moths above all: the filmed-over, innumerable nodes of spun-out tissue (20) untidying the trees, the larval spew of such hairy hordes, one wonders what use they can be other than as a guarantee no bird goes hungry. We're like that. The webbiness, the gregariousness of the many are what we can't abide. (25) We single out for notice above all what's disjunct, the way birds are, with their unhooked-up, cheekily anarchic dartings and flashings,their uncalled-for color— the indelible look of the rose-breasted grosbeak (30) an aunt of mine, a noticer of such things before the noticing had or needed a name, drew my five-year-old attention up to, in the green deeps of a maple. She never married, believed her cat had learned to leave birds alone, (35) and for years, node after node, by lingering degrees she made way within for what wasn't so much a thing as it was a system, a webwork of error that throve until it killed her. What is health? We must all die sometime. (40) Whatever it is out there in the woods, that begins to seem like a species of madness, we survive as we can: the hooked-up, the humdrum, the brief, tragic wonder of being at all. The whippoorwill out in (45) the woods, for me, brought back as by a relay, from a place at such a distance no recollection now in place could reach so far, the memory of a memory she told me of once: of how her father, my grandfather, by whatever (50) now unfathomable happenstance, carried her (she might have been five) into the breathing night. \"Listen!\" she said he'd said. “Did you hear it? That was a whippoorwill.” And she (and I) never forgot. From Westward by Amy Clampitt. Copyright © 1990 by Any Clampitt. Reprinted by permission of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.",
