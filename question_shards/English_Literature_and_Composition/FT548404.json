    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. I dreaded that first Robin, so, But He is mastered, now, I'm some accustomed to Him grown, He hurts a little, though— (5) I thought if I could only live Till that first Shout got by— Not all Pianos in the Woods Had power to mangle me— I dared not meet the Daffodils— (10) For fear their Yellow Gown Would pierce me with a fashion So foreign to my own— I wished the Grass would hurry— So—when 'twas time to see— (15) He’d be so tall, the tallest one Could stretch—to look at me— I could not bear the Bees should come, I wished they'd stay away In those dim countries where they go, (20) What word had they, for me? They're here, though; not a creature failed— No Blossom stayed away In gentle deference to me— The Queen of Calvary— (25) Each one salutes me, as he goes, And I, my childish Plumes Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment Of their unthinking Drums— —Emily Dickinson (c. 1862) Reprinted by permission of the publishers and the Trustees of Amherst College from The Poems of Emily Dickinson, Thomas H.
