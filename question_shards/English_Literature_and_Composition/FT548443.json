    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The speaker in this poem is visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The monument, inscribed with the names of the Americans who died or disappeared in the Vietnam War, consists of two 250-foot-long black granite walls converging in a \"V.” Facing It My black face fades, hiding inside the black granite. I said I wouldn't, dammit: No tears. (5) I'm stone. I'm flesh. My clouded reflection eyes me like a bird of prey, the profile of night slanted against morning. I turn this way—the stone lets me go. (10) I turn that way—I’m inside the Vietnam Veterans Memorial again, depending on the light to make a difference. I go down the 58,022 names, (15) half-expecting to find my own in letters like smoke. I touch the name Andrew Johnson; I see the booby trap's white flash. Names shimmer on a woman’s blouse (20) but when she walks away the names stay on the wall. Brushstrokes flash, a red bird's wings cutting across my stare. The sky. A plane in the sky. (25) A white vet's image floats closer to me, then his pale eyes look through mine. I'm a window. He’s lost his right arm inside the stone. In the black mirror (30) a woman's trying to erase names: No, she's brushing a boy's hair.
