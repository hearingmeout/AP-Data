    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The Albuquerque Graveyard It would be easier to bury our dead at the corner lot. No need to wake (5) before sunrise, take three buses, walk two blocks, search at the rear of the cemetery, (10) to come upon the familiar names with wilted flowers and patience. But now I am here again. After so many years of coming here, (15) passing the sealed mausoleums, the pretentious brooks and springs, the white, sturdy limestone crosses, the pattern of the place is clear to me. I am going back (20) to the Black limbo, an unwritten history of our own tensions. The dead lie here in a hierarchy of small defeats. (25) I can almost see the leaders smile, ashamed now of standing at the head of those who lie tangled at the edge of the cemetery (30) still ready to curse and rage as I do. Here, I stop by the imitative cross of one who stocked his parlor with pictures of Robeson,* (35) and would boom down the days, dreaming of Othello's robes. I say he never bothered me, and forgive his frightened singing. Here, I stop by the simple mound (40) of a woman who taught me spelling on the sly, parsing my tongue to make me fit for her own dreams. I could go on all day, (45) unhappily recognizing small heroes, discontent with finding them here, reproaches to my own failings. Uneasy, I search the names and simple mounds I call my own, (50) abruptly drop my wilted flowers, and turn for home.
