    "description": "A symbol is an object, action, or event that represents something or that creates a range of associations beyond itself. In literary works a symbol can express an idea, clarify meaning, or enlarge literal meaning. Either from your own reading or from the list, choose a work of fiction in which a symbol reveals something complex about the characters or themes within the work. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze what complex idea or meaning the symbol reveals and how it contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.
