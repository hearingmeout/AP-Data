Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument. Thou Blind Man’s Mark Thou blind man’s mark,1 thou fool’s self-chosen snare, Fond fancy’s scum, and dregs of scattered thought; Band of all evils, cradle of causeless care; Thou web of will, whose end is never wrought; (5)Desire, desire! I have too dearly bought, With price of mangled mind, thy worthless ware; Too long, too long, asleep thou hast me brought, Who should my mind to higher things prepare. But yet in vain thou hast my ruin sought; (10)In vain thou madest me to vain things aspire; In vain thou kindlest all thy smoky fire; For virtue hath this better lesson taught— Within myself to seek my only hire,2 Desiring naught but how to kill desire. 1harvest 2reward",
