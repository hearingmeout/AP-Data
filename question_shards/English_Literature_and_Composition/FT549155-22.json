    "description": "Critic Roland Barthes has said, \"Literature is the question minus the answer.” Either from your own reading or from the list, choose a work of fiction which raises a central question. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze the central question the work raises, the extent to which it offers any answers, and how it contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.
