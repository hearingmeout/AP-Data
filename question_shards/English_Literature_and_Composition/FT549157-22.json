    "description": "The eighteenth-century British novelist Laurence Sterne wrote, \"No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing thing it is to have a man's mind torn asunder by two projects of equal strength, both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at the same time.\" Either from your own reading or from the list, choose a work of fiction in which the mind of a character (not necessarily the protagonist) is pulled in conflicting directions by two compelling desires, ambitions, obligations, or influences. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the conflict within the character between these two competing forces contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.
