Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument. The Death of a Toad A toad the power mower caught, Chewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got To the garden verge, and sanctuaried him Under the cineraria leaves, in the shade (5)Of the ashen and heartshaped leaves, in a dim, Low, and a final glade. The rare original heartsblood goes, Spends in the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, flows In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies (10)As still as if he would return to stone, And soundlessly attending, dies Toward some deep monotone, Toward misted and ebullient seas And cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia's emperies. (15)Day dwindles, drowning and at length is gone In the wide and antique eyes, which still appear To watch, across the castrate lawn, The haggard daylight steer. —Richard Wilbur \"The Death of a Toad,” from Ceremony and Other Poems by Richard Wilbur.
