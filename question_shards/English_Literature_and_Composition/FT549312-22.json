    "description": "The British novelist Fay Weldon offers this observation about happy endings: “The writers, I do believe, who get the best and most lasting response from readers are the writers who offer a happy ending through moral development. By a happy ending, I do not mean mere fortunate events—a marriage or a last-minute rescue from death—but some kind of spiritual reassessment or moral reconciliation, even with the self, even at death.” Either from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which the ending includes a “spiritual reassessment or moral reconciliation.” Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how that “spiritual reassessment or moral reconciliation” contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.
