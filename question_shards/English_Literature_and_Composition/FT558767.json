    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Jean Toomer's poem \"November Cotton Flower\" was published in 1923. November Cotton Flower Boll-weevil’s1 coming, and the winter’s cold, Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old, And cotton, scarce as any southern snow, Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow, (5) Failed in its function as the autumn rake; Drouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take All water from the streams; dead birds were found In wells a hundred feet below the ground— Such was the season when the flower bloomed. (10) Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed Significance. Superstition saw Something it had never seen before: Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear, Beauty so sudden for that time of year. 1A boll-weevil is a beetle that feeds on cotton buds. “November Cotton Flower,” from CANE by Jean Toomer.
