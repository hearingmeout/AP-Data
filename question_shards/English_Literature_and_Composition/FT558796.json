    "description": "The following questions refer to this poem. Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. George Herbert's poem \"The Forerunners\" was published in 1633. The Forerunners1 The harbingers are come. See, see their mark; White is their colour, and behold my head. But must they have my brain? Must they dispark Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred? (5) Must dulnesse turn me to a clod? Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God. Good men ye be, to leave me my best room, Ev’n all my heart, and what is lodged there: I passe2 not, I, what of the rest become, (10) Thou art still my God, be out of fear.3 He will be pleased with that dittie; And if I please him, I write fine and wittie. Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors. But will ye leave me thus? when ye before (15) Of stews4 and brothels onely knew the doores, Then did I wash you with my tears, and more, Brought you to Church well drest and clad: My God must have my best, ev’n all I had. Louely enchanting language, sugar-cane, (20) Hony of roses, whither wilt thou flie? Hath some fond5 lover tic’d6 thee to thy bane?7 And wilt thou leave the Church, and love a stie? Fie, thou wilt soil thy broider’d coat, And hurt thy self, and him that sings the note. (25) Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung, With canvas, not with arras8 clothe their shame: Let follie speak in her own native tongue. True beautie dwells on high: ours is a flame But borrow’d thence to light us thither. (30) Beautie and beauteous words should go together. Yet if you go, I passe not; take your way: For, Thou art still my God, is all that ye Perhaps with more embellishment can say. Go birds of spring: let winter have his fee, (35) Let a bleak palenesse chalk the doore, So all within be livelier then before. 1an advance guard that traveled ahead of an important visitor to secure suitable lodgings, the door of which would then be marked with white chalk 2care 3be...fear: is not endangered 4houses of prostitution 5foolish 6enticed 7ruin 8rich fabric",
