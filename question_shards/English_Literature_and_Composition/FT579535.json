    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Joseph Seamon Cotter's poem \"Prologue to a Supposed Play\" was published in 1898. Prologue to a Supposed Play My worthy hearers, have you come tonight To feast on comedy that’s brisk and light, And gladly spend an idle hour or two Line In viewing pictures that are just like you? (5) If this is what you want, just let me say You couldn’t turn your heads a better way; And for each cent you gave to enter here You should take back a modicum of cheer, And weigh yourselves so well that you will be (10) Arrayed against your insufficiency. But this is preaching? Well, the comic stage Has preached through ridicule to every age. Man scorns his shallow deed and sordid pelf1 When he’s employed in laughing at himself. (15) So let us preach in every way that can Lift man up to the dignity of man. Now, don’t be too exact, but let good sense Decide the point of honest eminence; And bear in mind that what is trite and true, (20) If well managed, is worthy through and through. But to the play. It comes in five long acts, In which the weapons used are naked facts. There is no effort made to polish darts That find a lodgement in deceitful hearts, (25) Nor to put on the rouge an honest mask, For that would be, indeed, a fruitless task. The characters are plain, as you will see, And richly freighted with humanity; And, by the way, their actions prove in making (30) A man of noble parts; the undertaking Is such that nature seldom deigns to run The same material on from sire to son. The actors are a queer and jolly set, Whose fun increases as you fume and fret; (35) So, should they hurl at you eccentric airs, Just dodge as though they struck you unawares, Or jesting strive to make a pointed hit, Just hold your peace and let it pass for wit. Now, my good hearers, hint what I shall say next. (40) You want to hear no more? Bring on the play next? Well, here it is, and if you don’t grow wiser, Censure yourselves as well as the advisor. 1wealth",
