    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. John Donne's poem \"The Dream\" was published in 1633. The Dream Image of her whom I love, more than she, Whose fair impression in my faithful heart, Makes me her medal, and makes her love me, As kings do coins, to which their stamps impart (5) The value: go, and take my heart from hence, Which now is grown too great and good for me: Honours oppress weak spirits, and our sense Strong objects dull; the more, the less we see. When you are gone, and reason gone with you, (10) Then fantasy is queen and soul, and all; She can present joys meaner1 than you do; Convenient, and more proportional. So, if I dream I have you, I have you, For, all our joys are but fantastical. (15) And so I ’scape the pain, for pain is true; And sleep which locks up sense, doth lock out all. After a such fruition I shall wake, And, but the waking, nothing shall repent; And shall to love more thankful sonnets make, (20) Than if more honour, tears, and pains were spent. But dearest heart, and dearer image stay; Alas, true joys at best are dream enough; Though you stay here you pass too fast away: For even at first life’s taper is a snuff.2 (25) Filled with her love, may I be rather grown Mad with much heart, than idiot with none. 1more moderate 2candle end; burned-out piece of wick",
