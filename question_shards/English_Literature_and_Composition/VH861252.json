    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.George Herbert (1593–1633) was one of the English metaphysical poets. In 1630, he was ordained an Anglican priest and made rector at Bemerton. His collected poetry was not published until after his death, when his friend Nicholas Ferrar had it published as The Temple (1633).Time Meeting with Time, “Slack thing,” said I, “Thy scythe1scythe: long-handled blade used for cutting grass or grain by hand. is dull; whet2whet: sharpen. it for shame.” “No marvel, sir,” he did reply, “If it at length deserve some blame;5But where one man would have me grind it, Twenty for one too sharp do find it.” “Perhaps some such of old did pass, Who above all things loved this life; To whom thy scythe a hatchet was,10Which now is but a pruning knife.
