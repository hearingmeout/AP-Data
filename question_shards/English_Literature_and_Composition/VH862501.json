    "description": "In the poem by Louis MacNeice (published in 1933), the speaker describes typical activities of a Sunday morning. Read the poem carefully. Write a paragraph in which you make a defensible claim regarding how MacNeice uses poetic elements and techniques to convey a complex understanding of the significance of Sunday morning. In your paragraph, you should incorporate at least one piece of evidence from the text to support your claim. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a claim that presents an interpretation. Select and use evidence to develop and support your interpretation. Explain the relationship between the evidence and your interpretation. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument. Sunday morning Down the road someone is practising scales, The notes like little fishes vanish with a wink of tails, Man’s heart expands to tinker with his car For this is Sunday morning, Fate’s great bazaar; 5Regard these means as ends, concentrate on this Now, And you may grow to music or drive beyond Hindhead*a village in England popular for day trips anyhow, Take corners on two wheels until you go so fast That you can clutch a fringe or two of the windy past, That you can abstract this day and make it to the week of time 10A small eternity, a sonnet self-contained in rhyme. But listen, up the road, something gulps, the church spire Opens its eight bells out, skulls’ mouths which will not tire To tell how there is no music or movement which secures Escape from the weekday time. Which deadens and endures. Used with Permission.",
