Stanzas Written in Dejection—December 1818, Near Naples 1 The Sun is warm, the sky is clear, The waves are dancing fast and bright, Blue isles and snowy mountains wear The purple noon’s transparent might, 5 The breath of the moist earth is light Around its unexpanded buds; Like many a voice of one delight The winds, the birds, the Ocean-floods; The City’s voice itself is soft, like Solitude’s. 10 I see the Deep’s untrampled floor With green and purple seaweeds strown; I see the waves upon the shore Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown; I sit upon the sands alone; 15 The lightning of the noontide Ocean Is flashing round me, and a tone Arises from its measured motion, How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion. Alas, I have nor hope nor health 20 Nor peace within nor calm around, Nor that content surpassing wealth The sage in meditation found, And walked with inward glory crowned; Nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure— 25 Others I see whom these surround, Smiling they live and call life pleasure: To me that cup has been dealt in another measure. Yet now despair itself is mild, Even as the winds and waters are; 30 I could lie down like a tired child And weep away the life of care Which I have borne and yet must bear Till Death like Sleep might steal on me, And I might feel in the warm air 35My cheek grow cold, and hear the Sea Breathe o’er my dying brain its last monotony. Some might lament that I were cold, As I, when this sweet day is gone Which my lost heart, too soon grown old, 40Insults with this untimely moan— They might lament,—for I am one Whom men love not, and yet regret; Unlike this day, which, when the Sun Shall on its stainless glory set, 45Will linger though enjoyed, like joy in Memory yet.",
