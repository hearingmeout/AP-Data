    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Maggie Anderson’s poem “Among Elms and Maples, Morgantown, West Virginia, August 1935” was published in 1986.

Here, the terrain allows photographers to appear acrobatic. 5Walker Evans3Walker Evans (1903-1975) was an American photographer best known for his documentary work during the Great Depression. liked standing on a hill, focusing down so it seemed he was poised on a branch. He liked the single telephone pole against the flat sky, crossed off-center like a crucifix. Beneath it, among elms and maples, is the house 10my mother lived in with her sister and their mother nearly fifty years ago. In this shot, Evans only wanted the rough surfaces of clapboard houses, their meshed roofs and slanted gables. He didn’t want my mother peeling the thin skin 15from tomatoes with a sharp knife, my clumsy Aunt Grace chasing the ones she’d dropped around the linoleum floor. That would be another picture, not this one. I look back from the future, past the undulating, unremitting line of hills 20Evans framed my family in, through the shaggy fronds of summer ferns he used as foreground and as border. “Among Elms and Maples, Morgantown, West Virginia, August, 1935” 21 lines from Cold Comfort, by Maggie Anderson, © 1986.
