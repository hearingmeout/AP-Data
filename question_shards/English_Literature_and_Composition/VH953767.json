    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers. In James Weldon Johnson’s poem “A Poet to His Baby Son,” published in 1935, the speaker addresses his infant son. A Poet to His Baby Son Tiny bit of humanity, Blessed with your mother’s face, And cursed with your father’s mind. I say cursed with your father’s mind, 5Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back, Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot, And looking away, Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond. Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet? 10Why don’t you kick and howl, And make the neighbors talk about “That damned baby next door,” And make up your mind forthwith To grow up and be a banker 15Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter Or—?—whatever you decide upon, Rid yourself of these incipient1in a beginning stage thoughts About being a poet. For poets no longer are makers of songs, 20Chanters of the gold and purple harvest, Sayers of the glories of earth and sky, Of the sweet pain of love And the keen joy of living; No longer dreamers of the essential dreams, 25And interpreters of the eternal truth, Through the eternal beauty. Poets these days are unfortunate fellows. Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way Or new things in an old language, 30They talk abracadabra In an unknown tongue, Each one fashioning for himself A wordy world of shadow problems, And as a self-imagined Atlas,2As a punishment for battling against the Greek gods, Atlas was ordered to carry the sky on his shoulders for eternity. 35Struggling under it with puny legs and arms, Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load. My son, this is no time nor place for a poet; Grow up and join the big, busy crowd That scrambles for what it thinks it wants 40Out of this old world which is—as it is— And, probably, always will be. Take the advice of a father who knows: You cannot begin too young Not to be a poet.",
    "question": "In a famous nineteenth-century poem by John Keats, “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” the speaker concludes a discussion about the nature of art by saying: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,”—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. In addressing his baby son, the speaker alludes to Keats’s poem in lines 25-26 (“And interpreters . . . beauty”) in order to make which point?",
