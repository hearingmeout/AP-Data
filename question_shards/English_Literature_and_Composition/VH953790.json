    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Richard Wilbur’s poem “Lightness” was published in a collection that appeared in 1947. Lightness A birdsnest built on the palm of the high- Most bough of an elm, this morning as I came by A brute gust lifted-and-left in the midst of the air; Whereat the leaves went quiet, and there 5Was a moment of silence in honor of The sweetness of danger. The chalice now bobbing above, Of interlaid daintiest timber, began the chute Down forty fell feet toward stone and root With a drift and a sampan1a flat-bottomed boat spin, and gripped 10Loosely its fine shelled life; now viciously tipped By a ripple of air, with an acrobat’s quick not-quite- Lost, dipped lower to whirl upright; Then, with a straight-down settling, it Descended into sunshine, and, with a hushed touch, lit 15On a mesa of strenuous grass. Oh risk-hallowed eggs, oh Triumph of lightness! Legerity2lightness in movement or action; mental quickness begs no Quarter: my Aunt Virginia, when She’d relapsed and recovered, would sit in the garden again Waiting, all lapped in an indigo-flowered shawl, 20In white for her “regular customers” call; Whose pity she parried with very-blue-eyed Attention, and giggled and patted their hands when they tried To do-something-for-her; she sat in the heart of her days And watched with a look of peculiar praise; 25Her slight voice could catch a pleasure complete As a gull takes a fish at the flash of his side. Her great Heavy husband adored her, would treat with a sudden blind sally Of softness his “visitor from the valley”; He called her “Birdie,” which was good, for him. 30And he and the others, the strong, the involved, in-the-swim, Seeing her there in the garden, in her gray shroud As vague and as self-possessed as a cloud, Requiring nothing of them any more, And one hand lightly laid on a fatal door, 35Thought of the health of the sick, and, what mocked their sighing, Of the strange intactness of the gladly dying. “Lightness” from THE BEAUTIFUL CHANGES AND OTHER POEMS by Richard Wilbur.
