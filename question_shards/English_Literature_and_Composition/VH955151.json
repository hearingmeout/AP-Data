Terminus1the Roman god of boundaries It is time to be old, To take in sail: — The god of bounds, Who sets to seas a shore, Came to me in his fatal rounds, And said: “No more! No farther shoot Thy broad ambitious branches, and thy root. Fancy departs: no more invent; Contract thy firmament To compass of a tent. There’s not enough for this and that, Make thy option which of two; Economize the failing river, Not the less revere the Giver, Leave the many and hold the few. Timely wise accept the terms, Soften the fall with wary foot; A little while Still plan and smile, And, — fault of novel germs, — Mature the unfallen fruit. Curse, if thou wilt, thy sires, Bad husbands of their fires, Who, when they gave thee breath, Failed to bequeath The needful sinew stark as once, The Baresark2A Baresark was an ancient Scandinavian warrior who fought without armor, was frenzied in battle, and was thought to be invulnerable. marrow to thy bones, But left a legacy of ebbing veins, Inconstant heat and nerveless reins, — Amid the Muses, left thee deaf and dumb, Amid the gladiators,3In ancient Rome, gladiators fought to the death for the public’s entertainment. halt and numb.” As the bird trims4adjusts her to the gale, I trim myself to the storm of time, I man the rudder, reef the sail, Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime: “Lowly faithful, banish fear, Right onward drive unharmed; The port, well worth the cruise, is near, And every wave is charmed.”",
