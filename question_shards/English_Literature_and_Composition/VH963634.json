    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Theodore Roethke’s poem “In a Dark Time” was published in 1964. In a Dark Time 1 In a dark time, the eye begins to see, I meet my shadow in the deepening shade; I hear my echo in the echoing wood— A lord of nature weeping to a tree. 5 I live between the heron and the wren, Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den. What’s madness but nobility of soul At odds with circumstance? The day’s on fire! I know the purity of pure despair, 10 My shadow pinned against a sweating wall. That place among the rocks—is it a cave, Or winding path? The edge is what I have. A steady storm of correspondences! A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon, 15 And in broad day the midnight come again! A man goes far to find out what he is— Death of the self in a long, tearless night, All natural shapes blazing unnatural light. Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire. 20 My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly, Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I ? A fallen man, I climb out of my fear. The mind enters itself, and God the mind, And one is One, free in the tearing wind. \"In A Dark Time,\" copyright © 1960 by Beatrice Roethke, Administratrix of the Estate of Theodore Roethke, copyright © 1966 and renewed 1994 by Beatrice Lushington; from COLLECTED POEMS by Theodore Roethke.
