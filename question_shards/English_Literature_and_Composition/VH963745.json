    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. This poem, “The Collar,” written by an Anglican priest, was published in 1633. The Collar1The title refers to the clerical collar worn by priests. 1 I struck the board, and cried, “No more; I will abroad! What? shall I ever sigh and pine? My lines and life are free, free as the road, 5 Loose as the wind, as large as store. Shall I be still in suit? Have I no harvest but a thorn To let me blood, and not restore What I have lost with cordial fruit? 10 Sure there was wine Before my sighs did dry it; there was corn Before my tears did drown it. Is the year only lost to me? Have I no bays to crown it, 15 No flowers, no garlands gay? All blasted? All wasted? Not so, my heart; but there is fruit, And thou hast hands. Recover all thy sigh-blown age 20 On double pleasures: leave thy cold dispute Of what is fit and not. Forsake thy cage, Thy rope of sands, Which petty thoughts have made, and made to thee Good cable, to enforce and draw, 25And be thy law, While thou didst wink and wouldst not see. Away! take heed; I will abroad. Call in thy death’s-head there; tie up thy fears; 30 He that forbears To suit and serve his need Deserves his load.” But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild At every word, 35 Methought I heard one calling, Child! And I replied, My Lord.",
