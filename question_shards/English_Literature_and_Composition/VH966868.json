    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. In Billy Collins’ poem “The Death of Allegory,” first published in 1990, the speaker refers to allegory: a type of narrative, common in painting and writing, in which abstract ideas are represented as people. The Death of Allegory 1 I am wondering what became of all those tall abstractions that used to pose, robed and statuesque, in paintings and parade about on the pages of the Renaissance displaying their capital letters like license plates. 5 Truth cantering on a powerful horse, Chastity, eyes downcast, fluttering with veils.
