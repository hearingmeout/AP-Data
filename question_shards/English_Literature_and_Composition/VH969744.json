    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers. The following excerpt is from a play first published in 1933. Believing himself jilted by his first love, Muriel, RICHARD last night tried curing his wounds by staying out late and coming home to a worried family. Forbidden to leave the house, he is feeling embarrassed, depressed, and melodramatically pessimistic about life when his sister, MILDRED, enters. (1) MILDRED: Hello! Are you allowed up? (2) RICHARD: Of course, I’m allowed up. (3) MILDRED: [comes and sits in her father’s chair at right, front, of table] How did Pa punish you? (4) RICHARD: He didn’t. He went back to the office without seeing me. (5) MILDRED: Well, you’ll catch it later. [then rebukingly] And you ought to. If you’d ever seen how awful you looked last night! (6) RICHARD: Ah, forget it, can’t you? (7) MILDRED: Well, are you ever going to do it again, that’s what I want to know. (8) RICHARD: What’s that to you? (9) MILDRED: [with suppressed excitement] Well, if you don’t solemnly swear you won’t—then I won’t give you something I’ve got for you. (10) RICHARD: Don’t try to kid me. You haven’t got anything. (11) MILDRED: I have, too. (12) RICHARD: What? (13) MILDRED: Wouldn’t you like to know! I’ll give you three guesses. (14) RICHARD: [with disdainful dignity] Don’t bother me. I’m in no mood to play riddles with kids! (15) MILDRED: Oh, well, if you’re going to get snippy! Anyway, you haven’t promised yet. (16) RICHARD: [a prey to keen curiosity now] I promise. What is it? (17) MILDRED: What would you like best in the world? (18) RICHARD: I don’t know. What? (19) MILDRED: And you pretend to be in love! If I told Muriel that! (20) RICHARD: [breathlessly] Is it—from her? (21) MILDRED: [laughing] Well, I guess it’s a shame to keep you guessing. Yes. It is from her. I was walking past her place just now when I saw her waving from their parlor window, and I went up and she said give this to Dick, and she didn’t have a chance to say anything else because her mother called her and said she wasn’t allowed to have company. So I took it—and here it is. [She gives him a letter folded many times into a tiny square. RICHARD opens it with a trembling eagerness and reads. MILDRED watches him curiously—then sighs affectedly.] Gee, it must be nice to be in love like you are—all with one person. (22) RICHARD: [his eyes shining with joy] Gee, Mid, do you know what she says—that she didn’t mean a word in that other letter. Her old man made her write it. And she loves me and only me and always will, no matter how they punish her! (23) MILDRED: My! I’d never think she had that much spunk. (24) RICHARD: Huh! You don’t know her! Think I could fall in love with a girl that was afraid to say her soul’s her own? I should say not! [then more gleefully still] And she’s going to try and sneak out and meet me tonight. She says she thinks she can do it. [then suddenly feeling this enthusiasm before MILDRED is entirely the wrong note for a cynical pessimist—with an affected bitter laugh] Ha! I knew darned well she couldn’t hold out—that she’d ask to see me again. [He misquotes cynically] “Women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want another act.”*The quote is from playwright Oscar Wilde. (25) MILDRED: Is that so, Smarty? (26) RICHARD: [as if he were weighing the matter] I don’t know whether I’ll consent to keep this date or not. (27) MILDRED: Well, I know! You’re not allowed out, you silly! So you can’t! (28) RICHARD: [dropping all pretense—defiantly] Can’t I, though! You wait and see if I can’t! I’ll see her tonight if it’s the last thing I ever do! I don’t care how I’m punished after! (29) MILDRED: [admiringly] Goodness! I never thought you had such nerve!
