    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The following poem was first published in 1914. A Lady 1 You are beautiful and faded Like an old opera tune Played upon a harpsichord; Or like the sun-flooded silks 5 Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.*a womans private bedroom or dressing room In your eyes Smoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes, And the perfume of your soul Is vague and suffusing, 10 With the pungence of sealed spice-jars. Your half-tones delight me, And I grow mad with gazing At your blent colours. My vigour is a new-minted penny, 15 Which I cast at your feet. Gather it up from the dust, That its sparkle may amuse you.",
