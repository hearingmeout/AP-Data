    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The following poem by Christina Rossetti was first published in 1881. It employs the form of the Italian or Petrarchan sonnet, a fourteen-line poem divided into an octave (eight lines) and a sestet (six lines). Typically, this type of sonnet develops two sides of a question: one in the octave and the other in the sestet. I loved you first: but afterwards your love 2Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove. Which owes the other most? my love was long, And yours one moment seemed to wax1grow more strong; I loved and guessed at you, you construed2interpreted me 7And loved me for what might or might not be – Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong. For verily3truly love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’ With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done, For one is both and both are one in love: 12Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’ Both have the strength and both the length thereof, Both of us, of the love which makes us one.",
