    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Thomas Godfrey’s poem “Verses Occasioned by a Young Lady’s asking the Author, What was a Cure for Love?” was first published in 1758. Verses Occasioned by a Young Lady’s asking the Author, What was a Cure for Love? From me, my Dear, O seek not to receive What e’en deep-read Experience cannot give. We may, indeed, from the Physician’s skill Some Med’cine find to cure the body’s ill. 5But who e’er found the physic for the soul, Or made th’ affections bend to his controul? When thro’ the blaze of passion objects show How dark ’s the shade! how bright the colours glow! All the rous’d soul with transport’s overcome, 10And the mind’s surly Monitor is dumb. In vain the sages turn their volumes o’er, And on the musty page incessant pore, Still mighty LOVE triumphant rules the heart, Baffles their labour, and eludes their art. 15Say what is science, what is reason’s force To stop the passions wild ungovern’d course? Reason, ’tis true, may point the rocky shore, And shew the danger, but can serve no more, From wave to wave the wretched wreck is tost, 20And reason ’s in th’ impetuous torrent lost. In vain we strive, when urg’d by cold neglect, By various means our freedom to effect, Tho’ like the bee from sweet to sweet we rove, And search for ease in the vast round of Love, 25Tho’ in each Nymph we meet a kind return, Still in the firstfond hopeless flame we burn, That dear idea still our thoughts employs, And blest variety itself e’en cloys. So exiles banish’d from their native home 30Are met with pity wheresoe’er they come, Yet still their native soil employs their care, And death were ease to lay their ashes there.",
