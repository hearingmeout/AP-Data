Elegy V: His Picture 1 Here take my picture, though I bid farewell; Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell. ’Tis like me now, but I dead, ’twill be more When we are shadows both, than ’twas before. 5 When weather-beaten I come back; my hand, Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun-beams tanned, My face and breast of haircloth, and my head With care’s rash sudden hoariness1covered with grey or white hair (due to advanced age) o’erspread, My body a sack of bones, broken within, 10 And powder’s2gunpowder blue stains scattered on my skin; If rival fools tax thee to have loved a man, So foul, and coarse, as oh, I may seem then, This shall say what I was: and thou shalt say, Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay? 15 Or do they reach his judging mind, that he Should now love less, what he did love to see? That which in him was fair and delicate, Was but the milk, which in love’s childish state Did nurse it: who now is grown strong enough 20 To feed on that, which to disused tastes seems tough.",
