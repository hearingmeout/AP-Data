    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. This poem is from a collection published in 2008. Pumpkin Farm, Half Moon Bay 1 Now you veer away from me like a sailor on his keel into a windless place, into gold corn blades coiling in the dry light-and-shade of furrows run over everywhere with vines, brown curls rasping like metal files 5 against the cotton weave of your sweatshirt. You enter the rows shoulder first, sideways. A note I make of your character: that instinct to minimize destruction, whistling the scalpel’s shining lyric all the way into a dark veiny passage, 10 stitching the wound to stop the pain. Meanwhile a crowd of schoolchildren out of school managed only loosely by their teachers are bruising the natural world, their voices high-pitched confusions of sea birds. Clumps 15 of little boys and girls climbing blocks of hay, piles of pumpkins, the big green tractor. They are everywhere, a scramble of jostlings and tumblings, the flinging of arms as they jump, the pumping of fists into shoulders. I know 20 the changing expressions of the faces and what is likely to happen next: boys lift pumpkins the size of basketballs over their heads, trying to smash them, wanting to see them explode. You turn back to say something I’m too far away to hear. 25 The trouble with me is I worry too much about intrusion, and imagine too purely someone else’s passions and get them wrong. Some days everything seems pointless. What moves any of us to do what we do? I go around the field of corn on a rutted 30 tractor road, pushing a barrow of pumpkins to the car. And you? Whatever you’ve said is over. You’re seeing between the rows the same unruly mess of tissues, organs, shapes such as those you’ve learned to cut into, 35 cutting like Aeneas1In Greco-Roman mythology, and as seen in the epic poem by Virgil, Aeneas was a Trojan hero who sailed the Mediterranean to Rome after the Trojan War. through waves blown red and black by a cold wind, one city or another at his back burning, and nothing in the way of his future. In the offing there is nothing but blue, water and sky— the straight, the narrow, the exact. 40 In your mind you’re rehearsing some procedure— the yards, the riggings, the sutures yare in your hands. This, like this. Yes, yes. This. You’re seeing what in the body is in the way, occlusions and clamps and the new sealing knife that burns the bleeders shut. Used by permission.",
