    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. The speaker in this poem is a tourist visiting the Italian city of Palermo. Palermo 1 It was foolish of us to leave our room. The empty plaza was shimmering. The clock looked ready to melt. The heat was a mallet striking a ball 5 and sending it bouncing into the nettles1prickly plants of summer. Even the bees had knocked off for the day. The only thing moving besides us (and we had since stopped under an awning) was a squirrel who was darting this way and that 10 as if he were having second thoughts about crossing the street, his head and tail twitching with indecision. You were looking in a shop window but I was watching the squirrel 15 who now rose up on his hind legs, and after pausing to look in all directions, began to sing in a beautiful voice a melancholy aria2song traditionally included in an opera about life and death, his forepaws clutched against his chest, 20 his face full of longing and hope, as the sun beat down on the roofs and awnings of the city, and the earth continued to turn and hold in position the moon 25 which would appear later that night as we sat in a café and I stood up on the table with the encouragement of the owner and sang for you and the others 30 the song the squirrel had taught me how to sing. \"Palermo,\" Billy Collins, Penguin Random House and Macmillan, 2013.",
