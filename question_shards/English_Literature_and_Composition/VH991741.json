    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.This poem was written in 1714, soon after the author, an Anglo-Irish satirist, moved from England to Ireland.In Sickness ’Tis true—then why should I repine,1complain To see my Life so fast decline? But, why obscurely here alone? Where I am neither lov’d nor known.5My State of Health none care to learn; My Life is here no Soul’s Concern. And, those with whom I now converse, Without a Tear will tend my Herse.2hearse Remov’d from kind Arbuthnot’s3John Arbuthnot (1667–1735), Scottish physician Aid,10Who knows his Art but not the Trade; Preferring his Regard for me Before his Credit or his Fee. Some formal Visits, Looks, and Words, What meer Humanity affords,15I meet perhaps from three or four, From whom I once expected more; Which those who tend the Sick for pay Can act as decently as they. But no obliging, tender Friend20To help at my approaching End, My Life is now a Burthen grown To others, e’er it be my own. YE formal Weepers for the Sick, In your last Offices be quick:25And spare my absent Friends the Grief To hear, yet give me no Relief; Expir’d To-day, entomb’d To-morrow, When known, will save a double Sorrow.",
