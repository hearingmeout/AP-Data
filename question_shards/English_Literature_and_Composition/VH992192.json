    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. This poem is from a collection of poetry published in 2009. Two Trees 1 One morning, Don Miguel got out of bed with one idea rooted in his head: to graft his orange to his lemon tree. It took him the whole day to work them free, 5 lay open their sides, and lash them tight. For twelve months, from the shame or from the fright they put forth nothing; but one day there appeared two lights in the dark leaves. Over the years the limbs would get themselves so tangled up 10 each bough looked like it gave a double crop, and not one kid in the village didn’t know the magic tree in Miguel’s patio. The man who bought the house had had no dream so who can say what dark malicious whim 15 led him to take his axe and split the bole*tree trunk along its fused seam, then dig two holes. And no, they did not die from solitude; nor did their branches bear a sterile fruit; nor did their unhealed flanks weep every spring 20 for those four yards that lost them everything, as each strained on its shackled root to face the other’s empty, intricate embrace. They were trees, and trees don’t weep or ache or shout. And trees are all this poem is about. “Two Trees” from RAIN by Don Paterson. Copyright © 2009 by Don Paterson.
