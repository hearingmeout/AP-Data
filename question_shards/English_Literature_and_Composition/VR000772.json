    "description": "Many literary works feature characters who approach the world from different perspectives and have different priorities. When these characters interact, the conflict arising from the characters’ differing values may have significant implications within the work. Either from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which there are characters whose values and/or perspectives differ. Then, write a thesis statement that you might use for an essay that analyzes how the interaction between these characters contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Beneath your thesis statement, write a paragraph in support of your thesis that uses at least one piece of evidence from the text. Do not merely summarize the plot. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Provide evidence to support your interpretation.
