    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. John Donne’s poem “The Good-Morrow” was first published in 1633. The Good-Morrow 1 I wonder, by my troth,1a pledge of faithfulness what thou and I Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then, But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? Or snorted we in the seven sleepers’ den?2In ancient tradition, the Seven Sleepers refers to a group of young men who hid in a cave to avoid religious persecution; they fell asleep and remained in the cave for hundreds of years. 5’Twas so; But this, all pleasures fancies be. If ever any beauty I did see, Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. And now good morrow to our waking souls, Which watch not one another out of fear; 10 For love all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room an everywhere. Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one. 15 My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; Where can we find two better hemispheres, Without sharp North, without declining West? Whatever dies was not mixed equally; 20 If our two loves be one, or thou and I Love so alike that none do slacken, none can die.",
