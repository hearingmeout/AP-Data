    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Augusta Cooper Bristol’s poem “Night” was published in 1895. Night 1 I stood and watched the still, mysterious Night, Steal from her shadowy caverns in the East, To work her deep enchantments on the world. Her black veil floated down the silent glens, 5 While her dark sandalled feet, with noiseless tread, Moved to a secret harmony. Along The brows of the majestic hills, she strung Her glorious diamonds so stealthily, It never marred their dreams; and in the deep, 10Cool thickets of the wood, where scarce the Day Could reach the dim retreat, her dusky hand Pinned on the breast of the exhaling flower, A glittering gem; while all the tangled ferns And forest lace-work, as she moved along, 15Grew moist and shining. Who would e’er have guessed, The queenly Night would deign to stoop and love A little flower! And yet, with all her stealth, I saw her press her damp and cooling lip 20Upon the feverish bosom of a Rose; At which a watchful bird poured sudden forth A love-sick song, of sweet and saddest strain. Upon the ivied rocks, and rugged crags On which the ocean billows break, she hung 25Her sombre mantle; and the gray old sea That had been high in tumult all the day, Became so mesmerized beneath her wiles, He seemed a mere reflection of herself. The billows sank into a dimpled sleep; 30Only the little tide-waves glided up To kiss the blackness of the airy robe That floated o’er them. Long I stood and watched The mystic, spell-like influence of Night; 35Till o’er the eastern hills, came up the first Faint glories of the crown that Phoebus*another name for Apollo, a Greek god associated with the sun. wears. And soon, the Earth, surprised to see the work That Night had wrought, began to glow and blush, Like maidens, conscious of the glance of Love. 40While she, — the dark Enchantress, — like to one Who decorates her bower with all things fair, Wherewith to please her lover, but yet flees At his approaching step, — at the first gleam That lit the zenith from the Day-god’s eye, 45Fled timid o’er the distant western hills.",
