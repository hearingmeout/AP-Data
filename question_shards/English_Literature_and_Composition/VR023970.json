    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers. Anne Sexton's poem \"Walking in Paris\" was published in 1966. Walking in Paris I come back to your youth, my Nana, as if I might clean off the mad woman you became, withered and constipated, 5howling into your own earphone. I come, in middle age, to find you at twenty in high hair and long Victorian skirts trudging shanks’ mare*on one’s own legs fifteen miles a day in Paris because you could not afford a carriage. 10I have walked sixteen miles today. I have kept up. I read your Paris letters of 1890. Each night I take them to my thin bed and learn them as an actress learns her lines. 15“Dear homefolks” you wrote, not knowing I would be your last home, not knowing that I’d peel your life back to its start. What is so real as walking your streets! I too have the sore toe you tend with cotton. 20In Paris 1890 was yesterday and 1940 never happened— the soiled uniform of the Nazi has been unravelled and reknit and resold. To be occupied or conquered is nothing— 25to remain is all! Having come this far I will go farther. You are my history (that stealer of children) and I have entered you. 30I have deserted my husband and my children, the Negro issue, the late news and the hot baths. My room in Paris, no more than a cell, is crammed with 58 lbs. of books. They are all that is American and forgotten. 35I read your letters instead, putting your words into my life. Come, old woman, we will be sisters! We will price the menus in the small cafés, count francs, 40observe the tower where Marie Antoinette awaited her beheading, kneel by the rose window of Notre Dame, and let cloudy weather bear us home early to huddle by the weak stove in Madame’s kitchen. We will set out tomorrow in stout shoes 45to buy a fur muff for our blue fingers. I take your arms boldly, each day a new excursion. Come, my sister, we are two virgins, 50our lives once more perfected and unused. “Walking in Paris” from Live Or Die by Anne Sexton. Copyright © 1966 by Anne Sexton, renewed 1994 by Linda G. Sexton.
