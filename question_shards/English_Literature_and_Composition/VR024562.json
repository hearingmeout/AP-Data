    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers. Bliss Carman's poem \"Low Tide on Grand Pré\" was published in 1887. Low Tide on Grand Pré The sun goes down, and over all These barren reaches by the tide Such unelusive glories fall, I almost dream they yet will bide 5Until the coming of the tide. And yet I know that not for us, By any ecstasy of dream, He lingers to keep luminous A little while the grievous stream, 10Which frets, uncomforted of dream,— A grievous stream, that to and fro Athrough the fields of Acadie1Acadie, Canada, is a coastal region with exceptionally low (ebb) and high (flood) tides. Goes wandering, as if to know Why one beloved face should be 15So long from home and Acadie! Was it a year or lives ago We took the grasses in our hands, And caught the summer flying low Over the waving meadow lands, 20And held it there between our hands? The while the river at our feet— A drowsy inland meadow stream— At set of sun the after-heat Made running gold, and in the gleam 25We freed our birch2a canoe made of birch bark upon the stream. There down along the elms at dusk We lifted dripping blade to drift, Through twilight scented fine like musk, Where night and gloom awhile uplift, 30Nor sunder soul and soul adrift. And that we took into our hands— Spirit of life or subtler thing— Breathed on us there, and loosed the bands Of death, and taught us, whispering, 35The secret of some wonder-thing. Then all your face grew light, and seemed To hold the shadow of the sun; The evening faltered, and I deemed That time was ripe, and years had done 40Their wheeling underneath the sun. So all desire and all regret, And fear and memory, were naught; One to remember or forget The keen delight our hands had caught; 45Morrow and yesterday were naught! The night has fallen, and the tide... Now and again comes drifting home, Across these aching barrens wide, A sigh like driven wind or foam: 50In grief the flood is bursting home!",
