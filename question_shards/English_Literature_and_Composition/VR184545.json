    "description": "Anne Finch’s poem “To the Nightingale” was published in 1713. To the Nightingale Exert thy voice, sweet harbinger of spring! This moment is thy time to sing, This moment I attend to praise, And set my numbers to thy lays. 5 Free as thine shall be my song; As thy music, short, or long. Poets, wild as thee, were born, Pleasing best when unconfined, When to please is least designed, 10 Soothing but their cares to rest; Cares do still their thoughts molest, And still th’ unhappy poet’s breast, Like thine, when best he sings, is placed against a thorn. She begins, Let all be still! 15 Muse, thy promise now fulfill! Sweet, oh! sweet, still sweeter yet Can thy words such accents fit, Canst thou syllables refine, Melt a sense that shall retain 20 Still some spirit of the brain, Till with sounds like these it join. ’Twill not be! then change thy note; Let division1Elaborate variation on a melody shake thy throat. Hark! Division now she tries; 25 Yet as far the Muse outflies. Cease then, prithee, cease thy tune; Trifler, wilt thou sing till June? Till thy business all lies waste, And the time of building’s past! 30 Thus we poets that have speech, Unlike what thy forests teach, If a fluent vein be shown That’s transcendent to our own, Criticize, reform, or preach, 35 Or censure what we cannot reach.",
