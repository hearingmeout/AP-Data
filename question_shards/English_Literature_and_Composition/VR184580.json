    "description": "Richard Lovelace’s poem “The Grasshopper: To My Noble Friend, Mr. Charles Cotton” was published in 1649. The Grasshopper: To My Noble Friend, Mr. Charles Cotton O thou that swing’st upon the waving hair Of some well-fillèd oaten-beard,1Some species of oats feature long spikes that are thought to resemble hair. Drunk every night with a delicious tear Dropped thee from heaven, where now thou art reared. 5 The joys of earth and air are thine entire, That with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly; And when thy poppy works thou dost retire To thy carved acorn-bed to lie. Up with the day, the sun thou welcom’st then, 10 Sport’st in the gilt-plaits2Braided golden hair of his beams, And all these merry days mak’st merry men, Thyself, and melancholy streams. But ah, the sickle! golden ears are cropped; Ceres and Bacchus3The gods of the grain and the grape bid good-night; 15 Sharp frosty fingers all your flowers have topped And what scythes spared, winds shave off quite. Poor verdant fool! and now green ice! thy joys, Large and as lasting as thy perch of grass, Bid us lay in ’gainst winter rain, and poise 20 Their floods with an o’er flowing glass. Thou best of men and friends! we will create A genuine summer in each other’s breast; And spite of this cold time and frozen fate Thaw us a warm seat to our rest. 25 Our sacred hearths shall burn eternally As vestal flames; the north-wind, he Shall strike his frost-stretched wings, dissolve and fly This Etna4Mount Etna is a volcano in Sicily. in epitome. Dropping December shall come weeping in, 30 Bewail the usurping of his reign; But when in showers of old Greek5Wine we begin Shall cry he hath his crown again! Night as clear Hesper6The evening star shall our tapers whip From the light casements where we play, 35 And the dark hag from her black mantle strip, And stick there everlasting day. Thus richer than untempted kings are we, That asking nothing, nothing need: Though Lord of all what seas embrace, yet he 40 That wants himself is poor indeed.",
