    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Alexander Lawrence Posey’s poem “My Hermitage” was published in 1900. My Hermitage1the secluded dwelling of a hermit Between me and the noise of strife Are walls of mountains set with pine; The dusty care-strewn paths of life Lead not to this retreat of mine. 5I live with Echo and with Song, And Beauty leads me forth to see Her temple’s colonnades,2a row of columns supporting a roof and long Together do we love to be. The mountains wall me in complete, 10 And leave me but a bit of blue Above. All year, the days are sweet— How sweet! And all the long nights thro’ I hear the river flowing by Along its sandy bars; 15Behold, far in the midnight sky, An infinite of stars! ’Tis sweet, when all is still, When darkness gathers round, To hear, from hill to hill, 20 The far, the wandering sound. The cedar and the pine Have pitched their tents with me. What freedom vast is mine! What room of mystery! 25And on the dreamy southern breeze, That steals in like a laden bee And sighs for rest among the trees, Are far-blown bits of melody. What afterglows the twilights hold, 30 The darkening skies along! And O, what rose-like dawns unfold, That smite the hills to song! High in the solitude of air, The gray hawk circles on and on, 35Till, like a spirit soaring there, His image pales and he is gone!",
