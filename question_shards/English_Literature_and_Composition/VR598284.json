    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.Mercedes de Acosta’s poem “Life and Youth” was published in 1921.Life and Youth Through the archways of Life I tread, Nor do I walk with much less dread, Because I know That where I go,5Millions have walked before me. I do not feel less pain because ’tis said, That saints and martyrs and soldiers have bled For what they gave. I am not brave10Because of this. I weep not less, Because in distress Others, perhaps being stronger, have not wept as much; For Stoics,1members of a school of philosophy who hold the belief that one should be free from passion and unmoved by joy or grief and tearless people, and because of such15Restraint, I hold not back my tears. I borrow not my courage from the crowd. My heart is heavy and my head is bowed— But were I to raise my head high, And cast my eyes up to the sky,20A star might guide me. I cannot be what has been, I cannot see what’s been seen. I shape my course, And gather force,25From what’s to come. The future is my golden star, My inspiration—and from afar, I see the deeds that may be done, I watch a race that may be run,30And hold my breath in ecstasy. Away! Black shadows of the past, Stale traditions that hold us fast. Because they were, Must we not stir35From off their worn out path? I take up the spade of Youth and of Life, And fling new pebbles on the path, where strife Has worn the old ones out. I dig and put to rout,2“Put to rout” is an expression meaning force out.40Old fancies and old doubt. Across the world I hear a clear, new note; The locks are shattered and the chains are smote, And a moonbeam has fallen across life’s shoulder. I raise my sword, and like a pioneer soldier,45I sharpen it on the Shield of Hope.",
