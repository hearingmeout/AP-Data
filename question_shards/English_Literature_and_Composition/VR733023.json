    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. Simon Ortiz’ poem “Making Quiltwork” was published in 2002. Making Quiltwork Like the coat of many colors,1In the Bible, the “coat of many colors” is a garment given to Joseph by his father Jacob as a sign of his favor. the letters, scraps, all those odds and bits we live by, we have come to know. Folks here live by the pretty quilts they make, more than make actually, more than pretty. 5They are histories, their lives and their quilts. Indian people who have been scattered, sundered into odds and bits, determined to remake whole cloth. Nothing quits. It changes many times, sometimes to something we don't want, but we again gather 10the pieces, study them, decide, make decisions again, yes, and fit them to color, necessity, conditions, taste and choice, and start again. Our lives are quilts, letters, odds and bits, scraps, but always the thread loving through them, the compassionate knowledge 15that what we make is worth it and will outlast anything that was before and will be worthy of any people's art, endeavor, and final triumph. Here, look at my clothes, quilts, coats of many colors! From Out There Somewhere by Simon J. Ortiz. © 2002 Simon J. Ortiz. Reprinted by permission of the University of Arizona Press.",
