For though we were design’d t’agree, That Fate no liberty destroyes, But our Election2exercise of choice is as free As Angels, who with greedy3eager choice 10 Are yet determin’d to their joyes. Our hearts are doubled by the loss, Here Mixture is Addition grown; We both diffuse, and both ingross:4absorb And we whose minds are so much one, 15 Never, yet ever are alone.
