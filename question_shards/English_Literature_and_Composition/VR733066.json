For though we were design’d t’agree, That Fate no liberty destroyes, But our Election2exercise of choice is as free As Angels, who with greedy3eager choice 10 Are yet determin’d to their joyes. Our hearts are doubled by the loss, Here Mixture is Addition grown; We both diffuse, and both ingross:4absorb And we whose minds are so much one, 15 Never, yet ever are alone. We court our own Captivity Than Thrones5name of a category of angels more great and innocent: ’Twere banishment to be set free, Since we wear fetters whose intent 20 Not Bondage is, but Ornament. Divided joyes are tedious found, And griefs united easier grow: We are our selves but by rebound, And all our Titles shuffled so, 25 Both Princes, and both Subjects too.
