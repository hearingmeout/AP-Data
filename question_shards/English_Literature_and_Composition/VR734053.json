    "description": "In Alice Cary’s poem “Autumn,” published in 1874, the speaker contemplates the onset of autumn. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Cary uses literary elements and techniques to convey the speaker’s complex response to the changing seasons. In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Select and use evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument. Autumn Shorter and shorter now the twilight clips The days, as though the sunset gates they crowd, And Summer from her golden collar slips And strays through stubble-fields, and moans aloud, 5Save when by fits the warmer air deceives, And, stealing hopeful to some sheltered bower,1a spot in a garden shaded by a covering of vines or branches She lies on pillows of the yellow leaves, And tries the old tunes over for an hour. The wind, whose tender whisper in the May 10 Set all the young blooms listening through th’ grove, Sits rustling in the faded boughs to-day And makes his cold and unsuccessful love. The rose has taken off her tire2attire of red— The mullein-stalk3stem of a woolly-leaved plant its yellow stars have lost, 15And the proud meadow-pink4slender plant with pink flowers hangs down her head Against earth’s chilly bosom, witched with frost. The robin, that was busy all the June, Before the sun had kissed the topmost bough, Catching our hearts up in his golden tune, 20 Has given place to the brown cricket now. The very cock crows lonesomely at morn— Each flag5plant with long tapering leaves and fern the shrinking stream divides— Uneasy cattle low,6moo and lambs forlorn Creep to their strawy sheds with nettled sides. 25Shut up the door: who loves me must not look Upon the withered world, but haste to bring His lighted candle, and his story-book, And live with me the poetry of Spring.",
