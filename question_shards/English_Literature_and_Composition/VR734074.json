In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation. Select and use evidence to support your line of reasoning. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning. Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument. The Barren Moors On your bare rocks, O barren moors, On your bare rocks I love to lie,— They stand like crags upon the shores, Or clouds upon a placid sky. 5Across those spaces desolate, The fox pursues his lonely way, Those solitudes can fairly sate1fully satisfy The passage of my loneliest day. Like desert Islands far at sea 10Where not a ship can ever land, Those dim uncertainties to me, For something veritable stand. A serious place distinct from all Which busy Life delights to feel, 15I stand in this deserted hall, And thus the wounds of time conceal. No friend’s cold eye, or sad delay, Shall vex me now where not a sound Falls on the ear, and every day 20Is soft as silence most profound. No more upon these distant wolds2hills The agitating world can come, A single pensive thought upholds The arches of this dreamy home. 25Within the sky above, one thought Replies to you, O barren moors! Between, I stand, a creature taught To stand between two silent floors.",
