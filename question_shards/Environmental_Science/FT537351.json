    "description": "",
    "question": "The zebra mussel, a mollusk native to Eurasia, was first discovered in the Great Lakes of North America in 1988. Zebra mussels attach to solid substrates and are filter feeders. Adult zebra mussels can survive for several days or even weeks out of water if the temperature and humidity are favorable. An adult female zebra mussel can produce as many as one million eggs per year. The recent range of occurrence of zebra mussels in the United States is indicated by shading in the map above. (a) Why are zebra mussels located primarily in areas in the eastern United States rather than in the western United States? (b) How are zebra mussels introduced into isolated lakes? Describe one viable method for preventing the spread of zebra mussels into isolated lakes. (c) Identify and explain one impact that zebra mussels can have on aquatic ecosystems. (d) Identify another invasive species, either terrestrial or aquatic, and describe one negative impact it has had. (e) One strategy for controlling an invasive species has been to introduce another nonnative species to control it; this strategy can often have unintended results. Give a specific example of the use of this strategy and discuss a negative impact of introducing a nonnative species to control an invasive species. (f) Discuss TWO specific characteristics of invasive species that enable them to thrive in new environments.",
