    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.Oil spills can be devastating in scope and damage. Since 1900, there have been many oil spills around the world that have had significant ecological and economic impacts.Using the data in the graph above, determine the maximum volume of oil estimated to have been spilled during the Deepwater Horizon (BP) incident.Describe TWO environmental problems that can result from oil spills in coastal areas.Identify one economic impact that results from oil spills in coastal areas.Chemical dispersants have been used in cleanup efforts following major oil spills.Discuss both one advantage and one disadvantage of the use of chemical dispersants for oil spill cleanup.Identify either one biological or one physical method (other than chemical dispersal) used for oil spill cleanup in coastal waters or on beaches and describe how the method is used.Catastrophic spills make up less than 20 percent of the oil that pollutes marine waters. Identify one other source of oil contamination and explain how the oil from this source enters marine waters.Petroleum has many uses as a raw material for consumer goods. Identify one substitute for petroleum in a specific consumer product (other than fuel).",
