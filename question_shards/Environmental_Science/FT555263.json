    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.Like many communities, Fremont has a combined sewer system that collects both sewage and storm water.When storm water runs into storm drains that connect to the city’s sanitary sewer system, the storm water and sewage flow together to the Fremont Wastewater Treatment Plant (FWTP). During a major storm event, however, the combined volume of storm water and sewage may exceed the plant’s capacity, and the overflow bypasses the FWTP. The untreated overflow is discharged into Fremont Creek along with the treated waste. Recently parts of Fremont received 5 cm of rain in 60 minutes. The storm caused widespread flooding in the northeast section of town. Especially hard hit was the Shoppes at Fremont shopping center.Use the data from the table below to answer the questions that follow. Show all calculations.Identify TWO specific pollutants in storm-water runoff that degrade the quality of surface water.Calculate the volume of water (in m3) that runs off the Shoppes at Fremont parking lot after a 5 cm rainfall event. Assume that all the water that falls on the parking lot runs off.Calculate the volume of storm-water runoff (in m3) generated in all of Fremont by the 5 cm rainfall event. Assume that only the impervious surfaces generate runoff.Assume that all the runoff that you calculated in part (c) is captured by the storm sewers in one day. Calculate the volume of untreated water (in m3) that bypasses the plant as a result of the storm. (Note that the plant still receives 5,000 m3 of domestic sewage per day.)Describe TWO ways that the volume of storm-water runoff can be reduced.Describe one environmental problem (other than pollution from runoff and from untreated sewage) that results from having extensive paved areas.",
