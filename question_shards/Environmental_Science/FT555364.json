    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Wetlands were once considered to be wastelands. Over 50 percent of the United States original wetlands have been destroyed. Describe TWO characteristics that are used by scientists to define an area as a wetland. Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems with complex food webs. Complete the diagram of the wetland food web below by drawing arrows that show the direction of energy flow. Explain why it takes many hectares of wetland to support a pair of eagles. Describe TWO economic benefits (other than those related to water quality) that wetlands provide. Describe one specific human activity that degrades wetlands. Wastewater treatment plants perform some of the same water-quality improvement functions that natural wetlands perform. Explain how wetlands perform the equivalent of primary treatment, and secondary treatment",
