    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. The graph above shows the decline in the catch of groundfish (such as cod, haddock, and flounder) from Georges Bank from 1965 to 1995. This decline in the fish harvest resulted in the closure of large portions of the fishery. Identify the five-year period during which the greatest rate of decline in the fish harvest took place. For that five-year period, calculate the rate of decline in the fish harvest, in metric tons per year. Show clearly how you determined your answer. Choose any TWO commercial fishing practices from the list below. For each of your choices, describe the practice and explain the role it plays in the depletion of marine organisms. Bottom trawling Long-line fishing Using drift nets/gill nets/purse seines Using sonar Identify one international regulation or United States federal law that applies to the harvesting of marine food resources and explain how that regulation or law helps to manage marine species. The oceans of the world are often referred to as a commons. Give an example of one other such commons, explain how human activities affect that commons, and suggest one practical method for managing that commons.",
