    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.Between 1950 and 2000, global meat production increased from 52 billion kilograms to 240 billion kilograms. During this period, the global human population increased from 2.6 billion to 6.0 billion.Calculate the per capita meat production in 1950 and in 2000.Use the values from part (a) to calculate the change in global per capita meat production during this 50-year period as a percentage of the 1950 value.Discuss why it is more efficient to produce grain for human consumption than to produce meat for human consumption. In your answer, consider both land use and energy use.Describe TWO environmental consequences of the increase in the production of meat for human consumption.Identify and explain one potential advantage and one potential disadvantage for human health of a diet that contains very little meat.",
