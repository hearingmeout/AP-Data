    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. The figures above show the age structures of human populations in three countries, X, Y and Z. Which of the three countries has the largest rate of population growth? Which has the smallest rate? Explain. Compare the infant mortality rates that are likely in Countries X and Y. Explain your reasoning. Describe the changes in both the birth rate and the death rate for a country making the transition from a preindustrial society to an industrial society. Describe one incentive that the government of a country could offer its citizens that would favor a reduction in the growth rate of its population. Explain how this incentive would work, and describe one possible drawback.",
