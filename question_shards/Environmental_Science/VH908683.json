  "content": {
    "description": "The tropical rain forests are known to have a large variety of animals. One example is the orchid mantis that is highly camouflaged when standing on a certain species of orchid found in tropical environments. Another species, the tropical cockroach, can live anywhere in the rain forest where it can find water and a food source.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements best describes why it is predicted that the orchid mantis will be more affected by global climate change than the tropical cockroach will be?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "As the climate changes, the number of orchids is likely to increase, leading to more competition for space by the mantis population.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Orchid mantises tend to be advantaged in habitats that remain constant; the rain forest habitat is likely to shift because of global climate change.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Orchid mantises are generalists, so global climate change will give them more diverse habitats to colonize.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Climate change will lead directly to the clear-cutting of the forests, resulting in a smaller habitat for both the mantis and the tropical cockroach.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Orchid mantises tend to be advantaged in habitats that remain constant; the rain forest habitat is likely to shift because of global climate change."
