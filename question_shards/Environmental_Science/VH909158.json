    "question": "Year Number of Reindeer 1 29 5 750 10 1,350 15 2,534 20 6,003 25 480 Researchers monitored the number of reindeer over time on an island off the coast of Alaska. The reindeer were introduced in year 1, and the population size was counted every 5 years. The data are shown in the table above. Which of the following claims about trends in the population size over time is best supported by the data?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The population did not have enough males to help the herd survive, so the population declined over time.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The population exceeded the carrying capacity of the island, which led to a decrease in the population size following extreme resource depletion.",

      {
        "label": "The population experienced significant reindeer immigration after year 20.",

        "label": "The reindeer formed mutualistic relationships and thrived between year 10 and year 20.",
