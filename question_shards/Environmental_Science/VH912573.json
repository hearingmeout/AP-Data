The diagram shows the highest percentages of individuals in the youngest age groups, with the percentage decreasing steeply at first and then more gradually above the age of 15.",

The vertical axis is labeled “Age,” and the numbers 15, 40, and 65 are indicated at equal intervals along the axis. The diagram shows moderate percentages of individuals in the youngest age groups, with the percentage gradually increasing, reaching its highest percentage approximately halfway between ages 15 and 40. The percentage then decreases gradually at first, and then more and more steeply as age increases above 40.",
