        "label": "Increased evaporation and cloud formation decreases the amount of solar energy reaching the surface of Earth, which leads to cooler temperatures at the surface and decreased evaporation and cloud formation.",

        "label": "Increased precipitation increases the size of high albedo snowpack in polar regions, which leads to increased habitat for Arctic organisms such as polar bears.",
