Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. One reason that people visit national parks is to view the scenery. Visibility at the four parks in the graph has been reduced over time so that by 2015 the visibility was an average of 70 miles less than the historical visibility. Regional air pollutant sources are commonly located over 100 miles away from national parks. (a) Based on the data provided in the graph, identify the national park that had the greatest loss of visibility as of 2015 when compared with the historical natural visibility.",
