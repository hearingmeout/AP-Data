    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using all but one of the documents. Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt. For at least three documents, explain how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument. Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. This question is designed to test your ability to work with historical documents. As you analyze the documents, take into account both the sources and the authors’ points of view. Write an essay on the following topic that integrates your analysis of the documents; in no case should documents simply be cited and explained in a “laundry list” fashion. You may refer to historical facts and developments not mentioned in the documents.",
