    "description": "Directions: The following question is based on the accompanying Documents 1-14. (Some of the documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise.) Suggested writing time - 45 minutes.\n\nHistorical Background: In 1650 the Dutch Republic, a political union of seven provinces, was a formidable commercial, financial; and naval power. The wealthiest and most powerful province was Holland, dominated by the influential merchant elite of Amsterdam, the leading banking and trading center in Europe. For the Dutch Republic, the period from 1650 to the Peace of Utrecht (1713) was one of shifting alliances and a series of military conflicts with other European powers.\n\nDocument 1\n\nDocument 2\n\nDocument 3\n\nDocument 4\n\nThe government of the Dutch Republic is a shattered and divided thing; the province Holland alone must expect to bear the financial burden in a war because the other provinces are poor.\n\nSir George Downing, English ambassador to the Dutch Republic, letter to the English government, 1664\n\nDocument 5\n\nWe must make defensive fortifications on land as well as outfit warships at sea; but we must also try to end the heavy taxes that are most burdensome on our merchants, especially those taxes levied to provide convoys for merchant ships. We who are naturally merchants must have low taxes, peace, and trade as well as protection, and we cannot be turned into soldiers.\n\nAnonymous pamphlet published in the province of Holland, 1669\n\nDocument 6\n\nThe king of France promises to pay to the king of England two million livres. Each of the allied sovereigns will then jointly declare war on the Dutch Republic. The king of France will defray all expenses of the campaign by land. For the war by sea the king of England will arm at least 70 warships.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover, 1670\n\nDocument 7\n\nNot only the French monarch but other kings seem more and more to scheme how to ruin what remains, of the trade and navigation of the Dutch Republic, and to take over part of it for themselves.\n\nResolution of the Amsterdam City Council, 1671\n\nDocument 8\n\nEngland's interest consists in continuing or encouraging war between the Dutch Republic and France. Either these Dutch lands will become permanently a theater of war or they will be overwhelmed or flooded, in either case ruining our commerce.\n\nKonrad Van Beuningen, Dutch ambassador to England, letter to the government of the Dutch Republic, 1672\n\nDocument 9\n\nDifferences arose with regard to the election of a military commander to lead the troops. Toward the end of 1671, the mutual distrust among the Dutch provinces hindered deliberations on how to oppose the violent attacks of Louis XIV.\n\nThe Dutch Republic, government report, 1674\n\nDocument 10\n\nOther Dutch cities and provinces all too easily consent to a recruitment of thousands of men to fight the French. But who, other than wealthy citizens of Amsterdam, much like a rich milk cow, is to furnish the money?\n\nPolitical pamphlet published in Amsterdam, 1683\n\nDocument 11\n\nThe English East India Company has grown larger and causes the Dutch much anxiety. This trade competition was the real cause of the war which broke out in the 1650's between England and the Dutch Republic. It also caused another war between the Dutch and the king of England in the 1660's.\n\nMarquis de Pomponne, French ambassador to the Dutch Republic, report to the French government, early 1680's\n\nDocument 12\n\nDocument 13\n\nThe profits of our East Indian trade have turned into losses, the Java trade is declining, and the commercial competition from the English, French, Portuguese, Chinese, and Muslims in Asia cannot be checked.\n\nDutch colonial administrator, letter to the directors of the Dutch East India Company, 1705\n\nDocument 14\n\nThe cries of widows, orphans, and tender virgins, deprived of their husbands, fathers, and young men, prevail. Dutch armies, allied with the English in this war against France, have suffered extremely: they have not a hundred men left in each battalion out of a total of thirty battalions that engaged the French at the beginning of the war.\n\nEnglishman resident in the Dutch Republic, letter about the Dutch reaction to losses suffered in the War of the Spanish Succession, 1709",
