Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“I traveled to Montpellier [in southern France] and associated there with several Protestants who have close contacts with Spain in order to learn if they ship books to Spain or know any heretics there. In order to gather this information...I pretended to be a heretic myself and proposed to take some books, such as the works of John Calvin and Theodore Beza, to Spain....A bookseller and a merchant volunteered to bring the books secretly to Barcelona to the home of one of their friends who was, as they said, of their faith. A thousand deceptions were necessary to gather this information....I learned the names of all [Protestants] from the merchant, for he told me that they were of his religion. I am staying here...in the service of God and Your Majesty.”\n\nReport by an agent of the Spanish Inquisition to King Philip II, 1566",
