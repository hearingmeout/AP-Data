Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“Among the various species or modifications of liberty, of which on different occasions we have heard so much in England, I do not recollect ever seeing any thing yet offered on behalf of the liberty of making one’s own terms in money lending....No man of ripe years and of sound mind, acting freely, and with his eyes open, ought to be hindered, with a view to his advantage, from making such bargain, in the way of obtaining money, as he thinks fit: nor, (what is a necessary consequence) any body hindered from supplying him, upon any terms he thinks proper to accede to.... You, who fetter contracts; you, who lay restraints on the liberty of man, it is for you to assign a reason for your doing so.”\n\nJeremy Bentham, Defence of Usury [Charging of Interest], 1787",
