Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the following passage from a 2008 historical study.\n\n“The Industrial Revolution, with its technology-driven economic growth, long stood as a formidable barrier to any effort [by historians] to search for economic growth based on any other factor or in any earlier period. Yet...decades of work on early modern European [economic history] have fundamentally challenged the conventional belief in a growthless, traditional economy. It is now sometimes conceded that substantial economic growth occurred before the technological breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution....[Moreover, new data] on overall British economic performance during the classical Industrial Revolution era, 1760–1830, reduces [previous historians’] growth estimates by more than half. This slower macroeconomic growth bathes in a rather less luminous light the traditional arguments about the relative importance of technology in initiating modern economic growth in this era. It also reduces the contrast with earlier decades and thus makes pre-industrial Britain as well as several neighboring countries richer, more [developed] societies than has long been supposed.”\n\nJan de Vries, historian of early modern Europe, The Industrious Revolution, 2008",
