Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“If the [Catholic clergy], so long paid and honored for abusing the human species, ordered us today to believe that...the world is immovable on its foundations,... that the tides are not a natural effect of gravitation, that the rainbow is not formed by the refraction and the reflection of rays of light, and so on, and if they based their [arguments] on passages poorly understood from the Holy Bible, how would educated men regard these commands? And if they used force and persecution to enforce their insolent stupidity, would the term ‘wild beasts’ seem too extreme [to describe them]?...\n\nThis little globe of ours, which is no more than a point, rolls, together with many other globes, in that immensity of space in which we are lost.
