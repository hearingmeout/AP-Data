Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“I am your lord and my lord is the Tsar. The Tsar has the right to give me orders and I must obey, but not to give them to you. On my estate I am the Tsar, I am your god on earth and I must be responsible for you to God in heaven... First a horse must be curried [brushed] ten times with the iron curry-comb, only then can you brush it with the soft brush. I shall have to curry you pretty roughly and who knows whether I shall ever get down to the brush. God cleanses the air with thunder and lightning, and in my village I shall cleanse with thunder and fire, whenever I think it necessary.”\n\nRussian estate owner addressing his serfs, 1847",
