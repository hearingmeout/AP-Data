The Tsar has the right to give me orders and I must obey, but not to give them to you. On my estate I am the Tsar, I am your god on earth and I must be responsible for you to God in heaven... First a horse must be curried [brushed] ten times with the iron curry-comb, only then can you brush it with the soft brush. I shall have to curry you pretty roughly and who knows whether I shall ever get down to the brush. God cleanses the air with thunder and lightning, and in my village I shall cleanse with thunder and fire, whenever I think it necessary.”\n\nRussian estate owner addressing his serfs, 1847",
