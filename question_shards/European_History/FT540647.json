Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the two sources below.\n\nSource 1: EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HÉRAULT, SOUTHERN FRANCE, 1877–1890\n\nSource 2: Excerpt from a lecture for a civics course for boys’ elementary schools, approved by the French Ministry of Education, 1883\n\n“Children, one day you will be soldiers, just as today you are students. You owe military service to your country. In defending her, each of you shall defend your father’s home, the place where you were born, the community where you have lived, the patrimony that your parents have bequeathed you. And other things still: the laws that protect you, the benefits of civilization, as well as all that past of work and glory that has made France so great among nations....If your mother is in danger and she calls out to you ‘Come to me, children!’ how is it possible not to come to her help? Think of France as the noblest of all mothers, who has suffered much and whose injuries have not yet healed!”",
