For...many of the contents therein be such as are against the word of God [the Bible], as by His grace shall be proved unto you....By the word of God, [ministry] is an office of preaching, yet they [the Anglicans] make it an office of reading. In the Scriptures there is attributed unto the minister of God the knowledge of the heavenly mysteries, and therefore as the greatest token of God’s love they are enjoined to feed God’s lambs, and yet with these [Anglican clergymen], such as are admitted and accepted...are only mere readers [of the Book of Common Prayer] that are able to say service and minister a sacrament. And that this is not the feeding that Christ spake of, the scriptures are plain.... These are empty feeders... [and] messengers that cannot call.”\n\nPetition by English Puritans to Parliament, 1572",
    "question": "The petitioners’ accusation that Anglican preachers are “mere readers [of the Book of Common Prayer]” is a reflection of which of the following Protestant beliefs?",
