    "description": "Directions: Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“In casting a preliminary glance over the vast field of female paid labor in this country, a field which may be roughly calculated to embrace about three millions of women, or half its female population, I am well assured that one department will chiefly interest a majority of my readers; -- namely the Profession of the Teacher. And this for an obvious reason, that it was until lately almost the only profession open to an educated woman of average ability. Few realize the extent to which women of the lower classes are employed in undomestic labor, in the factory, the workshop, and the field; but while all my lady readers have received instruction from some class of governess, there is probably not one who has not also some relative orcherished friend either actually engaged in teaching, or having formerly been so engaged.... Indeed, it is not a question of rank at all, for the unmarried female members of the small merchant’s family enter the profession from natural necessity, and the fortuneless daughters of the highly connected clergyman have often no other recourse. It is a platform on which middle and upper classes meet—the one struggling up, the other drifting down. If a father dies, or a bank breaks, or a husband is killed, if brothers require a college education, or orphan nephews and nieces are cast helpless on a woman’s heart, here is the one means of breadwinning to which access alone seems open.”\n\nThe English Women’s Journal, “The Profession of the Teacher,” First issue, March 1, 1858",
