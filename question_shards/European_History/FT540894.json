Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“My earliest memories are the standard postwar memories in London. Landscapes of rubble, half a street’s disappeared. Some of it stayed like that for ten years. The main effect of the war on me was just that phrase, ‘Before the War.’ Because you’d hear grown-ups talking about it. ‘Oh, it wasn’t like this before the war.’ Otherwise I wasn’t particularly affected. I suppose no sugar, no sweets and candies, was a good thing, but I wasn’t happy about it.... The fact that I couldn’t buy a bag of sweets until 1954 says a lot about the upheavals and changes that last for so many years after a war. The war had been over for nine years before I could actually, if I had the money, go and say, ‘I’ll have a bag of them’—toffees and Aniseed Twists. Otherwise it was ‘You got your ration stamp book?’ The sound of those stamps stamping. Your ration was your ration. One little brown paper bag—a tiny one—a week.”\n\nKeith Richards, British rock musician, autobiography, 2010",
