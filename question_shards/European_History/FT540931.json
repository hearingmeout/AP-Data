    "description": "The next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“Assume, O men of the German lands, that ancient spirit of yours with which you so often confounded and terrified the Romans and turn your eyes to the frontiers of Germany; collect her torn and broken territories. Let us be ashamed, ashamed I say, to have placed upon our nation the yoke of slavery. . . . O free and powerful people, O noble and valiant race. . . . To such an extent are we corrupted by Italian sensuality and by fierce cruelty in extracting filthy profit that it would have been far more holy and reverent for us to practice that rude and rustic life of old, living within the bounds of self-control, than to have imported the paraphernalia of sensuality and greed which are never sated, and to have adopted foreign customs.”\n\nConrad Celtis, oration delivered at the University of Ingolstadt, 1492",
    "question": "Celtis’ discussion of Italian influence in the German lands is most similar to which of the following?",
