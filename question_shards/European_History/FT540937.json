    "description": "The next questions refer to the passage below:\n\n“Anno Domini 1618, a great comet appeared in November. To see the thing was terrible and strange, and it moved me and changed my disposition so that I started to write, because I thought that it meant something big would occur, as then really did happen. . . . Anno Domini 1619, Ferdinand became the Holy Roman Emperor, under whom a great persecution happened through war, unrest, and the spilling of the blood of Christians. . . . First, he started a big war in Bohemia, which he then oppressed and subjugated under his religion, then almost the whole of Germany was conquered, all of which I can hardly describe and explain.”\n\nHans Herberle, shoemaker in Ulm, southern Germany, personal chronicle compiled in the 1630s",
