    "description": "The next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“The Natives of New-Holland may appear to some to be the most wretched people upon Earth, but in reality they are far happier than we Europeans; being wholly unacquainted not only with the superfluous but the necessary Conveniencies so much sought after in Europe, they are happy in not knowing the use of them. They live in a Tranquility which is not disturbed by the Inequality of Condition: The Earth and sea of their own accord furnishes them with all things necessary for life, they covet not Magnificent Houses, Household-stuff, etc., they live in a warm and fine Climate and enjoy a very wholesome Air, so that they have very little need of Clothing. . . . Many to whom we gave Cloth left it carelessly upon the beach and in the woods as a thing they had no manner of use for. In short they seemed to set no Value upon any thing we gave them, nor would they ever part with any thing of their own for any one article we could offer them; this in my opinion argues that they think themselves provided with all the necessaries of Life and that they have no superfluities.”\n\nJames Cook, British naval officer, describing the inhabitants of Australia, 1770",
    "question": "Cook’s observations concerning the material culture of the inhabitants of Australia most clearly reflect the influence of which of the following developments in Europe?",
