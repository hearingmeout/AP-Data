    "description": "The next questions refer to the passage below.\n\n“Twentieth-century Fascism is a byproduct of disintegrating liberal democracy. Loss of hope in the possibilities of existing order and society, disgust with their corruption and ineffectiveness, above all the society’s evident loss of confidence in itself, all these produce or spur a revolutionary mood in which the only issue lies in catastrophic action—but always with a strong social tinge: ‘I place my only hope in the continuation of socialist progress through fascisms,’ writes Drieu [a French Fascist author of the 1930s]. And the editor of the French Fascist publication, the Insurgent, Jean-Pierre Maxence, would call for insurgents of all parties to join ‘the front of united youth, for bread, for grandeur and for liberty, in immense disgust with capitalist democracy.’ From this angle, as from many others, Fascism looks very much like the Jacobinism of our time.”\n\nEugen Weber, historian, Varieties of Fascism, 1964",
