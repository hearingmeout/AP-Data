    "description": "“I wrote this book in the [1930s], against the background of depression at home and mounting tension abroad. The preoccupations of that unhappy time cast their shadows over its pages. I wrote with the knowledge, sometimes intimate, sometimes more distant, of conditions in depressed and derelict areas, of the sufferings of the unwanted and uprooted—the two million unemployed at home, the Jewish and liberal fugitives from Germany.... Admittedly, the atmosphere of the [1930s] had something to do with my choice of subject as well as with my methods of treatment. Many of my generation who grew up under the shadow of the First World War had a sincere, if mistaken, conviction that all wars were unnecessary and useless. I no longer think that all wars are unnecessary; but some are, and I still think that the Thirty Years War was one of these. It need not have happened and it settled nothing worth settling.”\n\nCicely Veronica Wedgwood, British historian, The Thirty Years War, originally published in 1938, excerpt from the revised introduction published as part of the 1956 reprint",
