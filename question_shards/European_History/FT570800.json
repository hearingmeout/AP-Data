    "description": "The question is based on the passage below.\n\n“The 9th [of June, 1789]. The business going forward at present in the pamphlet shops of Paris is incredible. I went to the Palais Royal [where many pamphleteers’ shops were located] to see what new things were published and to procure a catalogue of all. Every hour produces something new. Thirteen came out today, sixteen yesterday, and ninety-two last week....\n\nThe spirit of reading political tracts, they say, spread into the provinces, so that all the presses of France are equally employed. Nineteen out of twenty of these productions are in favor of liberty, and commonly violent against the clergy and nobility;... but enquiring for such as had appeared on the other side of the question, to my astonishment I find that there are but two or three that have merit enough to be known. Is it not [surprising], that while the press teems with the most leveling and seditious principles, that if put in execution would overturn the monarchy, nothing in reply appears, and not the least step is taken by the court to restrain these publications?”\n\nArthur Young, English writer, account of travels in France, published 1792",
    "question": "Since 1699 all printed materials in France had been subject to the approval of royal censors. Young’s account most likely implies that",
