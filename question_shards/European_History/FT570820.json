The church knows that it will have to account before God if the German people, unwarned, should turn away from Christ.\n\nThe first commandment reads: I am the Lord Thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. The new religion is a rebellion against the first commandment:\n\n• In it, the racial and folkish ideology becomes a myth.
