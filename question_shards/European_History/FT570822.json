    "description": "Refer to the following passage.\n\n“We see our people threatened by a mortal danger. The danger is that of a new religion. The church knows that it will have to account before God if the German people, unwarned, should turn away from Christ.\n\nThe first commandment reads: I am the Lord Thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. The new religion is a rebellion against the first commandment:\n\n• In it, the racial and folkish ideology becomes a myth. In it, blood and race, nationality, national honor, and the nation’s freedom of action become idols.\n\n• The faith in an ‘eternal Germany’ demanded by this religion replaces the faith in the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\n• This false faith creates its gods in man’s image and essence. Such idolatry has nothing in common with positive Christianity. It is the expression of the Anti-Christ....\n\n• The church must not bow to the new religion’s claim that the state can bind the individual’s conscience.... [Jesus Christ] alone can bind and loosen a man’s conscience.\n\n• Therefore the church must not allow itself to be pushed from the public sphere into some quiet corner of private piety, where, self-satisfied, it would betray its mission.”\n\nDeclaration of a group of German Protestant pastors, Berlin, 1935",
