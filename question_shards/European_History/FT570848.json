    "description": "Source 1\n\n“It is said that people have no more reason to fear forestalling, engrossing, and regrating* than they have to fear witchcraft. It is easy for a man to write a treatise in his closet; but if he would go to the distance of 200 miles from London and observe people at every avenue of a country town buying up butter, cheese, and all the necessaries of life they can lay hold of in order to prevent them from coming to market (which has happened to my knowledge), he would find that this is something more real and substantial than the crime of witchcraft. The country suffers most grievously by it.”\n\n*Crimes relating to price manipulation and hoarding under English Common Law\n\nLord Kenyon, Lord Chief Justice of England, in the court case of The King v. Waddington, 1800\n\nSource 2\n\n“The market settles, and alone can settle, that price. Market is the meeting and conference of the consumer and producer, when they mutually discover each others’wants. Nobody, I believe, has observed with any reflection what market is, without being astonished at the truth, the correctness, the civility, the general equity with which the balance of wants is settled. They who wish the destruction of that balance, and would, by arbitrary regulations, decree, that insufficient production should not be compensated by increased price, directly lay their axe to the root of production itself.”\n\nEdward Law, attorney, in the court case of The King v. Waddington, 1800",
