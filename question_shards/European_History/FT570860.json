    "description": "Refer to the passage below.\n\n“Experience has no value for the arrogant man; faith is nothing to him. He substitutes for faith a pretended individual conviction, and he dispenses with all inquiry and study. For inquiry and study appear too trivial to a mind that believes itself strong enough to embrace at one glance all questions and all facts. Laws have no value for him, because he has not made them. Besides, he thinks it would be beneath a man like him to recognize the rules established by earlier generations that he considers rude and ignorant. Instead, he believes that power resides in himself alone.”\n\nKlemens von Metternich, letter to Tsar Alexander I, 1820",
