    "description": "Use the passage below to answer all parts of the questions.\n\n“[When] the middle class, instead of struggling for change, struggles to preserve the status quo . . . a new\n\nspecies of dictator emerges—the ‘crisis man’—whose primary economic function is not the freeing of\n\nbusiness enterprise from the restraints of aristocracy, as in the past, but the suppression of the revolutionary\n\npower of labor in a period of crisis. Thereafter, the crisis-man, whose prototype is Napoleon I, looms up\n\nwhenever the established order . . . is seriously threatened from the left. . . .At a time of crisis the capitalistic\n\nbusiness man accepts the dictatorship of the Napoleon to preserve his capital and title to property, even at the\n\npartial sacrifice of his freedom.”\n\nAlbert Carr, Juggernaut: The Path of Dictatorship, 1939",
