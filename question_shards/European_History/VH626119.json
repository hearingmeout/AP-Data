    "description": "“Foreign trade can bring great wealth, but it also exposes us to great risks. The domestic economy of a state is its real treasure. For Spain, foreign trade has become a great chain binding us to vast overseas territories. Rather than worry daily about their preservation, we must pay greater attention to those certain sources of wealth in our domestic economy. We lost Flanders, we lost Italy, so why could we not lose Mexico and Peru? Little Prussia has given the world a surprising example of what a medium-sized kingdom can do on its own. . . .\nIt is necessary to inform the people of the motives for a law, and of the evils the law seeks to avoid or the benefits it seeks to provide. This is especially true in monarchies in which the people have no part of legislative authority. The true measure of good laws is the extent to which they apply equally to all citizens. Happy is the kingdom whose ruler is governed by the maxims of justice and who can balance sovereign authority with civil liberty. Happy the king who realizes that political oppression is bad for the longevity of the state and that mutual confidence and unity between citizens cannot be established if the relationship between rulers and the ruled is akin to that between masters and slaves.”\nLetter by an anonymous Spanish government official to the Count of Llerena, Spain’s minister of finance, 1789",
