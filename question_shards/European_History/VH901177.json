    "description": "“Ludovico: If it is in any way possible to measure the gravity of human sinfulness, then we should see Eve's sin as worse than Adam’s. . . . she suggested and was the cause of Adam’s sin—not he of hers.\nIsotta: But I see things from quite the opposite view. For where there is less intellect and less dedication, there is less sin; and Eve lacked these qualities and therefore sinned less. Adam must also be judged more guilty then Eve because of his greater contempt for God’s command. For in Genesis 2 it appears that the Lord commanded Adam, not Eve.\nWhen God created man, from the beginning he created him perfect, and the powers of his soul perfect, and gave him a greater understanding and knowledge of truth as well as a greater depth of wisdom. . . . Therefore, it appears that Adam’s sin was greater than Eve’s. . . . Adam either had free will or he did not. If he did not have free will, he did not sin; if he had free will, then you claim Eve forced the sin upon him, which is impossible. . . . Thus, Adam appeared to accuse God rather than excuse himself when he said: ‘The woman you placed at my side gave me fruit from the tree and I ate it.’\nLet these words be enough from me, an unarmed and poor little woman.”\nIsotta Nogarola, Italian scholar, On the Equal or Unequal Sin of Eve and Adam, text written in the form of a debate between the author and Ludovico Foscarini, a Venetian statesman, Italy, 1451",
