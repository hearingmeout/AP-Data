    "description": "“Let us consider the history of forage grasses, because these . . . were vital to the spread of European livestock and therefore to Europeans themselves. There are about 10,000 grass species, but a mere 40 account for 99 percent of the sown grass pastures in the world. Few, if any, of the 40 are native to the great grasslands outside the Old World [Europe, Asia, and Africa]. Twenty-four of the forty occur naturally and have apparently grown for a very long time in an area comprising Europe . . . plus North Africa and the Middle East. . . . The Old World quadrupeds [large grazing animals], when transported to America, Australia, and New Zealand, stripped away the local grasses. . . . Old World [forage grasses], particularly those from Europe and nearby parts of Asia and Africa, swept in and occupied the bare ground. They were tolerant of open sunlight, bare soil, and close cropping and of being constantly trod upon, and they possessed a number of means of propagation and spread. . . . When the [imported] livestock returned for a meal the next season, [the grasses were still] there. When the stockman went out in search of his stock, they were there too, and healthy.”\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 1986",
