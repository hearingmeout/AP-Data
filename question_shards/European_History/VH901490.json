    "description": "“1. We should put away completely our own opinion and keep our minds ready and eager to give our entire obedience to our holy Mother the Church.\n4. We should speak with particular approval of those who join religious orders, and the states of virginity and celibacy, not rating marriage as highly as any of these.\n6. We should approve of the relics of the saints, showing reverence for them and praying to the saints themselves.\n7. We should approve of the laws of fasting and abstinence.\n9. All the Church’s commandments should be spoken of favorably, our minds always eager to find arguments in her defense, never in criticism.\n13. To arrive at complete certainty, this is the attitude of mind we should maintain: I will believe that the white object I see is black if that is the decision of the Church.”\nIgnatius Loyola, Spanish founder of the Jesuit order, “Rules for Thinking with the Church,” 1548",
