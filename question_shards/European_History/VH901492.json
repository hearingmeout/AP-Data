    "description": "“But to what purpose are the apostles, priests and scholars of the church, who according to the Scriptures are ordained of God, if the distribution and interpretation of holy writings or the treatment of sacred books are left to common men or women, who are regarded as equal to them? God has given to his church its heralds and ambassadors. They are the only voice it is necessary for us to hear, and not the voices of these illegitimates, strangers or unknowns, trumpets of sedition, and furies which hell has vomited forth to drown this miserable century in murders, impieties, filth and sacrilege.”\nFlorimond de Raemond, Roman Catholic French scholar, History of the Birth, Progress, and Decline of the Heresy of this Century, written in the late 1590s, published in 1605",
