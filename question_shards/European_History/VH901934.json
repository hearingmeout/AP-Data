    "description": "“A royal, or legitimate, monarchy, is that in which the subjects obey the laws of the monarch, and the monarch obeys the laws of nature, granting his subjects their natural liberty and private property. A despotic monarchy is that in which the prince is lord of all goods and all persons by virtue of conquest . . . and governs his subjects as a father of a household rules his slaves. A tyrannical monarchy is that in which the monarch, contemptuous of the laws of nature, abuses a free people and treats them like slaves, appropriating their goods as his own.”\nJean Bodin, French political philosopher, Six Lives of the Republic, 1579",
    "question": "Bodin’s discussion of tyrannical and despotic monarchies reflects which of the following political developments in Europe?",
