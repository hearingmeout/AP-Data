The woman in armor next to the mirror represents Bellona, the Roman goddess of war and victory. Figures representing war lie prostrate in the foreground.\n\nThe text below reads: “Thus Peace sends forth her horn of plenty, her favors through the [Holy Roman] Empire, Spain, and France. The kings stand united, and the people are obedient under you, o great Philip [Philip IV, King of Spain], and your flourishing race. Soon war will perish and the former age will shake off all evils, and give way to a golden age.”",
