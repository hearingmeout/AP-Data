    "description": "Wenceslaus Hollar, Czech artist working in the Spanish Netherlands, Allegory of the Peace of Westphalia, engraving, 1648\n\nMuseum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, New Zealand Gift of Bishop Monrad, 1869/Bridgeman Images\n\nTwo female figures representing peace and plenty look into a mirror held by an angel. The woman in armor next to the mirror represents Bellona, the Roman goddess of war and victory. Figures representing war lie prostrate in the foreground.\n\nThe text below reads: “Thus Peace sends forth her horn of plenty, her favors through the [Holy Roman] Empire, Spain, and France. The kings stand united, and the people are obedient under you, o great Philip [Philip IV, King of Spain], and your flourishing race. Soon war will perish and the former age will shake off all evils, and give way to a golden age.”",
    "question": "The artist’s statement that the kings of France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire “stand united” most clearly suggests that",
