    "description": "“Far, far away, thy children leave the land.\n Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\n Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:\n Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;\n A breath can make them, as a breath has made;\n But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,\n When once destroyed, can never be supplied.\n\nThe man of wealth and pride\n Takes up a space that many poor supplied;\n Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,\n Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds:\n The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,\n Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth;\n\nWhile, scourged by famine from the smiling land,\n The mournful peasant leads his humble band;\n And while he sinks, without one arm to save,\n The country blooms—a garden, and a grave.\n Where then, ah where, shall poverty reside,\n To ‘scape the pressure of contiguous pride?\n\nOliver Goldsmith, English poet, “The Deserted Village,” 1770",
    "question": "Goldsmith’s reference to the actions of “the man of wealth and pride” in the second section of the poem most directly provides evidence for which of the following?",
