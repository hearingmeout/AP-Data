    "description": "“Thus, the spice trade came to link Lisbon with Asia; sugar connected the Portuguese capital [Lisbon] with America; and the slave trade forged a chain across the southern Atlantic.\nFrom this time on, all struggles for dominance within Europe would take on a global character, as the European states sought to control the oceans and to oust their competitors from points of vantage gained in Asia, America, or Africa. From then on, too, events in one part of the globe would have repercussions in other parts. The several continents would be drawn into one worldwide system of connections. . . .\nThe Dutch, then fighting their prolonged war against Spain, thus found an excuse and an opportunity to oust the Portuguese from their holdings in Asia and America. The Dutch East India Company was founded in 1602 in order to break the Portuguese monopoly over the spice trade. In 1621, a Dutch West India company was created as well.”\nEric Wolf, Europe and the People without History, 1982",
