To return you freedom, independence, honor, and happiness in the name of generous-hearted monarchs. Prove yourselves worthy of such great gifts. Earn the blood that has flowed on your behalf. Make willing and immediate sacrifice to secure an honorable, happy future. Seek to earn and preserve what the victorious allied armies* have given you.\nRemember the noble German princes, whose rule was happy and who remained worthy in good times and bad. Think of the great Imperial union and the common language, which binds you with us in perpetuity. Prove yourselves worthy of being German, and you will remain so.”\n* a reference to the forces of Russia, Prussia, and Austria that had defeated Napoleon in Germany the previous year\nDeclaration of Justus Gruner, newly appointed governor-general of the Middle Rhine region after Napoleon's retreat from Germany, 1814",
