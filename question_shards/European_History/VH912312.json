    "description": "“Go through the shops in any large town. Millions of hands—more than can be counted have labored over the things displayed there and just see! Can anything for men’s use be found in nine-tenths of these shops? All the luxuries of life are demanded and consumed by women. Count the factories. A huge portion of them are engaged in making useless ornaments, carriages, furniture and knickknacks for women. Millions of people, generations of slaves, perish at this cruel factory labor to satisfy the whims of women. Women, like queens, have forced nine-tenths of the human race to labor for them as their slaves. And all because they have been humiliated and deprived of equal rights with man.”\nLeo Tolstoy, Russian author, “The Kreutzer Sonata,” a collection of short stories, 1891",
