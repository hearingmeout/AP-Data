    "description": "“To right-minded citizens, education was to be the panacea [cure-all] for London’s woes. The working classes might or might not emerge from the Crystal Palace* at Sydenham better-versed in the history of mankind than when they went in, but there were other ways of turning them into well-informed and well-behaved citizens. The first essential was to catch them young.\nThe Ragged Schools are among the least known of Victorian achievements. They took ragged . . . children and clothed and fed them, and taught them rudimentary social skills, [and] the three Rs plus a fourth, religion, instead of leaving the children to fester in the gutter. . . . Some teachers were private individuals who did what they could, with what lay to hand. . . . Many of the teachers were professed Christians working for Church organisations such as the London City Mission. . . . There was no state aid, except for the ‘industrial training,’ usually tailoring or shoe-making for boys, for which a small subsidy was available in a few schools.\nIn 1844 nineteen of the Ragged Schools in London joined to form a Ragged School Union, with Lord Shaftesbury as its President. This gave the movement considerable clout and attracted publicity and funds. . . . By 1869 there were 195 schools in the Union. This was the zenith of the movement, which crumbled after the 1870 Education Act established government-funded Board Schools.”\n*The Crystal Palace was the site of a major industrial and technological exhibition in the 1850s.\nLiza Picard, historian, Victorian London: The Life of a City, 1840–1870, published in 2005",
