    "description": "“Another objection against enclosing*, is its apparent tendency to thin the country villages of inhabitants, and depopulate the nation in general. . . . Lesser farmers, labourers, etc. are thereby deprived of their employments; and if they are not immediately forced out of their houses, they are left to starve in them.\nIn the counties of Leicester and Northampton, where enclosing has lately prevailed, the decrease of inhabitants in almost all the enclosed villages, in which they have no inconsiderable manufactory, is obvious enough to be remarked by everyone that knew their state twenty or thirty years ago, and sees them now. They have known [cases in which] upwards of an hundred houses and families in some open-field villages have since dwindled to eight or ten; and five or six hundred inhabitants, where there are not now more than forty or fifty: a plain proof this, that enclosing depopulates the countryside.”\n*Enclosure was the practice of fencing off agricultural lands that had traditionally been used communally by villagers and reserving these lands for private use, generally by wealthy landowners\nStephen Addington, “An Inquiry into the Reasons for and against Enclosing Open-Fields,” report presented to the British Parliament, 1767",
    "question": "Addington’s information about Leicester and Northampton in the second paragraph provides most direct evidence for which of the following in eighteenth-century England?",
