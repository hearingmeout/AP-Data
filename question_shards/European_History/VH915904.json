    "description": "“I have a family of nine, and what did I have before the kolkhoz [collective farm]? I had all the produce I needed to feed my family, and fuel, and I clothed and shod them. Had a horse and three head of sheep. Delivered to the government twenty poods [1 pood = about 36 pounds] of rye, forty poods of millet, oats, potatoes, and hemp. I have worked on the kolkhoz, I have honestly earned 355 labor-days, but I no longer eat bread, but husks and potatoes, we don’t have enough to resole our shoes. My children have turned black from malnutrition. Respected editors, is there no way to leave the kolkhoz rather than perish here?”\nA.P. Kokurin, Russian farmer, letter to Izvestia, the official newspaper of the Soviet government, from the Soviet province of Mordoviya, 1932",
