    "description": "“It is not right when some make the simple folk believe that diligent confession and a worldly gift grants a papal indulgence and that thereby they can attain the forgiveness of sins. For the clink of the coin that falls into the money box will not free the sinner of his sins. Forgiveness requires first and above all else a truly contrite heart. Also, it is beyond doubt that the person may attain forgiveness of his sins by a true, honest contrition even without all the indulgences that he can avail himself of. But it is incredible and without any basis to attain pardon of sins even with papal grace if there is not first a true, heartfelt contrition over sins. . . . It is also the greatest foolishness to think sins may be greater than God’s mercy. The mercy of God is without measure and infinitely great. No one who seeks it will be denied it.”\nJohannes von Staupitz, Catholic theologian and dean of the faculty at the University of Wittenberg, sermon, 1516",
