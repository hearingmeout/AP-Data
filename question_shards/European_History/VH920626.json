By the 1880s assumptions that, because of Britain’s absolute naval supremacy, the only serious threats to the empire would be from powers able to attack British colonies overland no longer seemed valid. . . . In 1897, in spite of a great expansion of the British fleet, the battleships of the other powers outnumbered the Royal Navy by ninety-six to sixty-two. Britain had lost its naval monopoly. Thus from the 1880s other powers were acquiring the means to support probes into areas where Britain had not faced serious competition before, especially in the Far East and in Africa. . . . To many British people, the more active roles being played by the French, Germans, and Russians outside Europe were symptoms of much deeper changes on the continent itself.”\nP. J. Marshall, historian, “1870–1918: The Empire under Threat,” in The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire. Reprinted in Samson, The British Empire: A Reader, 2001\n\nSource 2\n“Perhaps the most astonishing element of this formal imperial expansion was the division and conquest of almost all of Africa—the so-called scramble for Africa. Prior to the 1870s, the sections of this vast continent controlled by outside powers were limited to small enclaves. . . . Formal European imperialism in Africa was in recession in the late nineteenth century, and no new imperial push was in sight. In fact, in 1865 a British Parliamentary Committee recommended withdrawing from West Africa entirely in light of anti-imperial popular opinion and a lack of economic motivation. Nor did any other European governments seem to want the costs associated with an African empire. By 1914, this situation was entirely reversed. In the intervening half-century, almost all of Africa had been claimed as colonies or protectorates by European powers . . . Although many Africans still denied and even fought against colonial domination, the often violent process of ‘pacifying’ local populations was well under way.”\nTrevor Getz and Heather Streets-Salter, historians, Modern Imperialism and Colonialism: A Global Perspective, 2011",
