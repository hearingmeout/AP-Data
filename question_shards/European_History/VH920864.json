    "description": "“The tendency to social conduct is a product of evolution resulting from the survival of the group in which this instinct was most strongly developed and most rationally guided. . . . If we trace that evolution from the folk-lore and custom of the most barbarous groups up to the highest stages of civilization, we recognize no permanent code of moral action apart from our social relations. Moral conduct is social conduct, and immoral conduct is anti-social conduct. And what is social and what is anti-social depends upon the condition of the society with which we are dealing.”\nKarl Pearson, “The Bearing of our Present Knowledge of Heredity upon Conduct,” lecture delivered in London, 1904",
