    "description": "“Of all the developments in the Age of Catastrophe [the period from 1914 to 1945], survivors from the nineteenth century were perhaps most shocked by the collapse of the values and institutions of the liberal civilization whose progress their century had taken for granted. . . . These [liberal] values were a distrust of dictatorship and absolute rule; a commitment to constitutional government with or under freely elected governments and representative assemblies, which guaranteed the rule of law; and an accepted set of citizens’ rights and liberties, including freedom of speech, publication, and assembly. These values, it seemed clear, had made progress throughout the century, and were destined to advance further. . . .\nExcept for Soviet Russia, all the regimes emerging from the First World War, old and new, were, basically, elected representative parliamentary regimes. . . . And yet the twenty years between Mussolini’s so-called ‘March on Rome’ and the peak of Axis success in the Second World War saw an accelerating, increasingly catastrophic, retreat of liberal political institutions.\nIn 1918–1920 legislative assemblies were dissolved or became ineffective in two European states, in the 1920s in six, in the 1930s in nine, while German occupation destroyed constitutional power in another five during the Second World War.”\nEric Hobsbawm, historian, The Age of Extremes: A History of the World, 1914–1991, published in 1994",
