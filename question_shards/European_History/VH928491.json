    "description": "“Arguably the most revolutionary movement in European history has been the progress made in integrating areas of western Europe with the ultimate objective of a united European state. The history of Europe since 1871 has been dominated by the German Question—by the need, and the general failure, to absorb the economic capacity and resources of Germany into an acceptable European political framework. An attempt to solve this problem has been, in my view, the greatest single achievement of the European movement. . . .\nIn recent years Europe’s sharpest and clearest dividing line, the Iron Curtain, has suddenly disappeared and Germany is reunified. The speed of these events has created a new urgency to clarify what we mean by ‘Europe’ and European integration. ‘Eastern Europe’ no longer exists as a separate socio-economic or geographical region. There is now only ‘Europe’. In political terms Europe has been identified with the European Community, yet until now, the EC has been a western European phenomenon.\nWith the collapse of Stalinist communism in eastern Europe, the tensions that were a recurrent feature of Europe prior to 1914 have erupted again. . . . The great task facing the European movement is to rise to the challenge of successfully integrating eastern Europe into the economic prosperity and subsequent political stability of a ‘European Community’.\nDavid Welch, historian, Modern European History: 1871 to 2000, revised edition published in 2009.",
