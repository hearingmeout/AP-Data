This France was never at Vichy.* Nor was it any longer—and for quite some time—in Paris. It was in the sands of Libya and everywhere that free French people fought. It was in London, embodied in General de Gaulle [leader of the Free French]. It was present, one and indivisible, in the hearts of those French people, those “Righteous among the Nations,” who, when the storm was darkest, risked their lives to save . . . three-quarters of the Jewish community living in France, thereby giving life to all that is best in France: to the humanistic values, the values of liberty, justice, and tolerance that are the foundation of the French identity and obligate us for the future.”\n*A reference to the government set up to rule part of France after its defeat by Germany in 1940\nJacques Chirac, president of France, 1995 speech commemorating the roundup of French Jews in Paris in July 1942, during the Second World War",
