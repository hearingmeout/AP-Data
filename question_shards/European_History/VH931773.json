    "description": "“I do not believe that Europe can have any living reality if it doesn’t include France and her Frenchmen, Germany and its Germans, Italy and its Italians, and so forth. Dante, Goethe, and Chateaubriand* belong to all Europe to the extent that they were respectively and eminently Italian, German, and French. They would not have served Europe very well if they had been stateless or if they had thought or written in some kind of integrated Esperanto or Volapük.**\nBut it is true that the nation is a human and sentimental element, whereas Europe can be built on the basis of active, authoritative and responsible elements. What elements? The states of course; for, in this respect; it is only the states that are valid, legitimate, and capable of achievement. I have already said, and I repeat, that at the present time there cannot be any other Europe than a Europe of states, apart of course from myths, stories, and parades. What is happening in regard to the Economic Community proves this every day, for it is the states, and only the states, that created this Economic Community, that furnished it with funds, that provided it with staff members; and it is the states that give it reality and efficiency, all the more so as it is impossible to take any far-reaching economic measure without committing a political action.”\n*authors of significant works of literature\n**languages invented in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with the intent of creating a universal international language\nCharles de Gaulle, French President, press conference statement on European integration, 1962",
