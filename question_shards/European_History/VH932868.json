We want to know if, for political reasons, you're going to permit them to poison Frenchmen and Frenchwomen.”\nDebate in the French parliament, 1950\n\nSource 2\n“In Frankfurt there were many GIs, also in Heidelberg and Berlin; these cities were packed with Americans. And many of the hip-hop people from New York City were deployed here as well. Additionally, there was a large club scene, where groups from the United States performed. For example, in the early 1980s our crew called Universal Movements breakdanced with the Rock Steady Crew at the Frankfurt air base. . . . In 1983 the Funkadelic opened in Frankfurt. As far as I know, it was the first club in Germany which promoted Black music that was almost totally hip-hop orientated. This club would never have survived without a US-American crowd. In this way the whole thing developed and grew larger.”\nCutmaster GB, German hip-hop DJ, discussing events in Frankfurt in the 1980s, interview conducted in 2002",
