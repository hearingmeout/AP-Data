    "description": "“What reason exists that men are the learned ones and presumes that we, women, cannot be the same? In my opinion, there is no other answer than men’s wickedness or tyranny in confining us and denying us teachers. Thus, the real reason that women are not learned is not deficient intellect, but rather lack of study. If in our upbringing, instead of putting fine linen on our sewing cushions and embroidery patterns in our frames, they would give us books and teachers, we would be just as qualified for the positions and university professorships as any man. And, maybe we women would be even sharper. . . .”\n\nMaría de Zayas y Sotomayor, Spanish author, preface to Exemplary Tales of Love and Disillusion, 1637",
