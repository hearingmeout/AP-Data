    "description": "“In Antwerp, Luther’s writings are being printed in Spanish, presumably upon the urging of the Marranos*, whom one ought to ship from Flanders back to Spain; the emperor has promised us his assistance. In Ghent the Augustinian monks proclaim Luther’s gospel in all the streets as being the teaching of St. Paul, yes, even of Christ. It has been reported to the emperor that the dioceses of Utrecht and Münster, as well as the other bishoprics of Lower Germany have been corrupted by the rot of this heresy. In Holland, Luther’s doctrine is openly propagated; the only reason why this is possible lies in the fact that Erasmus is a Hollander; even the emperor’s councilors know about this and talk about it freely.”\n\n*Spanish Jews converted to Christianity\n\nReport by the papal representative at the Diet of Worms, an imperial assembly, 1521",
