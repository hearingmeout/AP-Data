    "description": "“Power [is] one of the most necessary ingredients towards the grandeur of kings, and the prosperity of their governments. . . . As goodness is the object of love, power is the cause of dread, and it is most certain, that among all the principles that are capable of affecting a state, fear grounded upon esteem and reverence has so much force, that it engages everyone to perform his duty.\nIf this principle is of great efficacy in respect to the internal part of states, it is to the full as prevailing abroad: subjects and strangers looking with the same eyes upon a formidable power, both the one and the other abstain from offending a prince, whom they are sensible is in a condition to hurt them, if he were so inclined.\nI have observed by the by, that the ground of the power I am speaking of must be esteem and respect; . . . that when it is grounded on any other principle, it is very dangerous; in the case instead of creating a reasonable fear, it inclines men to hate princes. . . .\nThe Prince must be powerful by his reputation.\nBy a reasonable army always kept on foot.\nAnd by a notable sum of money in his coffers, to supply unexpected demands, which often come to pass when they are least expected.\nFinally, by the possession of his subjects’ hearts.”\nCardinal Richelieu, advisor to the French king Louis XIII, Political Will and Testament, 1638",
