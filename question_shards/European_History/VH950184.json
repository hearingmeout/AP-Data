    "description": "“It is necessary to conduct yourself as a good father to your people, that you love your subjects regardless of their religious convictions, and that you try to promote their welfare at all times. Work to stimulate trade everywhere, and keep in mind the population increase of [your territories]. Take advantage of the advice of the clergy and nobility as much as you can; listen to them and be gracious to them all, as befits your position; recognize ability where you find it, so that you will increase the love and affection of your subjects toward you. . . .\nSeek to maintain friendly relations with the princes and nobility of the [Holy Roman] Empire. Correspond with them frequently and maintain your friendship with them. Be certain not to give them cause for ill will; try not to arouse emotions of jealousy or enmity, but be sure that you are in a strong position to maintain your weight in disputes that may arise. . . .\nIt is wise to have alliances, if necessary, but it is better to rely on your own strength. You are in a weak position if you do not have the means and do not possess the confidence of the people. These are the things, God be praised, which have made me powerful since the time I began to have them.”\nFrederick William, the Great Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia, secret letter to his son and heir, 1667",
