    "description": "“The philosophy of the eighteenth century takes up . . . the methodological pattern of Newton’s physics, though it immediately begins to generalize from it. It is not content to look upon analysis as the great intellectual tool of mathematical and physical knowledge; eighteenth-century thought sees analysis rather as the necessary and indispensable instrument of all thinking in general. This view triumphs in the middle of the [eighteenth] century. However much individual thinkers and schools differed in their results, they agreed in this methodological premise.”\nErnst Cassirer, German historian, The Philosophy of the Enlightenment, 1932",
