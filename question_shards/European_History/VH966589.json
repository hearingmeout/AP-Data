    "description": "“TO THE WORKING AND OTHER CLASSES:\nNew and grand Cooperative, affording ample security for your comfortable and abundant subsistence; for your support during sickness or loss of employment, and in old age, for the education and moral training of your children; their instruction in useful knowledge and productive industry, and their permanent support for life, in the event of the death of their parents. . . .\nI. The families contribute to a common fund for providing the necessaries of life, at wholesale prices and at the best markets, in proportion to the number of individuals in each family.\nII. The families breakfast, dine, etc. together at the general tables; and in the evenings amuse themselves with conversation, reading, lectures, music, etc. in the public room. The individuals, however, are at perfect liberty, at all times, to take their meals, and to spend their leisure hours, in their private apartments.\nIII. The domestic duties of the females are performed under a system of combination, which greatly lessens their labor, and enables the females to be profitably employed, or to command a considerable portion of leisure for rational pursuits and innocent recreations.\nIV. Such of the females as are not required for the discharge of the duties of housewifery, and for the care of the children, are employed, during a moderate portion of the day, in such profitable work as can be obtained, for the benefit of the society at large. The elder children are also employed during six hours daily, for the common benefit, and will be carefully instructed in the principles of Christianity, and in one or more branches of useful industry.”\nGeorge Mudie, Scottish social reformer, appeal to workers to join the Cooperative and Economical Society of London, 1822",
