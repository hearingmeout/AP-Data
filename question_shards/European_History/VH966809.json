    "description": "“Russia began to receive an industrial outreach from the West within a few decades of the advent of the industrial revolution. British textile machinery was imported beginning in 1843. . . . [A] number of Russian entrepreneurs set up small factories to produce cotton, aware that even in Russia’s small urban market they could make a substantial profit by underselling traditional manufactured cloth. Other factories were established directly by Britons. . . .\nThe first steamship appeared in Russia in 1815, and by 1820 a regular service ran on the Volga river. The first public railroad, joining St. Petersburg to the imperial residence in the suburbs, opened in 1837. In 1851 the first major line connected St. Petersburg and Moscow, along a remarkably straight route desired by Tsar Nicholas I himself. . . .\nBut Russia did not then industrialize. Modern industrial operations did not sufficiently dent established economic practices. The nation remained overwhelmingly agricultural. High percentage increases in manufacturing proceeded from such a low base that they had little general impact. . . . While some free laborers could be found, most rural Russians could not legally leave their land, and their obligation to devote extensive work service to their lords’ estates reduced their incentive even for agricultural production.”\nPeter Stearns, historian, The Industrial Revolution in World History, 1993",
