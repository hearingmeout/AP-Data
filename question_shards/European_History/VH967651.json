    "description": "“The thesis that the condition of the worker . . . has improved during the last quarter or half century, does not require any more proof . . . What can we say about his leisure? Is the worker of today a greater slave to his work than in the past? . . . The evidence of the facts and figures allows us to give an unequivocal reply. The working day has been reduced to a level that makes it more humane. . . . In the recent past, for we are referring to a situation which existed only 30 or 40 years ago, a working day of 14 or 15 hours was not unusual, both in home-based as well as factory production.\nNowadays the duration of work is not more than 12 hours, and even that is much too long. French law has fixed it at this figure; Swiss law has reduced it to 11 hours, in England it is down to 9 1/2 hours . . . and it is probable soon, in the whole of Europe, that the effective working day will be reduced to 10 hours or to 60 hours out of the 168 in a week, not through legislation, but at the request of the parties concerned . . .\nThe facts that we have put together show quite clearly that all classes of the nation have participated in the general progress and that the working class has particularly benefited in the triple sense of an improvement in their material well-being, an increase in security, and the growth of leisure.”\nPaul Leroy-Beaulieu, French economist, essay, 1881",
    "question": "Beaulieu’s dismissal of legislation as an effective means of changing working conditions is best explained by the continued influence of which of the following in the late nineteenth century?",
