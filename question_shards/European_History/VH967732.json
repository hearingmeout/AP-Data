    "description": "Source 1\n\n“Most Europeans in the eighteenth century thought of their rulers as fathers and of their nations as families writ large. This familial grid operated on both the conscious and unconscious level of experience.\n\nThe French in a sense did wish to get free from the political parents of whom they had developed a low opinion, but they did not imagine replacing them with others who were of a higher social standing. They imagined replacing them—the king and the queen—with a different kind of family, one in which the parents were [removed] and the children, especially the brothers, acted autonomously. . . . The ideology of absolutism explicitly tied royal government to the patriarchal family, and the use of the term fraternity during the French Revolution implied a break with this prior model.”\n\nLynn Hunt, historian, The Family Romance of the French Revolution, 1992\n\nSource 2\n\n“The bourgeois revolution was not, of course, a single event but a historical process of economic, political, juridical, and ideological ruptures between old social institutions and new bourgeois forms. In this revolutionary process a capitalist market emerged, the political power of feudal landowners was defeated and a state representing the bourgeoisie and furthering the development of capitalism was created, in which feudal privileges were abolished and equality before the law established. In every country a particular event can normally be singled out as decisive. . . . these events, however, constituted neither the first nor the last important moments of the bourgeois revolution in each country, as the long persistence of the power of the land-owning aristocracy in England, Italy, and Germany makes clear.”\n\nGoran Therborn, Swedish sociologist, Science, Class and Society: On the Formation of Sociology and Historical Materialism, 1976",
