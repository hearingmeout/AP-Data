    "description": "“To my surprise, His Majesty [Kaiser Wilhelm II] received me with great friendliness, listened positively to my explanation, and then indulged himself in a highly detailed lecture on the navy. . . . He enumerated the ships we have and the ones we would need in order to survive a war; . . . emphasized that we had to have an armored fleet to protect our trade and to keep ourselves supplied with provisions; and was of the opinion that our fleet would have to be strong enough to prevent the French fleet from cutting off the food supplies we needed. In addition, he . . . would have to find the means, and if the Reichstag did not approve this, he would nevertheless carry on building and present the Reichstag with the bill later. Public opinion didn’t concern him. He knew that the people didn’t love him, and cursed him; but that wouldn’t deter him. I then reminded the Emperor of the difference between Prussia and the [German] Empire . . . In the Empire the Emperor only had the rights which the Reichstag conceded to him.”\nAccount of a conversation between German chancellor Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst and Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1897, published in the chancellor’s memoirs, 1931",
