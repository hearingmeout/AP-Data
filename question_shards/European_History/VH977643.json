    "description": "“What is the significance of this revolution? Its significance is, in the first place, that we will have a soviet government, without the participation of bourgeoisie of any kind. The oppressed masses will of themselves form a government. The old state machinery will be smashed into bits and in its place will be created a new machinery of government by the soviet organizations. From now on there is a new page in the history of Russia, and the present, third Russian revolution will lead to the victory of Socialism.\nOne of our immediate tasks is to put an end to the war at once. But in order to end the war, which is closely bound up with the present capitalistic system, it is necessary to overthrow capitalism itself. In this work we shall have the aid of the world labor movement, which has already begun to develop in Italy, England, and Germany.”\nVladimir Lenin, speech to the Petrograd Soviet (workers’ council), November 1917",
