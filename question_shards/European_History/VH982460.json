    "description": "“For an important body of historical opinion, the questions asked about the emergence of the Final Solution [the Holocaust] can be answered easily with reference to Hitler’s anti-Jewish rhetoric, drawn from various points in his career but seen to reflect a consistent murderous objective. In this view, Hitler is seen as the driving force of Nazi anti-Semitic policy, whose views indicate a coherent line of thought from a very early point. Hitler is also seen as the sole strategist with the authority and the determination to begin the implementation of the Final Solution. . . . This line of thought accents the role of Hitler in initiating the murder of European Jewry, seeing a high degree of persistence, consistency, and orderly sequence in Nazi anti-Jewish policy, directed from a very early point to the goal of mass murder.”\nMichael Marrus, historian, The Holocaust in History, 1989",
