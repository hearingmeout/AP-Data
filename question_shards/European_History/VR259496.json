    "description": "Directions: This question is based on the seven accompanying documents. The documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise.\n\nDocument 1\n\nSource: Christopher Columbus, Genoese explorer in service of the Spanish monarchy, report on his first voyage, sent to the king of Spain and royal officials, 1493\n\nIn that island which we named Hispaniola [in the Caribbean], there are mountains of very great size and beauty, vast plains, groves, and very fruitful fields, admirably adapted for farming, pasture, and settlement…moreover it abounds in various kinds of spices, gold, and other metals.\n\nIn all these islands there is no difference of manners, or of language, but they all clearly understand each other, a circumstance very advantageous for the completion of what I conceive to be the principal wish of our most serene King, namely, the conversion of these people to the holy faith of Christ.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Miguel de Estete, Spanish soldier, account of the Spanish conquest of Peru, 1533\n\nWe asked why they cared about such a crude and ungainly idol. They were astounded at our daring and defended the honor of their god and said that he was Pachacamac, the Creator, who healed illnesses. From what we could learn, this devil appeared to their priests in that building and spoke with them, and people came with petitions and offerings from the entire kingdom.\n\nSeeing the evil there and the blindness of all those people, we gathered together their leaders and enlightened them. In the presence of all, the building was opened and torn down, and with much solemnity, a tall cross was raised over the spot which for so long the devil had claimed as his own.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Spanish explorer, account of his journeys, 1542\n\nAll the inhabitants of Culiacán [in northern Mexico] who were friendly to the Christians and had heard of our arrival, came to visit, bearing beads and feathers. We commanded them to build churches and to bring their principal men to be baptized.\n\nThen our commander made a solemn covenant with God not to enslave any of that region to whom we had guaranteed safety.\n\nIndians came to us shortly with news that many people had returned from the mountains and were living again in the valleys; that they had built churches with crosses and were doing everything we required.\n\nWe thank our merciful God that, in the days of Your Majesty's dominion, these nations are all coming voluntarily to Him who created and redeemed us.\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Francisco Xeres, secretary to Francisco Pizarro, leader of the Spanish conquest of Peru, account of the 1532 meeting with the Inca emperor Atahualpa, 1547\n\nFriar Vicente advanced, with a cross in one hand and the Bible in the other and, going amongst the Inca troops, came to Atahualpa and said: “I am a Priest of God, and I teach Christians the things of God, and in like manner I come to teach you. I beseech you to be their friend, for such is God's will.”\n\nAtahualpa opened the Bible himself, and, without any astonishment at the letters and paper, as had been shown by other Indians, he threw it away. Then he answered with much scorn: “I know well how you have behaved on the road, how you have treated my chiefs, and taken goods from my storehouses. . . . I will not leave this place until they return everything to me.”\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: Michele Soriano, Venetian ambassador to Spain, confidential report to the Venetian government, 1559\n\nThe king of Spain gets one-fourth of the whole sum of precious metals [extracted from the Americas], but this is not more than four or five hundred thousand ducats per year [although it is often believed to be much more]. Nor is it likely that this revenue will remain even at this figure. Great quantities of gold and silver are no longer found upon the surface of the earth, and to mine below the surface requires greater effort, skill, and expense. Also, the Indians cannot be forced to mine, because the king has freed them from all obligations of service as soon as they accept the Christian religion. Because of this, it is necessary to acquire slaves from Africa.\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: Unknown Native American artist, portrayal of Hernan Cortés, leader of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, with a column of Spanish soldiers and conscripted Native American laborers, late 1500s\n\nThe banner has a symbol representing the Holy Spirit, part of the Christian trinity. The image appeared in a pictorial record of Aztec history created after the Spanish conquest.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Antonio de Berrio, description of an expedition into the interior of northern South America, 1593\n\nThe territory is healthy, of moderate temperature, peaceful, fertile, with the fruits of the Indies, much game and fish. Among all the new lands which I have seen, it is the most appropriate for recreation and pleasure. It is extremely rich in gold, and the inhabitants wanted to show me where they mine it.\n\nBut in order not to seem greedy, I insisted that my expedition was not undertaken to seek gold but to establish friendship. I only brought back seventeen pieces of worked gold which I sent to the king, and three hatchets of stone which show that, though these people are sometimes barbarous, they do not lack the skills to stop them being so.",
