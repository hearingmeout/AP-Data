    "description": "“In July, I went to Milan at the request of the illustrious Duke Galeazzo to stand godfather to his firstborn child. . . . We paid our due to the Duchess by presenting her with a necklace of gold and a large diamond, which cost near 2,000 [Venetian] ducats. The consequence was that the said Lord desired that I should stand godfather to all his children. . . .\nTo do as others had done, I held a joust in the Piazza Santa Croce [in Florence] at great expense and with great pomp. I think we spent about 10,000 ducats on that and, although I was not highly versed in the use of weapons and the delivery of blows, the first prize was given to me. . . .\nPiero, our father, departed this life on July 2. . . . I find that from 1434 till now [our family] has spent large sums of money, as appear in a small notebook [found among my father’s possessions]. Incredible are the sums written down. They amount to 663,755 [Florentine] florins given for alms, buildings, and taxes, let alone other expenses. But I do not regret this, for though many would consider it better to have that sum in their purse, I consider that it gave great honor to our State, and I think the money was well expended.”\nLorenzo de’ Medici, Florentine statesman, journal entries, 1469",
