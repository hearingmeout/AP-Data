    "description": "Source 1\n\n“The Berlin Industrial Fair in 1950 was most impressive because it showed large machines being produced by the West at a time when Eastern factories were suffering from dismantling by the Soviets and when raw materials in the East were in extreme shortage. Since that time, however, the Eastern emphasis on heavy machinery and production goods has brought about a changed situation. It is particularly appropriate at this time, therefore, to show West Berliners, and more especially East Zone and [Soviet] Sector visitors, the progress made in the West in developing consumer goods designed to raise the standard of living of the average family.”\nUnited States Department of State memo regarding the Berlin industrial fair, November 1952\n\nSource 2\n\n“For the first time in modern British history the working-class home, as well as the middle-class home, has become a place that is warm, comfortable, and able to provide its own fireside entertainment—in fact, pleasant to live in. The outcome is a working-class way of life which is decreasingly concerned with activities outside the house or with values wider than those of the family.”\nMark Abrams, “The Home-Centered Society,” The Listener, magazine of the British Broadcasting Corporation, November 1959",
