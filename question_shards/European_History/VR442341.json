    "description": "“[Working in the coal mines] women’s nature becomes impregnated with a coarseness altogether too masculine. [She acquires] the most detestable education, the grossest language, the basest manners. Woman goes there to cast off the principal qualities that distinguish her sex; there she contracts men’s habits, the allures of independence and liberty which later become the cause of disputes, of quarrels, and even of acts of violence. Earning a rather high wage, she becomes extravagant, and no longer knows the value of money. Habituated to going out every day, her house’s interior becomes a burden.”\nDr. Jean-François Vleminckx, report to the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, 1870",
    "question": "Vleminckx’ perspective in the report best demonstrates which of the following social developments of the nineteenth century?",
