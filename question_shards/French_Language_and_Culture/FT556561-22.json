    "question": "Directions: You have 2 minutes to read the directions for this task. This part requires spoken responses. Your cue to start or stop speaking will always be this tone. Your spoken responses will be recorded. Your score will be based on what you record. It is important that you speak loudly enough and clearly enough for the machine to record what you say. You will be asked to start, pause, and stop your recorder at various points during the exam. Follow the directions and start, pause, or stop the recorder only when you are told to do so. Remember that the tone is a cue only to start or stop speaking—not to start or stop the recorder. You will participate in a conversation. First, you will have 1 minute to read a preview of the conversation, including an outline of each turn in the conversation. Afterward, the conversation will begin, following the outline. Each time it is your turn to speak, you will have 20 seconds to record your response. You should participate in the conversation as fully and appropriately as possible. Thème du cours: La famille et la communauté Vous aurez 1 minute pour lire l’introduction.
