Identify the world region on the map with the highest rates of natural increase. Using the region identified in part A, explain THREE factors that contribute to high population growth rates. Describe ONE economic incentive that a country with a high population growth rate could use to decrease population growth, and identify ONE potential impact of this strategy. Describe ONE social program or policy that a country with a high population growth rate could use to decrease population growth, and identify ONE potential impact of this strategy.",
