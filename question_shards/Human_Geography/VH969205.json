      {
        "label": "Farmers in less developed countries who had previously grown only one crop were forced to grow multiple crops, leading to increased production costs and fewer exports from less developed countries to more developed countries.",

        "label": "The overuse of expanded irrigation systems resulted in flooding and damage to export crops in less developed countries, which led to higher food prices in more developed countries.",
