    "question": "During the Green Revolution, agricultural practices from more developed countries diffused to less developed countries in Asia and Africa. Which of the following best explains the Green Revolution's highly variable level of success in increasing agricultural yields?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The increased yield of the Green Revolution in sub-Saharan Africa decreased the incidence of famine, but the program was unsuccessful in India because of poor soil quality.",

      {
        "label": "Small-scale farmers in Asia often lacked the resources necessary to acquire the hybrid seeds and the chemical inputs to grow them, leaving large gaps in the success of the Green Revolution outside of urban cores.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The Green Revolution was not successful in China because the strain of rice produced was prone to widespread crop failures, and China dropped out of the program.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Rice production surpassed all other crop production in sub-Saharan Africa, but corn production in Mexico was less successful because of the negative impact on the environment.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Persistent famine has occurred in India since new technologies associated with the Green Revolution were implemented because only the wealthy could afford the increased cost of the improved strains of rice.",
