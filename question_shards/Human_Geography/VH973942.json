Describe the spatial pattern of orange cultivation in Florida. Explain ONE barrier to agricultural development that prevents counties in South Florida from producing oranges as a crop. Explain ONE barrier to agricultural development that prevents counties in North Florida from producing oranges as a crop. In the world map the United States appears to be a large producer of oranges. Explain how the world map misrepresents the scale of production for the cultivation of oranges in the United States. Using the maps explain how oranges, as a global food source, are part of a commodity chain within multinational agribusiness corporations.",
