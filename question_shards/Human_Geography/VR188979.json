    "question": "As a country’s economy changes over time, its total fertility rate (TFR) can also change. Governments can attempt to affect the total fertility rate through laws or policies. Define the concept of total fertility rate. Describe ONE difference between the total fertility rate and the rate of natural increase. Explain ONE way the total fertility rate changes as a country shifts from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing-based economy. Explain how access to education for women in less developed countries is likely to affect the total fertility rate. Explain the degree to which access to women’s health care is likely to affect the total fertility rate in more developed countries. Explain ONE economic reason why governments enact pronatalist policies. Explain ONE way in which a government may influence an individual’s family planning decisions by implementing a pronatalist policy.",
