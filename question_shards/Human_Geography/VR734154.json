Identify the crop listed in the table that has diffused the least from its hearth of domestication to the countries listed in the table. Explain how food preferences can be a culture trait. Explain how the Columbian Exchange contributed to a crop’s diffusion beyond its hearth of domestication. Explain how the data in the table support the concept of a crop’s consumption pattern being the result of globalization. Explain why a crop may be farmed intensively in a less developed country and be farmed extensively in a more developed country. Explain ONE way the global supply chain links crops such as those listed in the table to consumers in other countries.",
