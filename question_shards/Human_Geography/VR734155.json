Explain ONE way education infrastructure affects a region’s potential for high-technology development. Explain how the pattern shown on the map resembles the galactic city model. Explain ONE way local economic changes may be a result of deindustrialization. Explain how the products and services listed in the table demonstrate that this economy has moved into the quaternary sector. The map focuses on a regional scale. Explain a possible limitation of drawing country scale conclusions from a regional scale map.",
