Explain ONE reason why increasing women’s access to education is likely to affect a country’s total fertility rate. SDG 8 is to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.” Explain ONE way in which a country’s development of ecotourism might affect economic growth. Using data from the table, explain how access to clean-burning fuels for people’s homes relates to the life expectancy of a country’s population.
