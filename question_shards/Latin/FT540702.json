    "question": "Three blocks of masses m, 3m, and 2m resting on a frictionless horizontal surface are connected to identical ideal springs, as shown above. A force of magnitude F directed to the left is then applied to the left end of spring A. Which spring is stretched the most when the blocks are all moving with the same acceleration?",
