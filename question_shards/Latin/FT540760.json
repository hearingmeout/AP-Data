    "question": "A block of mass mB is being pulled up a ramp by a hanging object of mass mH, as shown in the figure above. The blocks are attached to each other by a light string that passes over a pulley of negligible mass and friction. Both the block and the hanging object are moving at constant speed, and the angle of the ramp with the horizontal is θ . The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the ramp is μκ .(a) On the dots below, which represent the block and the hanging object, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the block and the hanging object. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the appropriate dot.(b) Derive an expression for the mass mH of the hanging object. Express your answer in terms of mB, θ , μκ , and physical constants, as appropriate. If you need to draw anything other than what you have shown in part (a) to assist in your solution, use the space below. Do NOT add anything to the figure in part (a).It is determined that mB = 2.0 kg, θ = 30° , and μk = 0.10. While the block is moving up the ramp and the hanging object is moving downward, the string is suddenly cut.(c)Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration of the block immediately after the string is cut.What is the direction of the acceleration of the block immediately after the string is cut? ____ Up the ramp _____ Down the ramp ____ No direction, because the acceleration is zero Determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the hanging object immediately after the string is cut.(d) Assume the block is moving up the ramp at 2.0 m/s when the string is cut. Calculate how far the block travels up the ramp from the time the string is cut until the block stops, assuming there is sufficient distance on the ramp.",
