    "question": "A uniform rod of mass M and length L is pivoted at a point a distance L/3 from the top end, as shown below. The rod is pulled back so that it makes a small angle with the vertical and is then released. (a) Using integral calculus, show that the rotational inertia for the rod around its pivot is ML2/9. (b) Using Newton’s 2nd law in rotational form, write but do NOT solve a differential equation in terms of M, L, and physical constants, as appropriate, that can be used to determine the angular displacement theta as a function of time t.
