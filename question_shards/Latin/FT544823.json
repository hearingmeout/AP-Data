Your bass line should make melodic sense in relation to the given soprano line. Give melodic interest to the bass line. Vary the motion of the bass line in relation to the soprano. Use mostly quarter notes, but you may use note values ranging from half notes to eighth notes. Your bass line and chord choices should make harmonic sense with the melody.
