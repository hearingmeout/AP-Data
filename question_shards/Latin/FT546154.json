    "question": "A ball initially moves horizontally with velocity vi , as shown above. It is then struck by a stick. After leaving the stick, the ball moves vertically with a velocity v𝑓 , which is smaller in magnitude than vi . Which of the following vectors best represents the direction of the average force that the stick exerts on the ball?",
