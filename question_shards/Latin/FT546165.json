    "question": "Two balls are on a frictionless horizontal tabletop. Ball X initially moves at 10 meters per second, as shown in Figure I above. It then collides elastically with identical ball Y, which is initially at rest. After the collision, ball X moves at 6 meters per second along a path at 53° to its original direction, as shown in Figure II above. Which of the following diagrams best represents the motion of ball Y after the collision?",
