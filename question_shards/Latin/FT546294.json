    "question": "The graph above shows the force of gravity on a small mass as a function of its distance R from the center of the Earth of radius Re, if the Earth is assumed to have a uniform density. The work done by the force of gravity when the small mass approaches Earth from far away and is placed into a circular orbit of radius R2 is best represented by the area under the curve between",
