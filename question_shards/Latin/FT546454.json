    "question": "A small particle starts from rest from the origin of an xy-coordinate system and travels in the xy-plane. Its acceleration in the x-direction is 2.0 m/s2 , and its acceleration in the y-direction is 1.0 m/s2 . What is the x-coordinate of the particle when its y-coordinate is 12 m?",
