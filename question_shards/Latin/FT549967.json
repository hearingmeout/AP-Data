    "question": "Block 1 of mass m1 is placed on block 2 of mass m2, which is then placed on a table. String connecting block 2 to a hanging mass M passes over a pulley attached to one end of the table, as shown above. The mass and friction of the pulley are negligible. The coefficients of friction between blocks 1 and 2 and between block 2 and the tabletop are nonzero and are given in the following table. Express your answers in terms of the masses, coefficients of friction, and g, the acceleration due to gravity. a. Suppose that the value of M is small enough that the blocks remain at rest when released. For each of the following forces, determine the magnitude of the force and draw a vector on the block provided to indicate the direction of the force if it is nonzero. The normal force N1 exerted on block 1 by block 2 The friction force f1 exerted on block 1 by block 2 The force T exerted on block 2 by the string The normal force N2 exerted on block 2 by the tabletop The friction force f2 exerted on block 2 by the tabletop b. Determine the largest value of M for which the blocks can remain at rest. c. Now suppose that M is large enough that the hanging block descends when the blocks are released. Assume that blocks 1 and 2 are moving as a unit (no slippage). Determine the magnitude a of their acceleration. d. Now suppose that M is large enough that as the hanging block descends, block 1 is slipping on block 2. Determine each of the following. The magnitude a1 of the acceleration of block 1 The magnitude a2 of the acceleration of block 2",
