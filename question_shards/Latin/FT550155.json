    "question": "A crash test car of mass 1,000 kg moving at constant speed of 12 m/s collides completely inelastically with an object of mass M at time t = 0. The object was initially at rest. The speed v in m/s of the car-object system after the collision is given as a function of time t in seconds by the expression <math> <mrow> <mi>v</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mfrac> <mn>8</mn> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>+</mo> <mn>5</mn> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math> Calculate the mass M of the object. Assuming an initial position of x = 0, determine an expression for the position of the car-object system after the collision as a function of time t. Determine an expression for the resisting force on the car-object system after the collision as a function of time t. Determine the impulse delivered to the car-object system from t = 0 to t = 2.0 s.",
