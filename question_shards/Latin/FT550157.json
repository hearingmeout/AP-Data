The glider is acted on by the force determined in part (b). Your goal is to determine experimentally the validity of your theoretical calculation in part (c). (d) From the list below, select the additional equipment you will need from the laboratory to do your experiment by checking the line next to each item. If you need more than one of an item, place the number you need on the line.

You may include a labeled diagram of your setup if it will clarify your procedure.",
