    "question": "The torsion pendulum shown above consists of a disk of rotational inertia I suspended by a flexible rod attached to a rigid support. When the disk is twisted through a small angle θ , the twisted rod exerts a restoring torque 𝜏 that is proportional to the angular displacement: 𝜏 = –𝛽θ , where 𝛽 is a constant. The motion of a torsion pendulum is analogous to the motion of a mass oscillating on a spring. In terms of the quantities given above, write but do NOT solve the differential equation that could be used to determine the angular displacement θ of the torsion pendulum as a function of time t. Using the analogy to a mass oscillating on a spring, determine the period of the torsion pendulum in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants, as appropriate. To determine the torsion constant 𝛽 of the rod, disks of different, known values of rotational inertia are attached to the rod, and the data below are obtained from the resulting oscillations. c. On the graph below, plot the data points. Draw a straight line that best represents the data. d. Determine the equation for your line. e. Calculate the torsion constant 𝛽 of the rod from your line. f. What is the physical significance of the intercept of your line with the vertical axis?",
