    "question": "A cart of mass m is pulled along a level dynamics track as shown above. A force sensor is attached to the cart with a string and used to measure the horizontal force exerted on the cart to the right. A motion sensor is used to measure the acceleration of the cart with the positive direction toward the right. Friction is not negligible. On the dot below, which represents the cart, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the cart. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the dot. A student pulls the force sensor with a constant force, and the cart accelerates. This is repeated for several trials, with a different constant force used for each trial. The data are recorded in the table below. On the grid below, plot data points for the acceleration of the cart as a function of the force sensor reading. Clearly scale all axes. Draw a straight line that best represents the data. Using the straight line from the graph, calculate the mass of the cart. Using the straight line from the graph, determine the magnitude of the force of friction. The above experiment is repeated by using a constant force sensor reading of 0.45 N. The cart starts from rest at time t = 0 s and is pulled for a time of 2.0 s along the dynamics track. Determine the acceleration of the cart. The string breaks at time t = 2.0 s. Calculate the time it takes for the cart to stop after the string breaks. The experiment and analysis in parts a. and b. are repeated with a cart that has the same mass but a greater force of friction. Will the slope of your new line be greater than, less than, or equal to the slope of your line in part b.i.? _____Greater than _____Less than _____Equal to Will the horizontal intercept of your new line be greater than, less than, or equal to the horizontal intercept of your line in part b.i.? _____Greater than _____Less than _____Equal to",
