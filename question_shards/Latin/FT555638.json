While a formal essay is not required, it is not enough to answer a question by merely listing facts. Illustrate your answers with substantive geographic examples where appropriate. Use the concept of land rent (sometimes called bid-rent) to explain the profile of residential population density shown on the graph. Using the population pyramids labeled X and Y, identify and explain TWO differences in the demographic composition between the pyramids. Explain the relationship between the demographic differences identified in part B, above, and residential land use patterns at point X and point Y, respectively, in the graph of population density.",
