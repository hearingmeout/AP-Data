    "question": "Directions: You have 20 minutes to answer the following question. It is suggested that you take a few minutes of this time to plan and outline your answer. Illustrate your essay with substantive examples where appropriate. It is not enough to answer a question by merely listing facts. You should present a cogent argument based on your critical analysis of the questions posed and your understanding of geography. Over the last 150 years, Europe has changed from a source to a destination region for international migration. Use the demographic transition model to explain briefly Europe’s development as a source of international migrants between 1800 and 1920. Identify and briefly explain ONE factor other than demographic transition that was responsible for Europe’s development as a source of migrants to the United States between 1800 and 1920. Briefly explain how THREE aspects of the demographic transition model account for Europe’s transformation into a destination region for migrants from North Africa between 1960 and 2000.",
