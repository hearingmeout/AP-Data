    "question": "Directions: You have 25 minutes to answer the following question. It is suggested that you take up to 5 minutes of this time to plan and outline your answer. Rostow’s five-stage model of economic growth and the core-periphery concept of Wallerstein’s three-part world system theory are two of the more common economic development models. Identify and compare three differences between the stages of economic growth and the core-periphery model. Use one of the two models to explain the level of economic development in either Mexico or Brazil. Give two examples of how the core-periphery concept can be applied below the national scale.",
