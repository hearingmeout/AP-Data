    "question": "For centuries, sugar crystals were made from the evaporated juice of sugarcane, a plant grown only in tropical and subtropical climates. In the 1800s, industrial methods were developed to manufacture crystalline sugar from sugar beets. This allowed for large amounts of sugar to be produced in colder, temperate climate zones.\nWhich of the following geographic concepts best explains the ability of humans to use technology to overcome the limitations of climate and modify the landscape?",
