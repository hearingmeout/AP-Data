    "question": "Chinese porcelain was highly valued in Europe for its beauty, style, and durability. However, imported porcelain from China was very expensive. Crafters in Germany and England developed new methods of making porcelain using feldspar and bone rather than the kaolin that was used in China. This new porcelain was viewed as having similar quality to Chinese porcelain, and the new methods continued to be used in Europe.\nThis example describes what type of diffusion?",
