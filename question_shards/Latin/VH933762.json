Explain how the action described in Part A affects policymaking in Congress. Another group interested in conserving land in California supports the Democratic candidate in the election. Rather than having 140,000 members, the group is led by a few very wealthy families. Explain how this difference will likely affect the conservationist group’s strategy in the election.",
