    "question": "A rock is suspended from a horizontal support by a string, as shown above. An identical string is attached to the bottom of the rock. A person pulls the bottom string down, starting with a small force and increasing the force slowly until one of the strings breaks. Which of the following correctly indicates which string will break and gives an accurate justification for this claim?",

      {
