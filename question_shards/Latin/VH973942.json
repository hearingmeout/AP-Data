Describe ONE characteristic of specialty agriculture.\n\nDescribe the spatial pattern of orange cultivation in Florida.\n\nExplain ONE barrier to agricultural development that prevents counties in South Florida from producing oranges as a crop.\n\nExplain ONE barrier to agricultural development that prevents counties in North Florida from producing oranges as a crop.\n\nIn the world map the United States appears to be a large producer of oranges. Explain how the world map misrepresents the scale of production for the cultivation of oranges in the United States.\n\nUsing the maps explain how oranges, as a global food source, are part of a commodity chain within multinational agribusiness corporations.",
