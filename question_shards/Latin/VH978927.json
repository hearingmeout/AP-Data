    "description": "Crop production can be measured in yield, which is the average amount of a crop produced per unit of land in a single year. Yields are used to compare the level of productivity between different places. The maps show the change in tons of rice per acre of farmland between 1970 and 2015.",
    "question": "Identify the scales of analysis in the two maps shown.\n\nExplain why all of Southeast Asia is shaded in a single color in the world map, whereas Southeast Asian countries are shaded differently in the regional map.\n\nDescribe what the rice production data for Southeast Asia and West Africa, where rice is traditionally grown, imply about the intensity of land use in these areas.\n\nDescribe ONE technological advancement that made the Green Revolution possible.\n\nUsing the data shown on the maps, explain how the Green Revolution affected farmers in less developed countries.\n\nExplain the degree to which mechanization changed rice production in less developed countries.\n\nExplain how the use of agricultural chemicals contributed to the change in rice production.",
