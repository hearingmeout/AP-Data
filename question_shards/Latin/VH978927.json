Explain why all of Southeast Asia is shaded in a single color in the world map, whereas Southeast Asian countries are shaded differently in the regional map. Describe what the rice production data for Southeast Asia and West Africa, where rice is traditionally grown, imply about the intensity of land use in these areas. Describe ONE technological advancement that made the Green Revolution possible. Using the data shown on the maps, explain how the Green Revolution affected farmers in less developed countries. Explain the degree to which mechanization changed rice production in less developed countries. Explain how the use of agricultural chemicals contributed to the change in rice production.",
