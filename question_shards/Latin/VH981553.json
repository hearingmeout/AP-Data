    "question": "An object is initially at rest at the origin of the <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-axis. A single conservative force is exerted on the object. The force <math alttext=\"F sub x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of position <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is shown in the graph provided. Which of the following sets of graphs best show the potential energy of the system and the kinetic energy of the object as the object moves away from the origin?",
