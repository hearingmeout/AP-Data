    "question": "Students in lab are attempting to determine the spring constant of a spring. They attach objects of varying masses <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to the end of the spring and measure the period of oscillation, <math alttext=\"T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, for each mass object. The data for <math alttext=\"T squared\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msup><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is shown in the graph the square of the period as a function of the mass, as shown. What is the approximate spring constant of the spring? Which of the following has the best-fit line that can be used to find the approximate value for the spring constant shown?",
