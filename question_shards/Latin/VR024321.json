    "question": "Two blocks rest on a table, as shown above. The bottom block is pulled to the right by an applied force <math alttext=\"vector F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow></mover></mrow></mstyle></math> that is strong enough so that the two blocks do not move together (i.e., they do not have the same acceleration or velocity). There is friction between the blocks, but the tabletop is frictionless. When the top block leaves the bottom block, where does it land and why?",
