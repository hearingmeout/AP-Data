Explain the process of diffusion by which the land survey method shown in Image 1 arrived in the St. Lawrence River valley.\n\nD. Explain how local-food movements in Oxfordshire may affect patterns of land use in this area.\n\nE. Explain ONE disadvantage of changing the scale of these images to 1:1,000,000 for interpreting rural land use patterns.",
