    "description": "GRAIN YIELDS IN POUNDS PER ACRE, FOR SELECTED REGIONS\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nThe graph shows global trends in agricultural productivity since 1960. In this graph, grain yields are measured in pounds per acre of farmland. Grains include crops such as rice, corn, and wheat.",
    "question": "A. Using information in the graph shown, compare the data trend from 1985 to 2000 for sub-Saharan Africa to the trend shown for the world.\n\nB. Using the data for ONE of the regions shown in the graph, explain why the trend may have an effect on the sizes of grain farms in developing countries.\n\nC. Explain the degree to which the changes in grain yields may affect rural populations in countries in stage 5 of the demographic transition.\n\nD. Explain ONE limitation of the data in showing the total volume of grain produced at the regional scale.",
