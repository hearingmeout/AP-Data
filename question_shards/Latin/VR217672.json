    "description": "GRAIN YIELDS IN POUNDS PER ACRE, FOR SELECTED REGIONS\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nThe graph shows global trends in agricultural productivity since 1960. In this graph, grain yields are measured in pounds per acre of farmland. Grains include crops such as rice, corn, and wheat.",
    "question": "A. Using information in the graph shown, compare the data trend from 1960 to 2015 for Latin America and the Caribbean to the trend shown for Europe.\n\nB. Using the data for ONE of the regions shown in the graph, explain why the trend may have an effect on the environmental carrying capacity of agricultural areas.\n\nC. Using the information in the graph, explain how changes in grain yields may affect rural populations in countries in stage 3 of the demographic transition.\n\nD. Explain ONE limitation of the data in showing regional patterns of consumption.",
