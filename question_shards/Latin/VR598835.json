    "question": "FOREST COVER AS A PERCENTAGE OF LAND AREA, 1990–2015 Source: World Bank The graph shows forest cover as a percentage of total land area from 1990 through 2015 for selected countries and the world. Describe ONE reason a country’s percentage of forest cover may change. Using the data shown in the graph, compare the trends in forest cover change between more developed countries and less developed countries from 1990 through 2015. Using the data shown in the graph, explain ONE reason for the global trend in forest cover over time. Explain the degree to which Wallerstein’s world system theory explains changes in the pattern of forest cover since 1990. Explain what the data shown on the graph imply about sources of energy in less developed countries. Explain how the global demand for ONE of the following commodities may be driving local changes in forest cover. 1. Palm oil 2. Soybeans 3. Beef Explain ONE consequence of forest cover change for environmental sustainability in more developed countries.",
