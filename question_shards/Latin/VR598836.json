    "question": "Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland differ politically and culturally. Starting in 1969, a series of walls, fences, and barriers known as “peace lines” were constructed to separate neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1999, The United Kingdom’s government transferred a wide range of powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, a regional parliament. Identify ONE type of cultural difference shown in Map 2. Describe ONE way that the United Kingdom illustrates the concept of a multinational state. Explain ONE possible benefit of devolution for Northern Ireland. Explain ONE way that the cultural pattern shown in Map 2 may act as a centrifugal force within Belfast. Explain how the cultural pattern shown in Map 2 reflects Hoyt’s sector model of urban form. Explain ONE reason why the construction of barriers such as peace lines in urban areas may cause populations to migrate within a city. Explain a possible limitation of using Map 1 to describe the political conflict on the island of Ireland.",
