    "question": "An object moves in one dimension along the <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math>-axis as described by the position versus time graph shown in the figure. During the time interval of the graph, how many times does the object change direction and what feature or features of the graph justifies this response?",
