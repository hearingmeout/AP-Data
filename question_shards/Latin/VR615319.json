    "question": "A wooden block is initially traveling upward along a rough inclined surface, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. The block continues to travel up the incline a short distance, and then reverses direction and travels down the incline as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. Which of the following pairs of free-body diagrams best represents the forces exerted on the block while it is traveling up the incline and traveling down the incline?",
