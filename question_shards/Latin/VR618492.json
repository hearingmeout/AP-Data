    "question": "A block is at rest on a desk’s horizontal surface. A student correctly identifies the forces exerted on the block as the force of Earth on the block and the force of the desk on the block. A book then is placed between the block and the desk. Which objects exert forces of equal magnitude on the block after the book has been introduced?",
