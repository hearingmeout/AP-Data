    "question": "In a second experimental trial, the wheel is initially rotating counterclockwise. A piece of clay that has the same mass as the wheel is traveling directly to the right at a speed of <math alttext=\"12 meters per second\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mtext>12</mtext><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>m</mtext><mo>/</mo><mtext>s</mtext></mstyle></math>, colliding with, and sticking to, the top of the outer rim of the wheel. Which of the following claims about the motion of the clay-wheel system is correct, and has correct reasoning to support that claim?",
