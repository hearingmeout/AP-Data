    "question": "The rate of natural increase (RNI), also known as the natural increase rate, helps geographers assess annual population growth or decline. Define the concept of RNI. Describe how a country may have a negative RNI. Compare ONE difference between RNI and the total fertility rate as indicators of population change. Explain ONE reason why RNI in urban areas may vary significantly from RNI in rural areas in the same country. Explain why there are often differences in doubling times between less developed countries and more developed countries. Explain ONE reason ethnonationalism might lead a government to promote pronatalist policies. Explain the degree to which a unitary government may be more effective than a federal government in enforcing antinatalist policies.",
