Explain how pastoral nomadism may affect the cultural landscape of the Sahel region. Explain ONE way mixed-crop farming could be affected by climatic conditions. Using the map and table, explain why expanding protected natural areas may affect the migration routes of nomadic herders in the Sahel region. Using the information in the table, explain why farmers’ increased use of irrigation may increase conflicts with nomadic herders. Explain the degree to which increased access to communication technologies may create cultural convergence among nomadic herders.",
