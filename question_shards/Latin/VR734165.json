    "description": "PASTORAL NOMADISM IN THE SAHEL REGION OF AFRICA\n\nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization\n\nThe Sahel is an environmental transition zone between the Sahara desert and the wet tropical forest regions of Africa. The landscape is a semiarid grassland, having distinct dry and wet seasons, and the region is interspersed with shrubs and small woodlands.\n\nSOURCES OF TENSION RELATED TO PASTORAL NOMADISM\n\nGroups\n Potential Sources of Tension\n\nNomadic herders versus crop farmers\n • Damage to fields by migrating herds • Overgrazing by migrating herds• Competition for access to water• Increasing size of crop farms\n\nNomadic herders versus conservation organizations\n • Grazing of protected areas• Degradation of natural habitats\n\nNomadic herders versus government officials\n • Failure to follow regulations on cross-border migration• Activities such as smuggling foreign goods\n\nSource: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nPastoral nomadism is widely practiced in the Sahel region of Africa. The map and table provide information about spatial patterns and social tensions associated with this type of agriculture.",
