Describe ONE political pull factor that would draw migrants who are over age 65 over long distances to the location shown in the pyramid. C. Explain ONE reason why the population for males aged over 80 can be a slightly larger group than the men aged 75 to 79 population. D. Explain the degree to which the population pyramid shown can be used to predict local needs for emergency services.",
