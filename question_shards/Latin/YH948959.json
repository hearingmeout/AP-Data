    "question": "In the 1880s, European powers began invading and occupying the interior areas of Africa, which were inhabited by a variety of diverse culture groups. By 1900, European countries had claimed nearly 90 percent of African territory and redrawn the political boundaries of Africa, many of which remain today. Describe the type of political boundaries shown in Map 1. Describe ONE way that the European colonial boundaries shown in Map 1 differ from the African cultural boundaries shown in Map 2. Explain ONE political outcome for present-day Africans as a result of the European colonial boundaries. Describe ONE way that European colonization of Africa reflected the concept of ethnocentrism. Explain ONE way that the political boundaries shown in Map 1 illustrate a European colonial emphasis on resource extraction. Explain the degree to which colonization affected the languages spoken in present-day Africa. Explain a possible limitation of using Map 2 to understand the geography of religion in present-day Africa.",
