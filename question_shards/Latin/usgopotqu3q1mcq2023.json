    "question": "The Supreme Court addressed policies related to government hiring practices and race in City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Company. In 1983, the local government in Richmond, Virginia enacted a regulation that required companies that received contracts from the city to subcontract at least 30 percent of that work to minority business enterprises. When the J.A. Croson Company lost a contract due to this regulation, they sued the city. The court found in favor of the business, reasoning that racial quotas were not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and were an impermissible requirement for employment Which of the following issues was the primary concern in City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Company?",
