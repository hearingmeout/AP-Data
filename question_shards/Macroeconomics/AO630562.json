(i) Based on the model, identify the stage in the demographic transition with the greatest change in crude birth rate. (ii) Based on the model, describe the relationship between the crude death rate and the crude birth rate that led to the trend in total population in stage 2. (iii) Explain one likely social or economic cause for the change in the crude birth rate illustrated in stage 3.",
