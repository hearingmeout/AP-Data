    "question": "In the 1970s, the amount of industrial pollution decreased and the trees began to return to their preindustrial appearance. Which of the following graphs best demonstrates the change in the frequencies of light-colored moths and dark-colored moths in the population from 1950 to 2000? The dark-colored moths are represented with a solid line and the light-colored moths are represented with a dashed line.",

The vertical axis is labeled Percentage of Moths Captured, and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The dark-colored moths are represented by the first curve, and the light-colored moths are represented by the second curve. The curve representing dark-colored moths is a straight horizontal line that passes through 95 percent in 1950, and 95 percent in 2000. The curve representing light-colored moths begins at approximately 4 percent in 1940, moves downward and to the right until it reaches approximately 1 percent in 150. It then remains relatively steady until it reaches 3 percent in 1975. The curve then moves steeply upward, intersecting the first curve at 95 percent in 2005, and then continues upward.",
