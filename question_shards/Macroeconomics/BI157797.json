    "question": "Scientific evidence shows a direct relationship between sea level and the global mean atmospheric temperature at Earth’s surface. Increases in the global mean atmospheric temperature during the past century have been accompanied by a gradual increase in sea level; currently the average rate of increase in sea level is 3.0 mm/yr. Additional increases in sea level are expected during the next century as global mean atmospheric temperatures continue to rise. These increases in sea level will affect coastal ecosystems as well as human activity along coastal margins.(a) Based on the rate cited above, calculate the expected increase in sea level, in meters, during the next 50 years.(b) Identify TWO phenomena that result from an increase in global mean atmospheric temperature and that contribute to increases in sea level. For each phenomenon that you identify, explain how it causes sea level to increase.(c) Describe TWO environmental impacts that increasing sea level will have on an estuarine ecosystem such as those in the Mississippi Delta, Chesapeake Bay, and San Francisco Bay.(d) Although sea level has been rising for over a century, human populations in coastal areas have increased dramatically during this period.Describe one negative economic impact that an increase in sea level will have on people who live along a coastline.Describe TWO viable strategies that governments could use to discourage people from moving to coastal areas.",
