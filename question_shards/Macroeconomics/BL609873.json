    "question": "Dams are built by humans for various purposes including hydroelectric power generation and control of downstream flooding. (a) Explain how electricity is generated at a hydroelectric dam.(b) Identify TWO economic benefits, other than hydroelectric power generation and control of downstream flooding, associated with dams. (c) Describe one ecological benefit of seasonal flooding of the floodplain of a free-flowing river. (d) Some dams have been removed from rivers. Explain how removal of a dam can benefit fish populations. Describe one negative environmental consequence of removing a dam from a river (other than effects on fish populations). (e) Dams are also built by beavers, a keystone species in some North American ecosystems. (i) Define keystone species.(ii) Describe how dams built by beavers can make beavers a keystone species in some ecosystems.",
