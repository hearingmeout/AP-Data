    "question": "Directions: Read the following article from the Fremont Examiner. (a) Support Dr. Tate's assertion that \"the leaf litter is critical to the survival of local species of forest plants.\" Include in your discussion the roles of leaf litter in a deciduous forest ecosystem. (b) Describe THREE abiotic changes that would be likely to result if the exotic worms consumed all the leaf litter in a single year. (c) For one of the changes you identified in part (b), explain how the change could set the stage for the takeover of Japanese stilt grass or other exotic species. (d) Design a controlled experiment to determine whether the worms, in fact, do change the forest ecosystem. Identify the environmental factor you will measure, and include the specific hypothesis you will test and the data you will collect.",
