    "description": "Directions: The following question(s) refer to the graph below.\n\nA series of experiments was designed to test the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the productivity of polar phytoplankton. Samples of these single-celled organisms were placed in four tanks, which were exposed to ambient natural solar radiation and to three modifications of ambient radiation. The design of the experiments is shown in the table below, along with measurements of photosynthesis in each tank.",
