    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume that Doorland’s economy is currently in equilibrium at the full-employment level of real gross domestic product and the banking system has limited reserves.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of aggregate demand and aggregate supply showing each of the following in Doroland.\n\nOutput level\n\nPrice level\n\nJapan is a major importer of Doorland's products. Assume that the Japanese economy goes into a recession.\n\nExplain the impact of the Japanese recession on Doorland's equilibrium output and price levels.\n\nShow these effects on your graph in part (a).\n\nAssume that the central bank of Doorland takes action to curb the effects of the Japanese recession on Doorland’s economy.\n\nWhat open-market operation would the central bank undertake?\n\nUse a correctly labeled graph of the money market to show how the central bank's policy action will affect the nominal interest rate.\n\nExplain how the change in the nominal interest rate in part (c) (ii) will affect aggregate demand, price level, and real output in Doorland.\n\nDefine the real interest rate.\n\nIndicate the effect of the open-market operation you identified in part (c) (i) on the real interest rate in Doorland.",
