    "description": "Assume that the economy of Hopeton is currently in long-run equilibrium, with a natural rate of unemployment equal to 5 percent and an inflation rate of 2 percent.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of the short-run Phillips curve, and label the curve as “SRPC.” Indicate the point on the SRPC corresponding to the current unemployment and inflation rates, labeled as “R.”\n\nOn your graph in part (a), draw the long-run Phillips curve, and label it as “LRPC.”\n\nAssume that the government of Hopeton increases spending to finance repairs and maintenance of the country’s infrastructure. How will such an increase in spending affect unemployment and inflation in the short run? Explain.\n\nShow on your graph in part (a) the new point on the SRPC corresponding to the results you stated in part (c), labeled as “S.”\n\nFollowing the increase in government spending, workers demand and receive a higher wage. What happens to the SRPC as a result of the higher wage? Explain.",
