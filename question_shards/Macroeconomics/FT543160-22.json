    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume the economy of Andersonland is in a long-run equilibrium with full employment. In the short run, nominal wages are fixed.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of short-run aggregate supply, long-run aggregate supply, and aggregate demand. Show each of the following.\n\nEquilibrium output, labeled Y1\n\nEquilibrium price level, labeled PL1\n\nAssume that there is an increase in exports from Andersonland. On your graph in part (a), show the effect of higher exports on the equilibrium in the short run, labeling the new equilibrium output and price level Y2 and PL2, respectively.\n\nBased on your answer in part (b), what is the impact of higher exports on real wages in the short run? Explain.\n\nAs a result of the increase in exports, export-oriented industries in Andersonland increase expenditures on new container ships and equipment.\n\nWhat component of aggregate demand will change?\n\nWhat is the impact on the long-run aggregate supply? Explain.",
