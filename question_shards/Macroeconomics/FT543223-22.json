    "description": "Country A and Country B produce the same two products, hammocks and looms. Country A can produce a maximum of 60 hammocks or 40 looms, while Country B can produce a maximum of 40 hammocks or 20 looms.\n\nWhat is the opportunity cost to produce a loom in terms of hammocks in Country A?\n\nWhich country, if either, has a comparative advantage in producing looms? Explain.\n\nInternationally, if 1 loom is traded for 1.75 hammocks, who will benefit from trading: Country A only, Country B only, both countries, or neither country?\n\nAssume there is international trade.\n\nCan a country produce beyond its production possibilities curve (PPC) ?\n\nCan a country consume beyond its PPC?",
