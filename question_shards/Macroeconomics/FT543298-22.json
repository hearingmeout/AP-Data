    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis.\n\nThe simplified T-account (balance  sheet) for Zenith Bank in the country of Everland is shown below. Assume the banking system in Everland has limited reserves and the reserve requirement is 20 percent.\n\nCalculate the maximum amount by which Zenith Bank can increase its loans. Show your work.\n\nBased on your answer in part (a), calculate the maximum possible increase in Everland’s money supply. Show your work.\n\nIdentify one reason that Everland’s money supply may expand by a smaller amount than the amount you identified in part (b).\n\nAssume the central bank of Everland purchases $10 million in government securities from the public. If the public deposits the $10 million in Zenith Bank, by how much will Zenith Bank’s required reserves change as a result of the new deposit?\n\nWhat will happen to the price of bonds as a result of the central bank’s purchase of government securities described in part (d) ?",
