    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nIn a country in which the banking system has limited reserves, the central bank can influence the supply of money.\n\nAssume that the central bank targets a lower policy rate.\n\nWhat open market operation can the central bank use to achieve the lower target?\n\nGiven your answer to part (a)(i), what will happen to the price of government bonds?\n\nUsing a correctly labeled graph of the money market, show the effect of the open market operation from part (a)(i) on the nominal interest rate.\n\nAssume that the central bank buys government bonds from commercial banks. Based only on this transaction, will the level of required reserves in the commercial banks increase, decrease, or remain the same?\n\nAnother monetary policy action involves changing the discount rate. Define the discount rate.",
