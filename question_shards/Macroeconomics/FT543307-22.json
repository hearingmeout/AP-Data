    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nInflation and expected inflation are important determinants of economic activity.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of a short-run Phillips curve.\n\nUsing your graph in part (a), show the effect of an increase in the expected rate of inflation.\n\nWhat is the effect of the increase in the expected rate of inflation on the long-run Phillips curve?\n\nGiven the increase in the expected rate of inflation from part (b),\n\nwill the nominal interest rate on new loans increase, decrease, or remain unchanged?\n\nwill the real interest rate on new loans increase, decrease, or remain unchanged?\n\nAssume that the nominal interest rate is 8 percent. Borrowers and lenders expect the rate of inflation to be 3 percent, and the growth rate of real gross domestic product is 4 percent. Calculate the real interest rate.",
