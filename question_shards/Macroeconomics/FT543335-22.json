    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nSewell Bank has the simplified balance sheet below. Assume the banking system has limited reserves.\n\nBased on Sewell Bank’s balance sheet, calculate the required reserve ratio.\n\nSuppose that the central bank purchases $5,000 worth of bonds from Sewell Bank. What will be the change in the dollar value of each of the following immediately after the purchase?\n\nExcess reserves\n\nDemand deposit\n\nCalculate the maximum amount that the money supply can change as a result of the $5,000 purchase of bonds by the central bank. Show your work.\n\nWhen the central bank purchases bonds, what will happen to the price of bonds in the open market? Explain.\n\nSuppose that instead of the purchase of bonds by the central bank, an individual deposits $5,000 in cash into her checking (demand deposit) account. What is the immediate effect of the cash deposit on the M1 measure of the money supply?",
