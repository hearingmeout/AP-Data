    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe economy in Country X is in a recession, with real gross domestic product (GDP) $100 billion below full-employment output.\n\nDraw one correctly labeled graph of the short-run and long-run Phillips curves, labeling the current equilibrium point A.\n\nAssume that the government increases spending by $20 billion to stimulate economic activity. Assume that the marginal propensity to save is 0.25. Calculate the maximum total change in real GDP that could occur following the $20 billion increase in government spending.\n\nOn your graph in part (a), label the new equilibrium point B as a result of the increase in government spending.\n\nHad the government lowered personal income taxes by $20 billion instead of increasing spending by $20 billion, would the maximum total change in real GDP be greater than, smaller than, or the same as the one calculated in part (b) ?
