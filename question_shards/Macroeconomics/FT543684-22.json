    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe Bank of Uchenna has the following balance sheet.\n\nAssume that the reserve requirement ratio is 20 percent.\n\nCalculate the dollar value of the reserves that the Bank of Uchenna is required to hold.\n\nGiven the current reserves, calculate the maximum value of additional loans that the Bank of Uchenna can make.\n\nAssume that Elike raises $5,000 in cash from a yard sale and deposits the cash in his checking account at the Bank of Uchenna. By how much does the money supply immediately change as a result of Elike’s deposit?\n\nCalculate the maximum change in demand deposits in the banking system as a whole resulting from Elike’s deposit.\n\nIf the Bank of Uchenna is not meeting its reserve requirement, what action can it take to meet the reserve requirement without calling in loans or selling property?",
