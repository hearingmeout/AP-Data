    "description": "In answering the questions, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your result; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nOver the past two years, the unemployment rate in Country X has risen from 5 percent to 9 percent. As the leader of Country X, you have been presented with two policy options to address the unemployment problem.\n\nPolicy 1: Use tariffs and quotas to restrict imports and thus protect jobs in Country X.\n\nPolicy 2: Use monetary and fiscal policies to solve the unemployment problem without resorting to trade restrictions.\n\nExplain two disadvantages of selecting Policy 1.\n\nAssume that the banking system in Country X has ample reserves. Describe in detail one specific monetary policy action and one specific fiscal policy action you would take to reduce unemployment. Explain how each of these actions would affect each of the following in the short run.\n\nAggregate demand\n\nOutput and the price level\n\nReal interest rates\n\nIf the interest rate effects you identified in Part (b) continue in the long run, explain the impact of these effects on economic growth.",
