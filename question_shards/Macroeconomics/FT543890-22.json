    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume that the economy is operating below the full-employment level of output and that the government’s budget is balanced.\n\nUsing a correctly labeled aggregate demand and aggregate supply graph, show how an increase in government spending will affect each of the following in the short run.\n\nReal output\n\nPrice level\n\nExplain how this increase in government spending will affect each of the following in the short run.\n\nReal interest rates\n\nInvestment\n\nNow assume that instead of increasing government spending, the government decreases corporate-profits taxes. Using a correctly labeled aggregate demand and aggregate supply graph, show and explain how this decrease in corporate-profits taxes will affect each of the following.\n\nAggregate demand\n\nLong-run aggregate supply\n\nReal output\n\nPrice level\n\nAssume that this country produces two goods, X and Y. Draw a correctly labeled production possibilities curve for this economy. Now show on the graph how this decrease in corporate-profits taxes will affect this economy’s production possibilities curve.",
