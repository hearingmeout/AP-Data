    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume that two countries, Atlantis and Xanadu, have equal amounts of resources. Atlantis can produce 30 cars or 10 tractors or any combination, as shown by the line MN in the figure above. Xanadu can produce 20 cars or 40 tractors or any combination, as shown by the line PQ in the figure above.\n\nWhich country has an absolute advantage in the production of tractors? Explain how you determined your answer.\n\nWhich country has a comparative advantage in the production of cars? Using the concept of opportunity cost, explain how you determined your answer.\n\nIf the two countries specialize and trade with each other, which country will import cars? Explain why.\n\nIf the terms of trade are such that one car can be exchanged for one tractor, explain how Atlantis will benefit from such trade.",
