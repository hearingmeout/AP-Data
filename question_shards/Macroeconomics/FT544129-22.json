    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nInterest rates are important in explaining economic activity.\n\nUsing a correctly labeled graph of the money market, show how an increase in the income level will affect the nominal interest rate in the short run.\n\nUsing a correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market, show how a decision by households to increase saving for retirement will affect the real market interest rate in the short run.\n\nSuppose that the nominal interest rate has been 6 percent with no expected inflation. If inflation is now expected to be 2 percent, determine the value of each of the following.\n\nThe new nominal interest rate\n\nThe new real interest rate",
