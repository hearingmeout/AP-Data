    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe unemployment rate is an important indicator of the health of the United States economy.\n\nAssume that with the economy at full employment, the government implements an expansionary fiscal policy. How does the actual unemployment rate at the new short-run equilibrium compare with the natural rate of unemployment?\n\nAssume that a significant number of workers are involuntarily changed from full-time to part-time employment. Explain how this will affect the number of people who are officially classified as unemployed.\n\nAssume that the government reduces the level of unemployment compensation.\n\nExplain how this affects the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nUsing a correctly labeled graph, show how this affects the long-run Phillips curve.",
