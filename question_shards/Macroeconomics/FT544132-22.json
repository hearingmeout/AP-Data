    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe central bank in a country that has limited reserves in its banking system is considering implementing monetary policy.\n\nIf the central bank wants to lower the policy rate, what open-market operation would be appropriate?\n\nAssume that the open-market operation that you indicated in part (b) is equal to $10 million. If the required reserve ratio is 0.2, calculate the maximum change in the money supply throughout the banking system. Show your work.\n\nIndicate the effect of the open-market operation that you indicated in part (b) on the nominal interest rate.\n\nAssume that the central bank’s action results in some inflation. What would be the impact of the open-market operation on the real rate of interest? Explain.",
