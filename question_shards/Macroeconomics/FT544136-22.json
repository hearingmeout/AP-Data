    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe diagram above shows the production possibilities curves for two countries: Artland and Rayland. Using equal amounts of resources, Artland can produce 600 hats or 300 bicycles, whereas Rayland can produce 1,200 hats or 300 bicycles.\n\nCalculate the opportunity cost of a bicycle in Artland.\n\nIf the two countries specialize and trade, which country will import bicycles? Explain.\n\nIf the terms of trade are 5 hats for 1 bicycle, would trade be advantageous for each of the following?\n\nArtland\n\nRayland\n\nIf productivity in Artland triples, which country has the comparative advantage in the production of hats?",
