    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume that the United States economy is currently in a short-run equilibrium with the actual unemployment rate above the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nDraw a single correctly labeled graph with both the long-run Phillips curve and short-run Phillips curve. Label the current short-run equilibrium point P.\n\nAssuming no policy actions are taken, will the short-run Phillips curve shift to the right (upward), shift to the left (downward), or remain the same in the long run? Explain.\n\nAssume the banking system in the United States has ample reserves. If the Federal Reserve Bank wants to lower unemployment, what expansionary monetary policy should it use?\n\nHow will the monetary policy you identified in part (c) affect each of the following?\n\nFederal funds rate.\n\nReal interest rate in the short run.\n\nGiven your answer in part (d)(ii), what is the effect on real gross domestic product (GDP) in the short run? Explain.\n\nJapan and the United States are major trading partners. Indicate how the change in real GDP you identified in part (e) will affect the demand for the Japanese yen in the foreign exchange market.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of the foreign exchange market for the Japanese yen, showing the effect of the change in demand identified in part (f) on the value of the Japanese yen relative to the United States dollar.",
