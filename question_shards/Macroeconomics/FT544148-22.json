Explain.\n\nWho has the comparative advantage in producing donuts? Explain.\n\nAssume that John and Erica decide to specialize according to their comparative advantages and that one cupcake is exchanged for four donuts.\n\nIndicate whether or not specialization and trade are beneficial to John.\n\nIndicate whether or not specialization and trade are beneficial to Erica.\n\nAssume that Erica discovers a new cupcake production technique that will increase her daily production of cupcakes only. Using donuts on the horizontal axis, draw a correctly labeled production possibilities curve for Erica, before and after the technology change in cupcake production.",
