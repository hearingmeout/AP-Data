    "description": "Directions: Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is followed by five suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.\n\nThe following questions refer to the next:\n\nA laboratory experiment was done to show the effects of organic waste on the dissolved oxygen (DO) content in water. Five tanks were set up, each containing fresh water and a small amount of single-celled green algae. Specified amounts of organic waste were added to the tanks. The results below show the amount of DO in each tank after a period of one week.",
