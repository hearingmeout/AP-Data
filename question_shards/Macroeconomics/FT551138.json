    "description": "Directions: Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is followed by five suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.\nThe following questions refer to the following:\n\nThe data shown were collected in a laboratory experiment in which the effect of pH on the survival of water fleas (Daphnia pulex) was examined. In each trial, 40 live water fleas were added to a solution with the pH as indicated. After two hours, observations were made to determine the number of fleas remaining alive in the sample. Results are presented in the table and in graphical form above.",
