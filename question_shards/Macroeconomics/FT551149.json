    "question": "Directions: The suggested time is about 22 minutes for answering this question. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\nMatter is continually recycled between the biotic and abiotic components of Earth’s ecosystems in biogeochemical cycles. The various cycles differ from one another in several key aspects of their storage, conversion, and modes of transport.\n\nDescribe the critical processes by which nitrogen is cycled through the biotic and abiotic components of Earth’s ecosystems and identify the primary storage sink for nitrogen.\n\nExplain ONE major way in which the phosphorus cycle differs from the nitrogen cycle.\n\nIdentify EITHER one nitrogen compound OR one phosphorus compound that is considered a pollutant when released by human activity into the environment. For the compound you identified, describe the human activity and a specific environmental problem that results.\n\nDescribe ONE way in which humans have disrupted the natural cycling of carbon and TWO major environmental consequences of that disruption.",
