Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nUsing equal amounts of resources, the countries of Ashna and Luna can each produce any combination of food and machines described by their production possibilities curves above.\n\nWhich country has an absolute advantage in the production of machines? Explain.\n\nWhich country has an absolute advantage in the production of food? Explain.\n\nWhich country has a comparative advantage in the production of machines? Explain.\n\nWith trade between these two countries, which country will import food? Explain.\n\nGive an example of terms of trade acceptable to both countries.",
