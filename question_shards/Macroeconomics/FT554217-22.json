    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe table above gives the production alternatives of two nations that are producing cloth and food, using equal amounts of resources.\n\nCalculate the opportunity cost of producing a unit of cloth in Newland.\n\nCalculate the opportunity cost of producing a unit of food in Beeland.\n\nWhich nation has the comparative advantage in cloth production?\n\nWhich nation has the comparative advantage in food production?\n\nNow assume that the productivity of Beeland’s workers triples for each good.\n\nWhich country has a comparative advantage in food production?\n\nExplain how you determined your answer.",
