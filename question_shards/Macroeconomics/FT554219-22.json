    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nLabor productivity is output per unit of labor. An increase in labor productivity is a source of economic growth.\n\nIdentify two sources of increase in labor productivity.\n\nAssume that a country’s economy is at full employment. Productivity has been rising. Using a correctly labeled graph of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, show the long-run effect of the growth in productivity on each of the following.\n\nReal output\n\nPrice level\n\nAssume that the economy produces only two goods, good X and good Y. Using a correctly labeled production possibility diagram, show the effect of the increase in labor productivity",
