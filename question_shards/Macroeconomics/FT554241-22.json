    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume that a country’s economy is operating at less than full employment.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and show each of the following.\n\nLong-run aggregate supply curve\n\nCurrent output and price level\n\nAssume that policy makers take no policy action and that prices and wages are flexible. Explain what will happen to each of the following.\n\nShort-run aggregate supply\n\nEmployment\n\nNow assume that instead of taking no policy action, the government implements a special tax incentive to encourage individuals to increase saving for retirement. Draw a correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market. Show how the real interest rate is affected.\n\nGiven your answer in part (c), explain how aggregate supply is affected in the long run.",
