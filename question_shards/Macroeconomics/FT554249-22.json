    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nAssume that businesses are granted a tax credit on spending for machinery. Using a correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market, show the effect of the business sector’s response on the real interest rate.\n\nNow assume instead that the tax rate on interest income from household savings is lowered and there is no change in government budget deficit. Using a second correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market, show the effect of the households’ response on the real interest rate.\n\nGiven your answer to part (b), explain what will happen to the country’s production possibilities curve in the long run.",
