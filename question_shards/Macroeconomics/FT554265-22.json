    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nGala Land produces three final goods: bread, water, and fruit. The table above shows this year’s output and price for each good.\n\nCalculate this year’s nominal gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nAssume that in Gala Land the GDP deflator (GDP price index) is 100 in the base year and 150 this year.\n\nCalculate each of the following.\n\nThe inflation rate, expressed as a percentage, between the base year and this year\n\nThis year’s real GDP\n\nSince the base year, workers have received a 20 percent increase in their nominal wages. If workers face the same inflation that you calculated in part (b)(i), what has happened to their real wages? Explain.\n\nIf the GDP deflator in Gala Land increases unexpectedly, would a borrower with a fixed-interest-rate loan be better off or worse off? Explain.",
