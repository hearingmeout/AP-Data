    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe outputs and prices of goods and services in Country X are shown in the table above. Assuming that 2009 is the base year, calculate each of the following.\n\nThe nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010\n\nThe real GDP in 2010\n\nIf in one year the price index is 50 and in the next year the price index is 55, what is the rate of inflation from one year to the next?\n\nAssume that next year’s wage rate will be 3 percent higher than this year’s because of inflationary expectations. The actual inflation rate is 4 percent. At the beginning of next year, will the real wage be higher, lower, or the same as today?\n\nAssume that Sara gets a fixed-rate loan from a bank when the expected inflation rate is 3 percent. If the actual inflation rate turns out to be 4 percent, who benefits from the unexpected inflation: Sara, the bank, neither, or both? Explain.\n\nThe text box below should be used for notes only and not your final response.",
