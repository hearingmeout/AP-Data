    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nPlate-tectonic theory states that the Earth’s lithosphere is broken into very slowly moving pieces or plates.Plate movements over vast stretches of time have led to the current orientation of our continents and oceans. Individual events along plate boundaries, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, pose periodic threats to human activity and ecosystems. The “Ring of Fire” is a term that describes the location of increased seismic and volcanic activity around the margins of the Pacific Ocean basin. On the map above, each dot represents a volcano or an earthquake.\n\nJapan, Indonesia, and the Philippines are examples of volcanic island chains that have formed along subduction zones between plates in the western Pacific.\n\nDescribe what happens when two tectonic plates collide along a subduction zone.\n\nExplain how subduction leads to volcanic activity.\n\nAlthough the landscape following a volcanic eruption may appear unable to support ecological communities, over time the area can be transformed through succession.\n\nWhat is primary succession?\n\nExplain how primary succession can lead to soil formation on a newly formed volcanic landscape.\n\nIn addition to volcanic activity, highly destructive tsunamis are generated along Pacific Plate subduction zones.\n\nExplain how a tsunami is generated along a subduction zone.\n\nDescribe one negative ecological impact that tsunamis have on coastal environments.\n\nSouthern California experiences periodic devastating earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault, which is a transform boundary located along the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate.\n\nDescribe what happens to the tectonic plates along a transform boundary at the moment when an earthquake occurs.\n\nDescribe what happens to the tectonic plates along a transform boundary during the time between earthquakes.",
