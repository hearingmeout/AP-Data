    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nOzone (O3) is an atmospheric trace gas that occurs naturally in the stratosphere. It is also formed as a consequence of human activity in the troposphere, immediately above Earth’s surface. The location of ozone in the atmosphere determines whether the gas protects or damages the environment.\n\nIdentify the type of solar radiation that is absorbed by stratospheric ozone, and describe one human health benefit that results from the absorption of this solar energy.\n\nThe absorption of solar energy by stratospheric ozone causes ozone molecules to undergo chemical decomposition and formation. Describe the chemical processes that lead to this natural balance between decomposition and formation of stratospheric ozone (you may use chemical equations in your answer).\n\nThe Montreal Protocol of 1987 provided a global framework to phase out chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production and use. Although the Montreal Protocol has led to a dramatic decrease in CFCs released into the atmosphere, stratospheric ozone destruction has decreased only slightly.\n\nExplain the process by which CFCs lead to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. (You may usechemical equations in your answer.)\n\nExplain why the rapid decrease in CFC emissions has not led to a similarly rapid decrease in the destruction of stratospheric ozone.\n\nIdentify a human activity that leads to the formation of tropospheric ozone as a secondary pollutant andexplain why tropospheric ozone levels peak in the daytime.\n\nIdentify one negative ecological impact and one negative human health impact that result from the formation of tropospheric ozone.",
