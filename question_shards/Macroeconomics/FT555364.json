Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nWetlands were once considered to be wastelands. Over 50 percent of the United States original wetlands have been destroyed.\n\nDescribe TWO characteristics that are used by scientists to define an area as a wetland.\n\nWetlands are highly productive ecosystems with complex food webs.\n\nComplete the diagram of the wetland food web below by drawing arrows that show the direction of energy flow.\n\nExplain why it takes many hectares of wetland to support a pair of eagles.\n\nDescribe TWO economic benefits (other than those related to water quality) that wetlands provide.\n\nDescribe one specific human activity that degrades wetlands.\n\nWastewater treatment plants perform some of the same water-quality improvement functions that natural wetlands perform. Explain how wetlands perform the equivalent of\n\nprimary treatment, and\n\nsecondary treatment",
