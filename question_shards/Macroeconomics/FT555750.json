Noting how successful the ban on the sake of phosphate detergents had been in improving conditions in Lake Fremont, Councilman Peter Budd proposed a ban on the use of all nitrogen-containing fertilizers in Fremont to solve the local photochemical-smog problem.\n\nCouncilwoman Nita Smith made a statement that \"although nitrogen-based fertilizers can cause other environmental problems, the ban on nitrogen fertilizers won't solve the smog problem in Fremont.\" After a heated discussion, the council tabled the motion on the ban.\n\nSupport Councilwoman Smith’s statement that nitrogen-based fertilizers cause other environmental problems by describing one such problem.\n\nIdentify a nitrogen-containing primary pollutant that contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.\n\nDescribe how that primary pollutant forms and explain why Councilman Budd was wrong.\n\nIdentify one secondary pollutant that is a component of photochemical smog and describe the following.\n\nHow the secondary pollutant forms\n\nONE human health effect of the pollutant\n\nONE environmental effect of the pollutant\n\nEarth’s natural nitrogen cycle occurs in several steps. Describe one chemical transformation that occurs in the natural nitrogen cycle and discuss the importance of that transformation to an ecosystem.",
