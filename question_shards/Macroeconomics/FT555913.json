    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.Some scientists estimate that by 2025 over 60 percent of the global human population will live in urban areas. Urban residents experience a variety of problems related to the physical environment.Describe how the temperature of urban areas like Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago differs from that of surrounding rural areas.Identify and describe TWO differences between urban and surrounding rural areas that contribute to the temperature difference between them.Urban areas typically have levels of air pollution that are significantly higher than those found in surrounding rural areas. Identify a characteristic of the urban microclimate that leads to higher levels of air pollution and describe how that characteristic contributes to the increase.Identify and describe TWO actions that local governments in urban areas could take to reduce outdoor air pollution.Identify and describe TWO ways in which the local hydrologic cycle of urban areas differs from that of nearby rural areas.",
