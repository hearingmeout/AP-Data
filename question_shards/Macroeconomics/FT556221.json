    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nRadioactive isotopes are widely used in the field of medicine, in the generation of electricity, and in the military. The use of radioactive isotopes has increased significantly over the past fifty years, leading to a corresponding increase in the amount of radioactive waste produced. The question of how to deal with radioactive waste is a topic of ongoing environmental concern.\n\nExplain how the properties of low-level radioactive waste differ from those of high-level radioactive waste and how these properties lead to different storage requirements. For one of the two types of radioactive waste, give an example of a specific isotope that may be present in the waste, and explain how human activity generates the waste.\n\nThe United States Department of Energy recently chose Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the site for the deep underground burial of high-level radioactive waste. Describe THREE characteristics of an ideal deep underground storage site for high-level radioactive waste.\n\nIdentify TWO other options that have been suggested for the long-term management of radioactive waste. Discuss the feasibility of each method.\n\nExposure to high levels of ionizing radiation has adverse effects on human health and can result in immediate death. Identify one sublethal adverse effect on human health that can result from exposure to ionizing radiation, and explain how this effect is caused by the radiation.",
