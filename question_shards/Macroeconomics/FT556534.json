    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\nA large, coal-fired electric power plant produces 12 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each day. Assume that an input of 10,000 BTU’s of heat is required to produce an output of 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity.\n\nShowing all steps in your calculations, determine the number of\n\nBTU’s of heat needed to generate the electricity produced by the power plant each day,\n\npounds of coal consumed by the power plant each day, assuming that one pound of coal yields 5,000 BTU’s of heat,\n\npounds of sulfur released by the power plant each day, assuming that the coal contains one percent sulfur by weight.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard for power plants such as this one is that no more than 1.2 pounds of sulfur be emitted per million BTU’s of heat generated. Using the results in part (a), determine whether the power plant meets the EPA standard.\n\nDescribe two ways by which a fuel-burning electric power plant can reduce its sulfur emissions.\n\nDiscuss why sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants are considered an environmental problem and describe one negative effect on an ecosystem that has been associated with sulfur emissions.",
