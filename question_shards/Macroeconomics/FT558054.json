    "question": "Haiti shares a border with the Dominican Republic on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. (a) The border between the two countries can be seen using satellite images because of the severe deforestation in Haiti. Provide one reason why deforestation commonly occurs in a less developed country such as Haiti. Describe one realistic strategy to reduce deforestation in a less developed country.(b) Deforestation can affect water quality. Identify one change that can occur in the water quality of streams within a watershed that has been deforested. Explain how deforestation can lead to this change. (c) Identify TWO environmental benefits, other than those related to water quality, of maintaining forest ecosystems. The table below contains demographic data for Haiti in 1995 and 2015.(d) Identify and discuss one factor in a less developed country that could contribute significantly to a change in life expectancy, similar to what occurred in Haiti from 1995 to 2015. (e) Identify and discuss one economic or cultural factor in a less developed country that could contribute significantly to a change in the fertility rate, similar to what occurred in Haiti from 1995 to 2015.",
