    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to \"Calculate,\" you must show how you arrived at your final answer. Singapore and Japan are trading partners. The Japanese economy is operating at full employment, and Japan’s current account balance is zero. Assume the exchange rate between the Singapore dollar (SGD) and the Japanese yen (JPY) changes from 1 SGD = 82 JPY to 1 SGD = 65 JPY. Does the JPY appreciate or depreciate against the SGD? Given your answer in part (a), will each of the following increase, decrease, or remain the same? The price of Japanese goods in Singapore dollars Japan’s net exports Draw a single correctly labeled graph with the long-run Phillips curve and short-run Phillips curve for Japan. On the graph, show the new short-run equilibrium as a result of the change in Japan’s net exports from part (b)(ii), labeled point X. Given your answer in part (b)(ii), will each of the following be in deficit, surplus, or zero for Japan? Current account balance Financial (capital) account balance",
