    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question.\n\nInclude correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to \"Calculate,\" you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nSingapore and Japan are trading partners. The Japanese economy is operating at full employment, and Japan’s current account balance is zero.\n\nAssume the exchange rate between the Singapore dollar (SGD) and the Japanese yen (JPY) changes from 1 SGD = 82 JPY to 1 SGD = 65 JPY. Does the JPY appreciate or depreciate against the SGD?\n\nGiven your answer in part (a), will each of the following increase, decrease, or remain the same?\n\nThe price of Japanese goods in Singapore dollars\n\nJapan’s net exports\n\nDraw a single correctly labeled graph with the long-run Phillips curve and short-run Phillips curve for Japan. On the graph, show the new short-run equilibrium as a result of the change in Japan’s net exports from part (b)(ii), labeled point X.\n\nGiven your answer in part (b)(ii), will each of the following be in deficit, surplus, or zero for Japan?\n\nCurrent account balance\n\nFinancial (capital) account balance",
