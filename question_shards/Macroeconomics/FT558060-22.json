    "description": "Assume that an economy is in long-run equilibrium. Assume that consumers wish to hold less money because they use credit cards more frequently to purchase goods and services than cash.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of the money market and show the effect of the reduced holdings of money on the equilibrium nominal interest rate in the short run.\n\nBased on the change in the interest rate in part (a), what will happen to each of the following in the short run?\n\nPrices of previously issued bonds\n\nThe price level and real income. Explain.\n\nWith a constant money supply, based on your answer to part b(ii), will the velocity of money increase, decrease, or remain the same, or is the change indeterminate?\n\nAssume the country’s banking system has limited reserves. If the central bank wishes to reverse the change in the interest rate identified in part (a), what open market operation would it use?",
