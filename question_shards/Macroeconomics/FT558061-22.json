    "description": "A country is at full employment and produces two types of goods: consumer goods and capital goods.\n\nDraw a correctly labeled graph of the production possibilities curve, with consumer goods on the horizontal axis and capital goods on the vertical axis. Indicate a point on your graph, labeled X, that represents full employment and a possible combination in which both goods are being produced.\n\nAssume there is an increase in the country’s national savings. Draw a correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market, showing the change in the real interest rate from the increase in savings.\n\nOn the same graph from part (a), show another point, labeled Z, that represents full employment and a new combination of consumer goods and capital goods consistent with the increase in the country’s national savings.\n\nReferring to your answer to part (c), will the long-run aggregate supply curve shift to the right, shift to the left, or remain the same? Explain.",
