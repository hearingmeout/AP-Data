    "question": "An Arctic food web includes the following organisms.\n\nNote: Figures not drawn to scale.\n\nRefer to the food web above to complete the following table.\n\nOther than showing which organisms are consumed by other organisms, describe what is indicated by the direction of the arrows in the diagram.\n\nAs the amount of sea ice has decreased, larger expanses of the Arctic Ocean are now completely free of sea ice for several weeks each summer. Ringed seals, the preferred prey of polar bears, come to holes in the sea ice to breathe.\n\nDescribe how the change in sea ice habitat is affecting polar bears’ ability to hunt and feed.\n\nExplain how melting sea ice leads to a feedback loop that increases Arctic warming.\n\nMany species, including some whales and birds, will travel thousands of kilometers during annual migrations.\n\nProvide one reason a species may migrate a long distance.\n\nThe North Atlantic right whale migrates between subtropical and polar waters annually. Nearly 50 percent of right whale deaths are due to human activities. Describe one commercial activity, other than whaling, that may result in the death of right whales.\n\nDescribe one strategy that could reasonably be implemented to decrease right whale deaths caused by the commercial activity you described in part (ii).",
