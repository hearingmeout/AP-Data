    "question": "In many parts of the world, biomass like peat, wood, and animal waste is burned indoors for cooking and home heating. Combustion of these fuels releases harmful household air pollutants that pose a health threat to billions of people, mostly in less developed countries.\n\nAir pollutants are released during the burning of biomass indoors for cooking and heating.\n\nIdentify TWO air pollutants released during the burning of biomass indoors for cooking and heating.\n\nIdentify a specific human respiratory illness that one of the pollutants you identified may cause.\n\nIdentify one realistic approach, other than banning the practice of burning biomass indoors, that could be used to reduce the impact of biomass combustion indoors on human respiratory health. Describe how this approach could reduce the incidence of respiratory illness. In 2016 approximately four million people died from illnesses attributed to household air pollutants from burning biomass indoors. More than 10 percent of these deaths occurred in children under the age of five in less developed countries.\n\nDiscuss one reason children under the age of five are at a greater risk than adults for illnesses linked to household air pollutants. In more developed countries, indoor air pollution is also a problem. Common indoor air pollutants in developed countries include:\n\n• asbestos\n\n• radon\n\n• mold\n\nChoose TWO of the three common indoor air pollutants (asbestos, radon, mold) listed above and complete the following table.\n\nIdentify a source for each indoor air pollutant.\n\nDescribe a method for reducing exposure to each of the two pollutants you chose.",
