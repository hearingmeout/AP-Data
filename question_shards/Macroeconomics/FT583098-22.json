    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question: Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer. Assume a country’s economy is currently in recession. (a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the long-run aggregate supply, short-run aggregate supply, and aggregate demand curves, and show each of the following. (i) Current real output, labeled <math alttext=\"y sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <msub> <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> </math>, and current price level, labeled <math alttext=\"PL sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>PL</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> (ii) Full employment output, labeled <math alttext=\"y sub f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</mi></msub></math> (b) Assuming the banking system has ample reserves, identify one action the central bank can take to help the economy recover from the recession. (c) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the reserve market, and show the impact of the central bank’s action identified in part (b) on the policy rate. (d) On your graph for part (a), show the effect of the central bank’s action identified in part (b) on real output and the price level. (e) Assume there is an increase in business confidence as a result of the central bank’s action. (i) What will happen to the demand for capital goods? (ii) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market, and show the effect of the change identified in part (e)(i) on the real interest rate. (f) Given your answer to part (e), what is the effect on potential real output in the long run? Explain.",
