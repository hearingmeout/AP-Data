    "question": "Scientists are interested in studying the bioaccumulation of mercury in different species of dolphins exposed to the same concentration of mercury. The dolphins in the study will be of similar age and living in the same habitat. Which of the following best identifies a testable hypothesis for the study?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Different species of dolphins will have different levels of mercury in their fatty tissues depending on the species’ ability to absorb and excrete mercury.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Dolphins will have the highest levels of mercury in their fatty tissues when they are exposed to the highest concentration of mercury.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Dolphin species that are not exposed to mercury in the water will still have trace levels of mercury in their muscle tissues from exposure through air.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The concentration of mercury in the tissues of different species of dolphins is dependent on the life span of the species and on the number of offspring produced.",
        "image": null
      }

    "answer": "Different species of dolphins will have different levels of mercury in their fatty tissues depending on the species’ ability to absorb and excrete mercury."
