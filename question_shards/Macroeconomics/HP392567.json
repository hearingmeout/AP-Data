Each person in the family of four showers once a day for an average of 10 minutes per shower. The shower has a flow rate of 5.0 gallons per minute. Calculate the following. Be sure to show all your work and include units with your answers. The total amount of water that the family uses per year for taking showers. The annual cost of the electricity for the family showers, assuming that 2.5 gallons per minute of the water used is from the hot-water heater The family is considering replacing their current hot-water heater with a new energy-efficient hot-water heater that costs $1,000 and uses half the energy that their current hot-water heater uses. How many days would it take for the new hot-water heater to recover the $1,000 initial cost? Describe TWO practical measures that the family could take that would reduce their overall water use at home. Describe TWO conservation measures (other than reducing hot water use) that the family could take to reduce the total amount of energy that they use at home.",
