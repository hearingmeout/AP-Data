    "question": "Directions: The suggested time is about 22 minutes for answering this question. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Studies indicate that between the present and 2050, substantial growth in population and energy consumption will occur both in less developed countries (LDCs) like India and China and in more developed countries (MDCs) like the United States and Japan. The table below displays these projections. Present 2050 Total Population: LDCs 5.1 x 109 7.8 x 109 Total Population: MDCs 1.2 x 109 1.3 x 109 Total Energy Consumption: LDCs 1.3 x 1017 Btu 5.2 x 1017 Btu Total Energy Consumption: MDCs 2.5 x 1017 Btu 3.0 x 1017 Btu Describe TWO current social conditions that support the prediction that most population growth will occur in LDCs between now and 2050. Calculate the percent increase in total energy consumption by LDCs between the present and 2050 total energy consumption by MDCs between the present and 2050 Describe TWO reasons why the percent change in total energy consumption by LDCs is projected to be so different from the percent change in total energy consumption by MDCs. Describe the process by which fossil fuels are used to provide electrical energy. The increase in the global energy demand is expected to outstrip the energy available from the burning of fossil fuels. Describe TWO sustainable methods of energy production that can make a significant contribution toward meeting the future global energy demand.",
