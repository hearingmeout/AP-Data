    "description": "Scientists studied the effects of three different ways to control household pests. They treated one group of pests with a conventional pesticide spray. A second group was treated using Integrated Pest Management ( <math alttext=\"I P M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>IPM</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> ) techniques. A third group received no treatment method at all. The success of each treatment was measured based on the change in the number of pests in the traps over time. Fewer pests caught indicate fewer pests in the area after application of the technique. The results are shown in the graph above.",
    "question": "Which of the following claims would be the best solution to the pest problem, based on the data in the graph?",
