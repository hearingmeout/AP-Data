    "description": "Scientists are interested in determining the average number of species that have migrated from the mainland to a group of islands, as shown below. Partway through their study, they decided to include an additional island in their study group.",
    "question": "Based on the theory of island biogeography, which of the following best explains how the scientists’ calculation of average number of species would change with the inclusion of this new island in their study?",
