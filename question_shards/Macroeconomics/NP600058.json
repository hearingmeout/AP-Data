    "question": "Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the trash collected from households and businesses. The graph below shows MSW generation in the United States from 1960 to 2012.(a) Use the data provided in the graph above to respond to the following.Explain one probable cause (other than increased composting) for the change in per capita waste generation from 2000 to 2012.Calculate the percent increase in total MSW generation from 1980 to 2012.(b) Two ways of managing MSW are incineration and disposal in landfills.Identify one disadvantage of waste incineration.Identify one disadvantage of waste disposal in landfills.Trash incineration is one way to generate electricity from MSW. Electricity can also be generated from waste buried in landfills.(c) Describe the specific steps of a process used to produce electricity from waste buried in a landfill.(d) Many landfills do not accept used tires. As a result, the tires are often dumped in poorly regulated piles.Describe one human health problem associated with piles of discarded tires.(e) Composting is one way to reduce the amount of waste that enters a landfill.Other than reducing the volume of waste, identify one advantage of composting.Identify one disadvantage of composting.",
