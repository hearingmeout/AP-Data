    "question": "Write your answers in the spaces provided. Refer to the figure or diagram to answer the question. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. The piping plover is a globally threatened species, with perhaps as few as 2,000 nesting pairs remaining in the Atlantic population of these migratory shorebirds. Plovers were nearly hunted to extinction in the nineteenth century. Plovers prefer to nest and search for food on open sandy beaches between sparsely vegetated sand dunes. Washovers, where sand is washed up from the beach and buries vegetated areas during big storms, are also important to plovers because they provide moist and undisturbed habitat for plover adults and their chicks. Ecologists with the Elliott Oceanographic Institute mapped the distribution of plover nests during two seasonal surveys of nesting sites over a ten-year period on Assateague Island. This is a barrier island, a long, narrow island running parallel to the Atlantic coast of Virginia. (a) Use the maps provided to answer the following questions. (i) Identify the preferred nesting habitat for piping plovers. (ii) Describe the change in the number of piping plover nests on Assateague Island between 1999 and 2009. (iii) Describe one likely reason for the change in the number of piping plover nests between 1999 and 2009.",

Describe one restriction that could reasonably be implemented to help prevent the destruction of plover nests by human actions.(ii) In addition to providing habitat for piping plovers, barrier islands (and closely related landforms) are important for other reasons. Explain one way that these features help to preserve and protect the environment in coastal regions.(iii) Identify one human action that directly threatens coastal habitats and describe one impact on species, other than the piping plover, that use the habitat.Approximately 40% of the United States population resides in coastal areas, such as areas near Assateague Island, where sea level rise and shoreline erosion is occurring.",
