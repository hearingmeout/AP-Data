    "question": "Directions: The following question(s) refer to the following article from the Fremont New Tribune.The Fremont New Tribune May 2, 2016. As another winter concludes, biologists are alarmed by the continued spread of white nose syndrome (W N S) in bats. W N S is a fungal disease that is decimating bat populations across eastern North American forests, with mortality rates reaching up to 100 percent at many sites. W N S has been found in at least 25 states in the United States and 5 Canadian provinces. The fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) grows well in cool conditions such as those found in caves and has been observed as white patches on the muzzles, noses, ears, and wings of many cave-dwelling bats. W N S has caused significant population declines for several bat species, including once-numerous species such as the little brown bat. (Myotis lucifugus). Little brown bats hunt using echolocation by emitting up to 200 high-frequency calls per second when pursuing their prey. When healthy, the little brown bat can live up to ten years and have one or two offspring (called pups) each year. “Little brown bats provide tremendous value to the United States economy every year by the essential services they provide to farmers and other people. We need to understand how this deadly disease spreads and attempt to help reduce its impact on the little brown bat and other bat species,” said Dr. Duke Serach of the Fremont office of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Dr. Serach concluded with “It may yet be possible to save the little brown bats, but the remaining population will be alarmingly small.”(a) Diseases can devastate populations; however, most diseases do not drive their host to extinction. Provide one explanation for why diseases seldom cause extinction.(b) Dr. Serach suggests that even if the impact of WNS on little brown bat populations can be reduced and the extinction of the species avoided, the bat populations are likely to remain alarmingly small.Describe TWO threats (other than WNS) to the survival of the bat species if the total number of bats becomes very small.If the little brown bat species does not become extinct and can potentially recover, the rate of recovery is likely to be slow. Discuss one aspect of bat biology that might slow the recovery of little brown bat populations to pre-WNS numbers.(c) Bats are found in ecosystems around the world. Describe TWO ways in which other organisms in an ecosystem could be affected by a decline in a bat population.(d) The Eastern deciduous forest in which the little brown bats live is an important ecosystem. Identify TWO ecosystem services that forests provide, and explain how each service benefits human society.WNS is an emerging disease in bats. Humans are also subject to emerging diseases, such as Ebola. A recent study suggests that the number of emerging infectious diseases affecting human populations has been steadily increasing in recent decades.(e) Provide a likely reason for the increase in emerging infectious diseases affecting human populations. Include an explanation for the reason you provided.",
