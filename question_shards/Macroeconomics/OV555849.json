    "question": "Write your answers in the spaces provided. Refer to the figure or diagram to answer the question. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Temperate grasslands are found in many regions across the globe, including throughout the Midwestern United States. In these areas, the terrain is very flat and the primary vegetation consists of grasses and small shrubs. Below is a climatograph of a temperate grassland in Wichita, Kansas. Temperature is shown in the line graph and precipitation is shown in the bar graph. (a) Use the climatograph above to identify the following. (i) Identify the month with the least amount of rainfall in this temperate grassland. (ii) Identify the maximum mean monthly temperature in this temperate grassland. (iii) A climatograph for a tropical grassland or savanna would look different from the climatograph shown for a temperate grassland. Describe one difference in the patterns or trends in the temperature data in a tropical grassland compared to those of a temperate grassland.",
