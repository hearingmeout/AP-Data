      {
        "label": "The exhaust from off-road vehicles releases more carbon dioxide into the local ecosystem, promoting a higher level of photosynthesis in plants resulting in less of a threat to plants than to animals.",

      {
        "label": "Animals are mobile and able to avoid trampling, but because plants are stationary, transient-human activity affects a larger percent of plants than of animals.",

      {
        "label": "Displaced animals are now in direct competition with more species that share a similar niche, so transient-human activity affects a larger percent of animals than of plants.",
