(i) Identify an ecosystem service provided by rivers. (ii) Assuming the dyes are dark in color, describe how photosynthetic algae living in the water would be affected by the release of dyes into rivers. (iii) Textile dyes often contain heavy metals such as lead, chromium, and cadmium. Describe how heavy metals in nearby rivers could affect predators at the top of the food chain.",
