    "question": "Researchers have found that over the last twenty years there are fewer native plants in the alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains east of Salt Lake City and that the abundance of two species of invasive grasses has increased. Which of the following questions is most appropriate to ask when investigating the cause of the change in the alpine meadows?",

      {
        "label": "Has an increase in soil nitrates from air pollution allowed the invasive grasses to outcompete the native plants?",

        "label": "Has the increased level of tropospheric ozone raised the soil pH of the meadows to a level that the native plants cannot tolerate?",
