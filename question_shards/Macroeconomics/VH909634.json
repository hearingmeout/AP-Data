    "question": "Five different species of warblers, seed-eating birds, live in the same species of conifer trees. All of the birds migrate to coniferous forests during the summer, and different species reside in different areas in the same tree. They feed on the seeds of the conifer trees, but the different species do not mate with each other.\nWhich of the following best explains why the different warbler species can all have habitats in the same conifer trees?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Not all the warblers are residents in the forest at the same time of the year because of different migration patterns.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Physiological differences in beak structure allow the warblers to consume different species of seeds through symbiotic relationships.",

      {
        "label": "Resource partitioning of the seeds reduces competition, and the five different species can live in the same tree.",

        "label": "Niche overlap occurs between the five different species, and living in the same tree increases competition for seeds.",
