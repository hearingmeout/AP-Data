    "description": "Cholera is an acute infection of the digestive system that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Infected individuals can experience a range of symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and extreme thirst. If symptoms persist and severe dehydration results, an infected individual can die within hours of symptom onset. The diagram below shows how cholera is transmitted.",
    "question": "Based on the diagram above, which of the following is the most likely reason that V. cholerae can spread rapidly through a population?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "V. cholerae is a microscopic bacterium that can survive in various aquatic environments for prolonged periods of time and can cause a delayed onset of visible symptoms.",

        "label": "V. cholerae eventually becomes airborne and is spread through the inhalation of spores, causing a delayed onset of visible symptoms.",

        "label": "V. cholerae is transmitted via an insect vector and often goes undiagnosed in isolated communities.",
