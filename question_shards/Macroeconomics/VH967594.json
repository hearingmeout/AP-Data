    "description": "Long Island Sound is a body of water off the northeast coast of the United States. Over nine million people live in the small watershed area that feeds into the sound. To determine the effect of the population density on the watershed, scientists measured the oxygen content of bottom waters in the sound. The data from late summer 2013 are displayed in the map below.",
