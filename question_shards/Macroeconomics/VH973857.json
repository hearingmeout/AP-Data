    "description": "A scientist wanted to investigate the effect of tropospheric ozone on the respiratory function of mice. Twenty female mice were placed in one of five different field environments that mimicked the natural habitats of the mice. Each environment had a tube connected to it that would pump in a set level of ozone measured in <math alttext=\"parts per million\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. In each field environment, the scientist measured the average respiratory output for the twenty mice over a three-month time frame.",
