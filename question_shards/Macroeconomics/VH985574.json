The change in sea level can be affected by land movement. Land movement itself can be caused by subsiding coastal lands, oil and water extraction, and plate tectonics. The diagram shows the relative sea level rise at various coastal locations in the United States from 1960 to 2014.",
    "question": "Based on the information in the map, which areas in the United States have experienced the greatest sea level rise?",
