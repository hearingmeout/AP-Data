    "description": "Cane toads are an invasive species that were introduced to Australian ecosystems. Researchers studying cane toads hypothesize that cane toads are negatively affecting native species. The researchers observed different locations with and without cane toads and collected the data that are presented in the following graph.",
    "question": "Which of the following best interprets the results in the graph in relation to the given hypothesis?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The results support the researchers’ hypothesis because there is a greater biodiversity at sites with cane toads.",
