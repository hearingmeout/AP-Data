    "description": "The spotted lanternfly is a herbivorous insect that is native to Asia and feeds on over <math alttext=\"70\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>70</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> species of plants. The feeding behavior of the spotted lanternfly damages plants, and the nymph and adult lanternflies secrete sticky residues that exacerbate the damage to native plant species by promoting mold growth. The spotted lanternfly reproduces once during its lifetime by laying between <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"50\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>50</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> eggs, and the eggs hatch after a short amount of time. The range of the spotted lanternfly is increasing because the insects are transported to new environments by the movements of animals and people, and it is now found in many parts of the United States.",
