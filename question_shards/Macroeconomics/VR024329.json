  "content": {
    "description": "Bats use echolocation to find prey by emitting high-pitched bursts of sound and analyzing the reflection. Scientists studying a population of bats in a forest observed that their population size had declined in the years following the completion of a nearby highway.",
    "question": "Based on the information, which of the following best explains how noise pollution from the highway has affected the size of the bat population?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The highway noise is decreasing the bats’ echolocation, allowing them to catch more prey each night.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The highway noise is interfering with bats’ echolocation, preventing them from successfully locating and catching prey as they fly.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The highway noise is producing sound waves that disrupt air flow, preventing the bats from flying at night.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The highway noise is attracting more bats to the forest, causing an increase in intraspecies competition.",
