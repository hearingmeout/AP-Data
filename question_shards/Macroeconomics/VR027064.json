    "description": "The snowshoe hare (a member of the rabbit family) is the primary prey for the Canadian lynx. The Canadian lynx is a wild feline that is slightly larger than a bobcat. Scientists plan to investigate the relative sizes of the hare and the lynx populations over a 3-year period.",
    "question": "Based on predator-prey dynamics, which of the following identifies the hypothesis most likely to be supported by the study?",
