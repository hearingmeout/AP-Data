    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nA national newspaper’s headline reads “Business Confidence Reaches Highest Level in 5 Years.”\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the loanable funds market, and show the effect of high business confidence on the equilibrium real interest rate.\n\n(b) Assume the government increases its spending on capital projects and infrastructure. Would financing the increased government spending by borrowing result in a higher, a lower, or the same equilibrium real interest rate? Explain.\n\n(c) Based solely on the change in the real interest rate identified in part (b), what will happen to the amount of private savings?\n\n(d) If the expected inflation rate decreases to zero, will the nominal interest rate be greater than, less than, or equal to the real interest rate?
