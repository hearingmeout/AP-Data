A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nAssume that a country’s economy is currently in recession.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the long-run and short-run Phillips curves. Label the current equilibrium as point <math alttext=\"Z\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Z</mtext></math>.\n\n(b) Assume the banking system has limited reserves, banks in the country hold no excess reserves, and the public’s holding of currency is constant. The required reserve ratio is <math alttext=\"25percent\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mtext>25%</mtext> </math>. The central bank of the country buys <math alttext=\"dollars100\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mtext>$100</mtext> </math> billion in bonds from the nonbank public.\n\n(i) By how much will the monetary base of the country change?\n\n(ii) Calculate the change in the amount of loans in the banking system in the country. Show your work.\n\n(iii) Calculate the change in the money supply in the country. Show your work.\n\n(c) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the money market and show the effect of the change in the money supply identified in part (b)(iii) on the nominal interest rate.\n\n(d) Assume there is no change in inflationary expectations. On your graph in part (a), label a point W that is consistent with the effect of the change in the nominal interest rate identified in part (c).\n\n(e) Based on the change in the interest rate identified in part (c), how will the international value of the country’s currency change?\n\n(f) Based on your answer in part (e), will the country’s net exports increase, decrease, or stay the same?
