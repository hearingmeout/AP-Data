    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to \"Calculate,\" you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nAssume the economy of Artland is currently operating above full employment.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the short-run aggregate supply, long-run aggregate supply, and aggregate demand curves, and show each of the following.\n\n(i) The current equilibrium real output and price level, labeled as <math alttext=\"Y sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Y</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"P L sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>PL</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, respectively\n\n(ii) The full-employment output, labeled as <math alttext=\"Y sub f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Y</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>f</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\n(b) Assume the central bank and the government do not take any policy actions to close the output gap.\n\n(i) On your graph in part (a), show how the economy automatically adjusts in the long run and label the new equilibrium price level <math alttext=\"P L sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>PL</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>.\n\n(ii) Explain the cause of the adjustment shown in part (b)(i).\n\n(c) Alternatively, suppose the government wants to close the output gap using fiscal policy.\n\n(i) Identify a fiscal policy action the government could implement to close the output gap.\n\n(ii) How will the fiscal policy action identified in part (c)(i) affect the following?\n\n- The unemployment rate\n\n- The natural rate of unemployment\n\n(iii) In closing the output gap, will the automatic adjustment identified in part (b)(i) produce a higher, a lower, or the same price level compared to the fiscal policy identified in part (c)(i) ?\n\n(d) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the market for loanable funds. Show the effect of the fiscal policy action identified in part (c)(i) on the equilibrium real interest rate.\n\n(e) Given the interest rate change identified in part (d), will the long-run aggregate supply curve shift to the right, shift to the left, or remain the same in the long run?
