    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to \"Calculate,\" you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nAssume the expected inflation rate in a country is 3%, the current unemployment rate is 6%, and the natural rate of unemployment is 4%.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the short-run and long-run Phillips curves. Label the current short-run equilibrium as point X and plot the numerical values above on the graph.\n\n(b) Is the actual inflation rate greater than, less than, or equal to the expected inflation rate of 3%?\n\n(c) Assume loans were made taking into account the expected inflation rate of 3%. Will lenders be better off or worse off after they realize the actual inflation rate identified in part (b) ? Explain.\n\n(d) Based on the relationship between the actual and the expected inflation rates identified in part (a), what will happen to the natural rate of unemployment in the long run?",
