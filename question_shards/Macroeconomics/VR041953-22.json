Explain.\n\n(c) Consider the foreign exchange market for Econland’s currency.\n\n(i) Based on your answer to part (b), what will happen to the international value of Econland’s currency?\n\n(ii) Based on your answer to part c (i), would Econland’s central bank buy or sell its currency in the foreign exchange market to offset the change in the value of its currency?",
