    "question": "The ability to smell is critical for salmon. They depend on scent to avoid predators, sniff out prey, and find their way home at the end of their lives …. Research from the University of Washington and <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>NOAA</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science Center shows this … sense of smell might be in trouble as carbon emissions continue to be absorbed by our ocean. … The research team set up tanks of salt water with three different <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>pH</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> levels: today's current average Puget Sound <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>pH</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>, the predicted average <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>50</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> years from now, and the predicted average <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>100</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> years in the future. They exposed juvenile coho salmon to these three different <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>pH</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> levels for two weeks. After two weeks, the team ran a series of … tests to see whether the fishes' sense of smell was affected. Fish were placed in a holding tank and exposed to the smell of salmon-skin extract, which indicates a predator attack and usually prompts the fish to hide or swim away. Fish that were in water with current <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> levels responded normally to the offending odor, but the fish from tanks with higher <math> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> levels didn't seem to mind or detect the smell. … While this study looked specifically at how an altered sense of smell could affect fishes' response to danger, it's likely that other critical behaviors that depend on smell, such as navigation, reproduction, and hunting for food, would also take a hit if fish aren't able to adequately process smells. … University of Washington Which of the following best identifies the author’s claim?",
