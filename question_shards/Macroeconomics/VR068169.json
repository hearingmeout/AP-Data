    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nAssume that the country of Zeetoland is in short-run equilibrium. The expected inflation rate is <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>4</mtext></math> percent, the actual rate of unemployment is <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>5</mtext></math> percent, the natural rate of unemployment is <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>6</mtext></math> percent, and the equilibrium real interest rate is <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>3</mtext></math> percent.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the aggregate demand, short-run aggregate supply, and long-run aggregate supply curves for Zeetoland, and show each of the following.\n\n(i) The current equilibrium real output and price level, labeled <math alttext=\"Y sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Y</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"PL sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mtext>PL</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub></math> respectively\n\n(ii) The full-employment output, labeled <math alttext=\"Y sub F \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Y</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\n(b) Assume no policy action is taken to address the output gap in Zeetoland. Explain how the economy will adjust to full employment in the long run.\n\n(c) Assume instead that the central bank is concerned about the buildup of inflationary pressures in Zeetoland and is considering taking action to fight inflation. Assuming the banking system in Zeetoland has ample reserves, identify one monetary policy action the central bank would likely take.\n\n(d) How would the monetary policy action identified in part (c) affect each of the following in the short run?\n\n(i) The price of previously issued bonds in Zeetoland\n\n(ii) Real output in Zeetoland. Explain.\n\n(iii) Net financial capital flows to Zeetoland. Explain.\n\n(e) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the foreign exchange market for Zeetoland’s currency, the zeet, and show the effect of the monetary policy action identified in part (c) on the demand and the exchange rate for the zeet.\n\n(f) Based on the change in the value of the zeet shown in part (e), what will happen to Zeetoland’s exports?
