    "description": "Concerns About Endangered Birds Won’t Stop July 4 Fireworks Show in Old Orchard Beach\nThe Fourth of July fireworks show will go on as planned in Old Orchard Beach on Thursday despite concerns about an endangered bird that was about to give birth to a brood of chicks nearby.\nThe piping plover’s nest was only <math alttext=\"400\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>400</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> feet from where the fireworks are staged, . . . sparking concerns that the explosions and the thousands of people expected to attend the traditional waterfront display could disrupt the birds and their nest.\n. . . Town Manager Larry Mead said the holiday fireworks display will go on as planned Thursday because the chicks have hatched and the birds are expected to move away from the noise and crowds. . . .\nThere are currently a record <math alttext=\"87\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>87</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> nesting plover pairs in Maine, according to Laura Zitske, director of Maine Audubon’s Piping Plover and Least Term Project. . . . Piping plovers require wide, open sand and dune grass to nest. The birds are endangered largely because of habitat loss.\nUncertainty about the Independence Day display surfaced in Old Orchard last week when the town canceled its Thursday night fireworks display, a summer tradition in this beachfront resort that draws thousands of visitors each week.\n<math alttext=\"O O B 3 6 5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>OOB365</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, a group of Old Orchard Beach businesses and private citizens, hinted at a brewing conflict with the nesting plover site on its Facebook page.\n“Tonight’s fireworks (June <math alttext=\"27\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>27</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>) have been cancelled due to the nesting piping plovers along the beach. Fingers crossed for next week and the <math alttext=\"fourth\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>4</mn><mtext>th</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> of July,” <math alttext=\"O O B 3 6 5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>OOB365</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> said in the post.\nMead met with officials from Maine Audubon . . . Friday and they agreed to set up a protective corridor around the plover nesting site on the night of July Fourth. Signs, twine, and netting will make it clear that the area will be off-limits to the public, Mead said. . . .\nIndependence Day fireworks are one of the annual sources of concern for the plovers. Zitske said fireworks can scare parents away from newly hatched chicks that need to be kept warm, and Audubon employees have come across nests in the past only to find dead chicks.\nTypically, the biggest concern about piping plovers and the Fourth of July is the crowds of people walking on the beach in the dark after the fireworks are over, Zitske said. In some areas, volunteers will stand guard to keep people from trampling over nesting areas in the dark. . . .\nZitske . . . attributes the nesting success in large part to increased educational outreach to beachgoers, who must share the beaches with the bird.Reprinted with permission from the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram.
