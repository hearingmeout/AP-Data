    "description": "In 1960, an invasive fly was introduced to the Galapagos islands.\n\nTo understand the relationship between the invasive fly and the tree finches that live on the island, researchers examined the mating success of two species of finches. Some finches had nests with flies and some did not. The data from the study are in the table.\n\nPERCENTAGE OF SUCCESSFUL MATINGS OF GALÁPAGOS FINCHES\n\nInvasive fly Present inthe Nest\n Invasive fly Not Presentin the Nest\n\nSmall finch\n <math alttext=\"43%\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>43</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>\n <math alttext=\"93%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>93</mn><mo>%</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\nMedium finch\n <math alttext=\"35%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>35</mn><mo>%</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>\n <math alttext=\"80%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>80</mn><mo>%</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>",
