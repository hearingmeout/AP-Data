    "description": "The graph below shows the experimental data from an investigation testing how carbon monoxide levels in the ambient air alter the amount of oxygen hemoglobin can carry. The experiment was performed with five different laboratory mice. Each mouse was kept in its own habitat under constant conditions of water, food, light, and temperature. Each mouse was exposed to a different concentration of carbon monoxide, and the oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin was measured.",
    "question": "Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from the investigation?",
