    "description": "A student reads that nanosilver particles are used in cosmetics to allow nutrients to penetrate deeper into the skin. When the cosmetics are washed off, the nanosilver particles can enter freshwater ecosystems. These particles may decrease survival in many aquatic organisms. The student determines that Daphnia magna, a tiny freshwater crustacean widely found in North America, might make a good test subject for an experiment.",
