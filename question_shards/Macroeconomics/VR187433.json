    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nRespond to all parts of the question.\n\nThe United States is currently in a recession with an output gap of <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"> <mtext>$500</mtext> </mstyle> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> billion.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the aggregate demand, short-run aggregate supply, and long-run aggregate supply curves, and show each of the following.\n\n(i) The current equilibrium real output and price level, labeled as <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>Y</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> and <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>PL</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>, respectively\n\n(ii) The full-employment output, labeled as <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>Y</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>f</mtext> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>\n\n(b) If the marginal propensity to consume in the United States is <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"> <mrow> <mtext>0.8</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>, calculate the minimum amount of government spending required to increase aggregate demand by the amount of the recessionary output gap of <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"> <mtext>$500</mtext> </mstyle> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> billion. Show your work.\n\n(c) Suppose instead the government decides to reduce personal income taxes with no change in government spending. In order to increase aggregate demand by the amount of the recessionary output gap of <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"> <mtext>$500</mtext> </mstyle> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> billion, would the tax cut need to be greater than, less than, or equal to the change in government spending identified in part (b)? Explain.\n\n(d) On your graph in part (a), show the impact of the tax cut on the short-run equilibrium price level, labeling the new price level as <math overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>PL</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>.\n\n(e) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the money market. Show the impact of an increase in nominal gross domestic product on the equilibrium nominal interest rate.\n\n(f) Based on your answer to part (e), what will happen to real interest rates in the United States assuming there is no change in inflationary expectations?\n\n(g) Based solely on the real interest rate change in part (f), what will happen to each of the following?\n\n(i) The demand for the dollar in the foreign exchange market. Explain.\n\n(ii) The stock of physical capital. Explain.",
