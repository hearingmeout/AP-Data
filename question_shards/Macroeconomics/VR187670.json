The horizontal axis is labeled “Machines,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Grain.” There is an inner curve and an outer curve. The inner curve begins on and about one third of the way up the vertical axis, and gradually moves downward and to right for a short period of time. It then turns to steeply move downward and to the right and ends on and about one third of the way along the horizontal axis. The outer curve begins on and about two thirds of the way up the vertical axis, and gradually moves downward and to the right until it reaches about one third of the way along the horizontal axis. At this point, the outer curve turns to steeply move downward and to the right and ends on and about two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis. There is an arrow located slightly to the right of the vertical axis, between the two curves, that points upward and to the right from the inner curve to the outer curve.",
