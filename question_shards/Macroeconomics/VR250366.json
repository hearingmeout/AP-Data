    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe following macroeconomic data are from a fictitious country’s economy in 2015. Dollar values are measured in billions of 2015 dollars, and population figures are measured in millions. Assume the country’s economy is in short-run equilibrium.\n\nConsumption\n $250\n\nPopulation\n 240\n\nInvestment\n $60\n\nLabor Force\n 200\n\nExports\n $25\n\nEmployed\n 182\n\nImports\n $20\n\nGovernment Spending\n $45\n\nExpected Inflation Rate\n 4%\n\nTaxes\n $15\n\nPotential Real Output\n $350\n\n(a) Calculate the actual rate of unemployment. Show your work.\n\n(b) Is the economy facing a recessionary gap, an inflationary gap, or neither? Explain using numbers.\n\n(c) Based on your answer to part (b), how will the economy adjust in the long run in the absence of any government policy action? Explain.\n\n(d) Now assume the economy is in long-run equilibrium.(i) Assume autonomous consumption spending decreases by $10 billion and the marginal propensity to save is 0.8. Calculate the maximum possible change in real output. Show your work.(ii) Based on the change in autonomous consumption spending, what will happen to the equilibrium price level in the short run? Explain.\n\n(e) Based on the change in real output identified in part (d)(i), is the actual rate of unemployment greater than, less than, or equal to the natural rate of unemployment in the short run? Explain.\n\n(f) Based on loanable funds market analysis, how will a decrease in tax revenue affect the equilibrium real interest rate? Explain.\n\n(g) Based solely on the change in the equilibrium real interest rate identified in part (f), what will be the effect on each of the following?(i) The price of previously issued bonds. Explain.(ii) Potential real output. Explain.",
