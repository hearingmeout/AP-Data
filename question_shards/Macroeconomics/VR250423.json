    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nGabra’s economy is in short-run equilibrium with a recessionary gap of $60 billion, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.75. The expected inflation rate is 9%, and the natural rate of unemployment is 12%.\n\n(a) Based on the Phillips curve model, is the actual inflation rate greater than, less than, or equal to the expected inflation rate of 9% in Gabra? Explain.\n\n(b) Assume the government takes no policy action with regard to the state of Gabra’s economy.(i) What will happen to inflationary expectations in the long run? Explain.(ii) How will the long-run adjustment process be represented in the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model? Explain.\n\n(c) Assume that instead of waiting for the long-run adjustment, the government of Gabra is considering using fiscal policy to address the recessionary gap of $60 billion.(i) If the government chooses to increase its deficit spending, calculate the minimum change in government spending required to increase aggregate demand by the amount of the recessionary gap. Show your work.(ii) How will the effect of the government’s action in part (c)(i) be represented in the Phillips curve model? Explain.(iii) If the government chooses to decrease income taxes instead of increasing its spending, calculate the minimum change in income taxes required to increase aggregate demand by the amount of the recessionary gap. Show your work.(iv) Now suppose instead that the government wants to maintain a balanced budget and decreases both government spending and income taxes by $50 billion. Will this policy make the output gap smaller, make the output gap larger, or have no effect on the output gap? Explain.\n\n(d) Suppose the government chose to implement only the policy described in part (c)(i). Based on loanable funds market analysis, what will happen to each of the following?(i) Real interest rates in Gabra. Explain.(ii) Private savings. Explain.",
