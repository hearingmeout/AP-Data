    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nJapan and Malaysia are trading partners. Both countries have the same amount of resources and can produce cars and/or electronics. The production possibilities curves below show the combination of cars and electronics that each country can produce.\n\n(a) Assume that prior to trade, Malaysia is producing <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> units of cars and <math alttext=\"40\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> units of electronics. What can you conclude about the use of resources in Malaysia? Explain using the production possibilities curve model.\n\n(b) Which country has the comparative advantage in the production of electronics? Explain using numbers.\n\n(c) Now assume each country specializes in the production of the good in which it has a comparative advantage, and the terms of trade are <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>6</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> units of electronics for <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> unit of cars. Are these terms of trade mutually beneficial? Explain.\n\n(d) Assume Malaysia and Japan are able to double the production of cars. Which country now has the absolute advantage in the production of cars? Explain using numbers.\n\n(e) Assume Japan’s civilian working-age population is <math alttext=\"350\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>350</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> million, the labor force participation rate in Japan is <math alttext=\"80%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>80</mn><mo>%</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>, and the unemployment rate is <math alttext=\"10%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo>%</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>. Calculate the number of unemployed people in Japan. Show your work.",
