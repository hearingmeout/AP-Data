The students hypothesized that there would be more insect biodiversity in the leaf litter at the nature preserve than at the managed site. The leaf litter from each site was placed into a funnel with a light shone on the top to drive any insects out of the litter. Species were collected in an alcohol-filled container below the funnel, and the species were identified using magnifying lenses and a key.\n(h) Identify the independent variable in the experiment.",
