Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. The diagram shows the watershed around an underground mine. Stream 3 runs from the top of the mountain ridge to the lake. The entire watershed is underlain by bedrock that contains some metal. A town on the lake shore is concerned because of an increase in metal contaminants in the lake. (a) Based on the diagram, describe how human activities could have increased the amount of metal contaminants in stream 3.",
