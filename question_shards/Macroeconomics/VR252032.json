Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Scientists conducted a study in 2009 to determine the percentage of acres of corn in the United States that were infested with the western corn rootworm, an insect that severely reduces corn yields. The map below shows the data they collected on the infestation of this common agricultural pest. (a) Based on the distribution of biomes in the United States, describe the ecological niche that is occupied by the dominant native plant community that inhabits region C.",
