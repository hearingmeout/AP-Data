The students were exploring how earthworms act as an important species in the cycling of nutrients. The students built three different terrariums like the one shown below and altered the number of earthworms in each terrarium in the following manner.\n\nTerrarium <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> had zero earthworms added.\n\nTerrarium <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> had five earthworms added.\n\nTerrarium <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> had ten earthworms added.\n\nOne snail was added to each terrarium, and each system contained the same number of grass seedlings, the same type of loam soil, and the same amount of water.
