    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nIn the country of Zuma, the natural rate of unemployment is <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>5</mtext></math> percent, the actual rate of unemployment is <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>10</mtext></math> percent, and the nominal interest rate is <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>3</mtext></math> percent.\n\n(a) Zuma produces two goods: food and capital goods. Draw a correctly labeled production possibilities curve for Zuma with food on the horizontal axis and capital goods on the vertical axis. Indicate a point on your graph, labeled <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>W</mtext></math>, which represents the current state of the economy.\n\n(b) Should the government increase, decrease, or keep income taxes unchanged to move the economy toward potential output? Explain.\n\n(c) On your graph in part (a), show another point, labeled <math alttext=\"Y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Y</mtext></math>, which shows the effect of the change in income taxes identified in part (b).\n\n(d) Suppose now there is an improved method of producing food only.\n\n(i) Show the effect of this new method of production on your graph in part (a), labeling the new production possibilities curve as <math alttext=\"P P C subscript 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mtext>PPC</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></math>.\n\n(ii) Based on your answer to part (d) (i), what happens to the opportunity cost of producing capital goods?",
