    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answer. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nAssume the required reserve ratio in the country of Rayogi is 5 percent, and the banking system in Rayogi has limited reserves.\n\n(a) If Rayogi’s central bank sells <math alttext=\"$10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>$10</mtext></math> million of securities to commercial banks and the commercial banks pay for the securities out of their reserves, calculate the maximum possible change in the money supply. Show your work.\n\n(b) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the money market, and show the effect of the change in the money supply identified in part (a) on the equilibrium nominal interest rate in Rayogi.\n\n(c) Assume no change in inflationary expectations. Based on the change in the nominal interest rate identified in part (b), what will happen to the real interest rate in Rayogi?\n\n(d) Based on your answer to part (c), what will happen to the economic growth rate in Rayogi?
