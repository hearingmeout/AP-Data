    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nAssume that the banking system has limited reserves and commercial banks must hold a minimum of <math alttext=\"20%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>20%</mtext></math> of their deposits as reserves. Now suppose that the central bank of the country sells <math alttext=\"$100,000\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>$100,000</mtext></math> of government bonds to commercial banks.\n\n(a) Calculate the maximum change and state the direction of change in the money supply as a result of the central bank bond sale. Show your work.\n\n(b) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the money market and show the effect of the change in the money supply identified in part (a) on the nominal interest rate.\n\n(c) Given the change in the money supply in part (a), if the velocity of money is constant, what will happen to the nominal gross domestic product? Explain.\n\n(d) Based on the change in the nominal gross domestic product in part (c), what happens to the price level if the real gross domestic product is constant?",
