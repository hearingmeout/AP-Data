    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nItaly and Japan are trading partners and have flexible exchange rates. The Italian currency is the euro and the Japanese currency is the yen.\n\n(a) Suppose that the exchange rate between the euro and the yen is <math alttext=\"1 euro equals 100 yen\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>1 euro = 100 yen</mtext></math>. What is the price of an Italian coat in yen if the coat costs <math alttext=\"120 euros\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>120 euros</mtext></math> in Italy?\n\n(b) Assume that real interest rates increase in Japan. Identify what will happen to net financial capital flows between Italy and Japan.\n\n(c) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the foreign exchange market for the yen and show the effect of the increase in real interest rates in Japan on the value of the yen.\n\n(d) Based solely on the change in the exchange rate identified in part (c), what will happen to Italy’s exports to Japan?
