    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe economy of Noralandia is in short-run equilibrium with an actual inflation rate that is currently higher than the expected inflation rate.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the short-run and long-run Phillips curves. Label the current short-run equilibrium point as X.\n\n(b) The banking system in Noralandia has ample reserves. Identify a specific monetary policy action that the central bank of Noralandia would take to bring the inflation rate closer to the expected inflation rate.\n\n(c) Noralandia has an open economy and a flexible exchange rate. Based solely on the effect of the monetary policy action identified in part (b) on interest rates in Noralandia, will there be an increase, a decrease, or no change in the flow of international financial capital into Noralandia? Explain.\n\n(d) Based on your answer to part (c), what will happen to the international value of Noralandia’s currency? Explain.",
