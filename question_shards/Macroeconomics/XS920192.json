    "description": "Researchers in the Galápagos Islands measured the average beak size in a population of finches from 1976 to 1984, as shown in the graph below. Birds with smaller beaks are better suited for grasses and soft seeds, while birds with larger beaks are better suited for seeds and nuts. In years with less rainfall, there are fewer grasses to feed on and the finches rely more on seeds for food. In 1977, 1980, and 1982, there were droughts, and the area experienced significantly less rainfall than average.",
    "question": "Which statement is best supported by the data in the graph?",
