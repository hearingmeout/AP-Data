    "question": "Read the following article from the Fremont Daily Times and answer the questions that follow.(a) Describe TWO effects that ingesting microbeads has on aquatic organisms.(b) Dr. Ewoldsen states that nitrates pose different threats to aquatic ecosystems than microbeads do. Describe how nitrate levels can negatively affect water quality in some aquatic ecosystems. (c) While wastewater treatment plants are ineffective at removing microbeads, they are very effective at removing large pieces of plastic waste and other pollutants. Identify one way large pieces of plastic are removed from wastewater during primary treatment. Prior to discharge, wastewater is often disinfected. Identify one technique commonly used to disinfect wastewater.Sludge or biosolids produced during the wastewater treatment process can be spread on agricultural fields. Identify one advantage and one disadvantage of this practice.(d) Coastal ecosystems are threatened by other human activities in addition to wastewater disposal. Mangrove swamps are one such threatened ecosystem. Provide one reason why mangrove trees are being removed by humans. Identify one ecosystem service provided by intact mangrove ecosystems.",
