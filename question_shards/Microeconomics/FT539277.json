    "question": "Karen works part-time at a local convenience store and earns $10 per hour. She wants to spend next Saturday afternoon attending a music concert. The full price of a concert ticket is $75, but Karen was able to get a discounted price of $50 from a friend who purchased the ticket but has become unable to attend. If Karen took 4 hours off from her job to attend the concert, what was her opportunity cost of attending the concert?",
