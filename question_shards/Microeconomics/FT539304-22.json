    "description": "Utility maximization is a fundamental assumption in consumer theory.\n\nExplain what is meant by diminishing marginal utility.\n\nAssume that a consumer buys only two goods:X and Y. What is the utility-maximizing decision rule for the consumer in allocating total income to good X and good Y?\n\nAssume that a utility- maximizing consumer is spending all of her income on the two goods, X and Y. The price per unit of good X is $2, and the price per unit of good Y is $3. The marginal utility of the last unit of good Y consumed is 15. What is the marginal utility of the last unit of good X consumed?\n\nAssume that good X is a normal good and good Y is an inferior good. Assume that the consumer's income does not change. Assume that the price of good X increases.\n\nIndicate how the substitution effect of the increase in the price of good X will affect purchases of\n\ngood X\n\ngood Y\n\nIndicate how the income effect of the increase in the price of good X will affect purchases of\n\ngood X\n\ngood Y",
