    "question": "A profit-maximizing firm that sells its output in a perfectly competitive market hires two additional workers, calculating that the contribution to total revenue of the last worker hired just equals the extra cost of hiring that worker. Six months later, the firm finds that the last worker’s contribution to total revenue is less than the extra cost of hiring that worker. Which of the following may have occurred in the interim to explain this change?",
