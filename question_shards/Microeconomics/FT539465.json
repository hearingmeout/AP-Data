    "description": "Assume that Alpha and Beta are the only sellers of a product and they do not cooperate. Each firm has to decide whether to raise the product price. The payoff matrix below gives the profits, in dollars, associated with each pair of pricing strategies. The first entry in each cell shows the profits to Alpha, and the second, the profits to Beta.",
    "question": "Assuming both firms know the information in the matrix, which of the following correctly describes the dominant strategy of each firm?",
