    "description": "Coldbox Corporation hires its workers in a perfectly competitive labor market and produces and sells frozen peas in a perfectly competitive product market. The market price for frozen peas is $4 per bag. The table below shows Coldbox’ short-run production of frozen peas. Labor is the only variable input. Coldbox Corporation’s fixed cost is $500.\n\nWhen Coldbox hires the second worker, does it experience diminishing returns? Explain.\n\nCalculate the average fixed cost if Coldbox hires 3 workers. Show your work.\n\nIf the wage is $200 per worker, identify the profit-maximizing number of workers for Coldbox. Explain using marginal analysis.\n\nIf the price of frozen peas decreases by $2 per bag, would the number of workers hired by Coldbox be more than, less than, or equal to the number of workers you identified in part (c) ? Explain.\n\nSuppose that Coldbox hires workers from a monopsonistic labor market. Would the wage be higher, lower, or equal to the equilibrium wage in a perfectly competitive labor market?",
