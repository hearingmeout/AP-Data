    "question": "Suppose that a consumer purchases two goods X and Y and that the marginal utility of X is MUx, the total utility of X is TUx, the marginal utility of Y is MUy, and the total utility of Y is TUy. If the prices of X and Y are Px and Py, respectively, which of the following expressions defines consumer equilibrium?",
