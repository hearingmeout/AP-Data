    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.\n\nThe diagram above shows the cost and revenue curves for a monopoly.\n\nHow does a monopolist determine its profit-maximizing level of output and price?\n\nUsing the information in the graph, identify each of the following for the monopolist.\n\nThe profit-maximizing level of output and price\n\nThe line segment of the demand curve that is elastic\n\nSuppose that the industry depicted in the graph became perfectly competitive without changing the demand or cost curves. Identify the equilibrium price and output that would prevail in the perfectly competitive market.\n\nUsing the information in the graph, identify the area of consumer surplus for each of the following.\n\nThe profit-maximizing monopoly\n\nThe perfectly competitive industry\n\nDefine allocative efficiency.\n\nTo be allocatively efficient, what level of output should the monopolist produce?\n\nShould the government use a per-unit tax or a per-unit subsidy to lead the monopolist to produce the allocatively efficient level of output? Explain how this tax or subsidy would achieve the allocatively efficient level of output.",
