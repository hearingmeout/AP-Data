    "description": "Identify the relationship between price and marginal revenue and explain why this relationship exists for each of the following.\n\nA perfectly competitive firm\n\nMonopoly\n\nA firm's market power is sometimes measured by using the following formula\n\n(P-MC) / P\n\nwhere P is price and MC is marginal cost at the profit-maximizing output level. Some economists claim the larger value of the index, the greater the firm's marker power.\n\nExplain why this index is always positive for an imperfectly competitive market.\n\nUsing the formula, calculate the market power of any perfectly competitive firm.",
