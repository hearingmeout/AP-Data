    "question": "Assume that a profit-maximizing firm is perfectly competitive in both the output and the factor markets and is at its long-run equilibrium. The firm's output is 100 units, its total revenue is $600.00, and the fixed cost of production is $50.00. Based on this information, which of the following is true for the firm?",
