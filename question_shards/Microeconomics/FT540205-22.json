    "description": "Theresa consumes both bagels and toy cars.\n\nThe table above shows Theresa's marginal utility from bagels and toy cars.\n\nWhat is her total utility from purchasing three toy cars?\n\nTheresa's weekly income is $11, price of a bagel is $2, and the price of a toy car is $1. What quantity of bagels and toy cars will maximize Theresa's utility if she spends her entire weekly income on bagels and toy cars? Explain your answer using marginal analysis.\n\nAssume that the price of wheat, an input for the production of bagels, increases. Will Theresa's demand for bagels increase, decrease, or not change? Explain.\n\nSuppose that Theresa's income elasticity for bagels is -0.2.Does the value of Theresa's income elasticity indicate that bagels are normal goods, inferior goods, substitutes, or complements?\n\nSuppose that when the price of toy cars increases by 10 percent, Theresa buys 5 percent fewer toy cars and 4 percent less of a different toy, blocks. Calculate the cross-price elasticity for toy cars and blocks and indicate if it is positive or negative.",
