    "description": "Sugar is freely traded in the world market. Assume that a country, Loriland, is a price taker in the world market for sugar. Some of the sugar consumed in Loriland is produced domestically while the rest is imported. The world price of sugar is $2 per pound. The graph below shows Loriland's sugar market, and Pw represents the world price.\n\nAt the world price of $2 per pound, how much sugar is Loriland importing?\n\nSuppose that Loriland imposes a per-unit tariff on sugar imports and the new domestic price including the tariff is $4.\n\nIdentify the new level of domestic production.\n\nCalculate the domestic consumer surplus for Loriland. You must show your work.\n\nCalculate the total tariff revenue collected by the government. You must show your work.\n\nGiven the world price of $2, what per-unit tariff maximizes the sum of Loriland's domestic consumer surplus and producer surplus?",
