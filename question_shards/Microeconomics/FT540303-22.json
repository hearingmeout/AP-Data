    "description": "In answering the question, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. All diagrams should be clearly labeled.\n\nIn the country of Lola, sugar had always been produced in a perfectly competitive industry until a dictator seized power and monopolized the production of sugar.\n\nDraw a graph that shows the output and price the monopolist would choose to maximize profits.\n\nThe people of Lola revolt, imprison the dictator, and repeal the law restricting the number of sellers of sugar.\n\nExplain two conditions that might lead to an increase in the number of sugar sellers after the repeal of the law.\n\nDescribe how an individual seller would determine the profit-maximizing output level of sugar if the sugar industry were perfectly competitive.\n\nGiven your answers in parts (a) and (c), is the repeal of the law likely to make the sugar industry more efficient? Why? In your explanation be sure to include an explanation of economic efficiency.",
