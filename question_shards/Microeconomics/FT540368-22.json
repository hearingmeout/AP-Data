    "description": "In answering the questions, you should emphasize the line of reasoning that generated your results; it is not enough to list the results of your analysis. Include diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. All diagrams should be clearly labeled.\n\nUsing one graph for a monopoly firm and one for a perfectly competitive firm, draw and label the demand curve and the marginal revenue-curve for each of these firms.\n\nFor the perfectly competitive (a price taker) firm, explain why the relationship between demand and marginal revenue exists.\n\nFor the monopoly firm, explain why the relationship between demand and marginal revenue exists.",
