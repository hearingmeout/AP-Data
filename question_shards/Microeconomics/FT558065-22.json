    "description": "Martha has a fixed budget of $20, and she spends it all on two goods, X and Y. The price of X is $4 per unit, and the price of Y is $2 per unit. The table below shows the total benefit, measured in dollars, Martha receives from the consumption of each good.\n\nWhat is Martha’s marginal benefit of the fifth unit of good X?\n\nCalculate the total consumer surplus if Martha consumes 5 units of X. Show your work.\n\nMartha is currently consuming 4 units of X and 2 units of Y. Use marginal analysis to explain why this combination is not optimal for Martha.\n\nWhat is Martha’s optimal combination of goods X and Y?\n\nIndicate whether each of the following will cause the optimal quantity of good Y to increase, decrease, or stay the same.\n\nThe price of good Y doubles.\n\nMartha’s income falls to $10 with no changes in prices.\n\nMartha’s income doubles, and the price of both goods double.",
