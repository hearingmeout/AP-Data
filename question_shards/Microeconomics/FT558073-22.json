Calculate consumer surplus at the equilibrium price. Show your work. Now suppose the government imposes a per-unit tax of $1 on producers. What happens to total revenue received by producers after they pay the tax to the government? Explain. Will producer surplus increase, decrease, or stay the same? Will total surplus increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain.",
