    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question. What two potential sources of market failure exist in the market for Zhao’s zizzles? Explain each potential source of market failure using the information in the graph. Using numerical values from the graph, identify Zhao’s profit-maximizing quantity and price. Assume a $15 per-unit tax is imposed on the zizzles market. Using numerical values from the graph, identify Zhao’s profit-maximizing quantity and price. Zhao opposes the $15 per-unit tax analyzed above in part (c) and instead proposes a policy of no government intervention. If economic advisers are only interested in maximizing social welfare, would they support the policy of no government intervention? Explain.",
