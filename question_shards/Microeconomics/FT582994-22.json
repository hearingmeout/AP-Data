    "description": "1. The graph below depicts the market conditions Zhao, Inc., faces in the zizzles market, where D = demand, MSB = marginal social benefit, MR = marginal revenue, MSC = marginal social cost, and MPC = marginal private cost.\n\nDirections: You are advised to spend the first 10 minutes reading all of the questions and planning your answers. You will then have 50 minutes to answer all three of the following questions. You may begin writing your responses before the reading period is over. It is suggested that you spend approximately half your time on the first question and divide the remaining time equally between the next two questions.Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. Use a pen with black or dark blue ink.",
    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question.\n\nWhat two potential sources of market failure exist in the market for Zhao’s zizzles? Explain each potential source of market failure using the information in the graph.\n\nUsing numerical values from the graph, identify Zhao’s profit-maximizing quantity and price.\n\nAssume a $15 per-unit tax is imposed on the zizzles market. Using numerical values from the graph, identify Zhao’s profit-maximizing quantity and price.\n\nZhao opposes the $15 per-unit tax analyzed above in part (c) and instead proposes a policy of no government intervention. If economic advisers are only interested in maximizing social welfare, would they support the policy of no government intervention? Explain.",
