    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question. Directions: You are advised to spend the first 10 minutes reading all of the questions and planning your answers. You will then have 50 minutes to answer all three of the following questions. You may begin writing your responses before the reading period is over. It is suggested that you spend approximately half your time on the first question and divide the remaining time equally between the next two questions.Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. Use a pen with black or dark blue ink. Assume milk is produced and sold in a perfectly competitive market. To help milk producers, the government imposes an effective price floor on milk. Assume milk producers continue to sell milk only to households after the imposition of the price floor. Draw a correctly labeled graph for the milk market and show the price floor, labeled PF , and the quantity of milk purchased by households, labeled QF. Is the market for milk allocatively efficient after the price floor is imposed? Explain. On your graph from part (a), shade the area that represents total producer surplus after the price floor is imposed. Assume the absolute value of price elasticity of demand for milk is 2 throughout the price range. Would total consumer spending on milk increase, decrease, not change, or be indeterminate after the imposition of the price floor? Explain. Assume the price floor in the milk market caused the equilibrium price of eggs, a related consumption good, to increase. Draw a correctly labeled graph of the egg market, and show the effect of the price floor in the milk market on the egg market. What economic term describes the relationship between milk and egg?",
