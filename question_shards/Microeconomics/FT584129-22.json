    "description": "Breadbasket and Quicklunch are the only two sandwich shops serving a small town. Each shop can choose to set a high price or a low price for sandwiches. The payoff matrix below shows the daily profits for each combination of prices that the two shops could choose. The first entry shows Breadbasket’s profits, and the second entry shows Quicklunch’s profits. Assuming that both shops know the information shown in the matrix, answer the following.\n\nDoes each shop have a dominant strategy to set a high price, a dominant strategy to set a low price, or does it have no dominant strategy?\n\nBreadbasket\n\nQuicklunch\n\nIf the two shops do not cooperate on setting prices, what will be the profit for each shop?\n\nBreadbasket\n\nQuicklunch\n\nThe town government is concerned that food prices are too high. It decides to give a daily subsidy of $20 to any shop that chooses to set a low price for its food items. Redraw the payoff matrix under the government subsidy system.\n\nUsing your redrawn payoff matrix, answer each of the following.\n\nWould Quicklunch choose to set a high price or a low price? Explain using specific values from your redrawn matrix.\n\nWould the profits for Breadbasket increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain with a comparison to your answer in part (b)(i). Use the specific values.",
