    "description": "The graph below shows the market for widgets. The government is considering intervening in this market.\n\nCalculate the total producer surplus at the market equilibrium price and quantity. Show your work.\n\nIf the government imposes a price floor at $16, is there a shortage, a surplus, or neither? Explain.\n\nIf instead the government imposes a price ceiling at $12, is there a shortage, a surplus, or neither? Explain.\n\nIf instead the government restricts the market output to 10 units, calculate the deadweight loss. Show your work.\n\nAssume the price decreases from $20 to $12.\n\nCalculate the price elasticity of demand. Show your work.\n\nIn this price range, is demand perfectly elastic, relatively elastic, unit elastic, relatively inelastic, or perfectly inelastic?",
