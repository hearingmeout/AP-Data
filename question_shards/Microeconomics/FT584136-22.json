    "description": "The graph below shows the demand curve (D), marginal revenue curve (MR), marginal cost curve (MC), average total cost curve (ATC), and long-run average total cost curve (LRATC) for a monopolist.\n\nUsing the numbers given in the graph, identify each of the following for the profit-maximizing monopolist.\n\nThe quantity produced\n\nThe price\n\nThe allocatively efficient quantity\n\nAt the profit-maximizing quantity from part (a)(i), is the monopolist experiencing economies of scale? Explain.\n\nNow assume that the monopolist produces 10 units. Using the numbers given in the graph, calculate each of the following. Show your work.\n\nThe monopolist’s economic profit\n\nThe consumer surplus\n\nThe deadweight loss\n\nAt what quantity is demand unit elastic?\n\nSuppose the monopolist perfectly price discriminates and chooses the quantity that maximizes profit. Determine the dollar value of each of the following.\n\nThe monopolist’s profit\n\nThe consumer surplus",
