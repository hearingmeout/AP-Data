The firm is currently selling its product at the market price of $5.\n\nCalculate the marginal (physical) product of the third worker.\n\nDefine the law of diminishing marginal returns and explain why it occurs.\n\nDiminishing marginal returns first occur with the hiring of which worker for the firm?\n\nWhat is the highest daily wage that the firm is willing to pay to hire the fifth worker?\n\nWhat will happen to the demand for labor if the market price of the product increases?
