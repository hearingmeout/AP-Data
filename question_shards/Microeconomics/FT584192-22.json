    "description": "Assume that two firms are operating with identical cost schedules, but one firm is in a perfectly competitive industry, and the other is in a monopolistically competitive industry.\n\nUsing two correctly labeled graphs, show the long-run equilibrium price and output levels for each of these two firms.\n\nCompare the long-run equilibrium price and output levels for these two firms.\n\nWhat level of economic profit will each firm earn in the long run? Why do these results occur?\n\nFor each of the two firms at the equilibrium quantity, indicate whether the firm’s demand curve is perfectly elastic, elastic, unit elastic, inelastic or perfectly inelastic. How can you tell?",
