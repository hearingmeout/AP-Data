Explain.\n\nIs the supply of good X relatively elastic, relatively inelastic, unit elastic, perfectly elastic, or perfectly inelastic when the price decreases from $30 to $20 ? Explain.\n\nIf a per-unit tax is imposed on good X, how is the burden of the tax distributed between the buyers and sellers of good X?\n\nAssume that the income elasticity of demand for good Y is –2. Using a correctly labeled graph of the market for good Y, show the effect of a significant increase in income on the equilibrium price of good Y in the short run.",
