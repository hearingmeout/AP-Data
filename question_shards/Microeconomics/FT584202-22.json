    "description": "The graph above illustrates the market for calculators. S denotes the current supply curve, and D denotes the demand curve.\n\nCalculate the producer surplus before the tax.\n\nNow assume a per-unit tax of $2 is imposed whose impact is shown in the graph above.\n\nCalculate the amount of tax revenue.\n\nWhat is the after-tax price that the sellers now keep?\n\nCalculate the producer surplus after the tax.\n\nIs the demand price elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic between the prices of $5 and $6 ? Explain.\n\nAssuming no externalities, how does the tax affect allocative efficiency? Explain.",
