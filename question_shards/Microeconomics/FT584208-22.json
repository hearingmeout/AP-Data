    "question": "Sasha is a utility-maximizing consumer who spends all of her income on peanuts and bananas, both of which are normal goods.\n\nAssume that the last unit of peanuts consumed increased Sasha’s total utility from 40 utils to 48 utils and that the last unit of bananas consumed increased her total utility from 52 utils to 56 utils.\n\nIf the price of a unit of peanuts is $1 and Sasha is maximizing utility, calculate the price of a unit of bananas.\n\nIf the price of a unit of peanuts increases and the price of a unit of bananas remains unchanged from the price you determined in part (a)(i), how will Sasha’s purchase of peanuts change?\n\nAssume that the cross-price elasticity of demand between peanuts and bananas is positive. A widespread disease has destroyed the banana crop. What will happen to the equilibrium price and quantity of peanuts in the short run? Explain.\n\nAssume that the price of bananas increases.\n\nWill the substitution effect increase, decrease, or have no effect on the quantity of bananas demanded?\n\nWhat happens to Sasha’s real income?",
