    "description": "Market structures differ from one another in many respects. Consider two profit-maximizing firms that earn short-run economic profits. One is a perfectly competitive firm and the other is a monopoly.\n\nFor each firm, draw a correctly labeled graph showing the following.\n\nPrice\n\nQuantity of output\n\nArea of economic profits\n\nFor each firm, explain the relationship between price and marginal revenue.\n\nFor each firm, explain how the economic profits would most likely change in the long run.\n\nLabel the area that represents the deadweight loss on the graph for the monopoly firm drawn in (a). Explain what this deadweight loss represents.",
