Explain.\n\nPrice\n\nSuppose the government regulates the firm’s price to produce the allocatively efficient level of output. Using the labeling on the graph, identify each of the following.\n\nThe price the government would require the firm to set\n\nThe allocatively efficient level of output\n\nSuppose the firm produces at the allocatively efficient level of output.\n\nWould it be earning a profit or incurring a loss? Explain.\n\nUsing the labeling on the graph, identify the area of the profit or loss at the allocatively efficient level of output.\n\nUsing the labeling on the graph, identify the consumer surplus at the allocatively efficient level of output.\n\nSuppose the regulators establish a price that allows the firm to just cover all its opportunity costs. Using the labeling on the graph, identify the price the regulators would set to achieve this objective.",
