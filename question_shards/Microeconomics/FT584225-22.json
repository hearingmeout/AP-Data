    "description": "Assume that the cellular telephone industry is monopolistically competitive.\n\nAssume that cellular telephone manufacturers are earning short-run economic profits. Draw a correctly labeled graph for a typical firm in the industry and show each of the following.\n\nThe profit-maximizing output and price\n\nThe area representing economic profit\n\nAt the profit-maximizing price you identified in part (a), would the typical firm’s demand curve be price inelastic? Explain.\n\nGiven the information in part (a), what happens to the demand curve for the typical firm in the long run? Explain.\n\nUsing a new correctly labeled graph, show the profit-maximizing output and price for the typical firm in the long run.\n\nDoes the typical firm produce an output level that minimizes its average total cost in the long run?\n\nIn long-run equilibrium, does the typical firm produce the allocatively efficient level of output?
