    "description": "Two airline companies, Airtouch and Windward, operate a route from City X to City Y, transporting a mix of passengers and freight. They must file their schedules with the National Transportation Board each year and cannot alter them during that year. Those schedules are revealed only after both companies have filed. Each airline must choose between a morning and an evening departure. The relevant payoff matrix appears below, with the first entry in each cell indicating Airtouch’s daily profit and the second entry in each cell indicating Windward’s daily profit.\n\nIn which market structure do these firms operate? Explain.\n\nIf Windward chooses an evening departure, which departure time is better for Airtouch?\n\nIdentify the dominant strategy for Windward.\n\nIs choosing an evening departure a dominant strategy for Airtouch? Explain.\n\nIf both firms know all of the information in the payoff matrix but do not cooperate, what will be Windward’s daily profit?",
