    "description": "There is one art museum on the island of Watsonia. The museum’s demand and cost curves are shown in the graph above. The museum currently relies on an admission charge for some of its funding. Its directors are debating about how to set the admission charge.\n\nUsing the labeling of the graph above, identify the price and quantity associated with the following objectives.\n\nThe museum maximizes its profit.\n\nThe museum maximizes its total revenue.\n\nThe museum maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n\nThe museum maximizes its attendance, as long as it breaks even.\n\nWhen the attendance is Q1, is the demand price elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic? Explain.\n\nAssume that the price is set at P2. Assuming the existence of an opportunity cost, indicate whether the museum’s accounting profits would be positive, negative, or zero. Explain why.\n\nAssume that the government decides the museum should charge no admission and agrees to subsidize the museum for any losses.\n\nUsing the labeling in the graph, identify the museum’s attendance under that circumstance.\n\nWould the outcome be allocatively efficient? Explain.",
