Redraw your graph in part (a), and label the ceiling price as P2. Completely shade the area representing the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus after the imposition of the price ceiling.\n\nSuppose the demand for home security systems decreases and the price ceiling remains binding. Indicate what will happen to each of the following.\n\nConsumer surplus\n\nProducer surplus",
