    "description": "Assume that HZRad Company produces clock radios as shown in the short-run production function in the table above. HZRad can sell all the clock radios it produces at a market price of $20 each and can hire all the unskilled labor it needs at a wage of $90 per day per worker. Assume also that labor is the only variable input.\n\nUsing the specific information above, draw a correctly labeled graph of HZRad’s current supply curve for unskilled labor.\n\nWhat is HZRad’s profit-maximizing output level? Explain.\n\nSuppose that HZRad is the first company to use a new technology that increases the productivity of its unskilled workers.\n\nHow will the new technology affect the quantity of unskilled labor HZRad hires? Explain.\n\nHow will the new technology affect the wage paid to HZRad’s unskilled workers?",
