    "description": "Two bus companies, Roadway and Rankin Wheels, operate a route from Greensboro to Spring City, transporting a mix of passengers and freight. They must file their schedules with the local transportation board each year and cannot alter them during that year. Those schedules are revealed only after both companies have filed. Each company must choose between an early and a late departure. The relevant payoff matrix appears below, with the first entry in each cell indicating Roadway’s daily profit and the second entry in each cell indicating Rankin Wheels’ daily profit.\n\nIn which market structure do these firms operate? Explain.\n\nIf Roadway chooses an early departure, which departure time is better for Rankin Wheels?\n\nIdentify the dominant strategy for Roadway.\n\nIs choosing an early departure a dominant strategy for Rankin Wheels? Explain.\n\nIf both firms know all of the information in the payoff matrix but do not cooperate, what will be Rankin Wheels’ daily profit?",
