    "description": "Umbrellas are produced by a perfectly competitive, constant-cost industry. In the short run, the equilibrium price is $7 per umbrella and the typical firm is operating with a loss. The typical firm has the total cost function shown in the table below.\n\nUsing a correctly labeled graph, draw the demand curve for a typical firm in this industry.\n\nUsing the data above, determine each of the following for the typical firm.\n\nTotal fixed cost\n\nThe loss-minimizing level of output\n\nThe value of losses at the output level you found in part (b)(ii)\n\nExplain why the typical firm chooses to operate despite incurring a loss in the short run.\n\nIf the total cost per day remains unchanged in the long run, what is the long-run equilibrium price for umbrellas?",
