    "description": "Assume soybeans are produced by a perfectly competitive, constant-cost industry. Fresh Farm is a typical firm producing soybeans and is currently operating with an economic loss.\n\nUsing a correctly labeled graph for Fresh Farm, show each of the following in the short run.\n\nThe marginal cost curve and average total cost, labeled MC and ATC, respectively\n\nFresh Farm’s price and loss-minimizing quantity, labeled PF and QF, respectively\n\nThe average variable cost curve, labeled AVC\n\nSuppose that newspapers have recently reported that excessive soybean consumption can cause health problems. As a result, will the new loss-minimizing quantity for Fresh Farm be greater than, less than, or equal to QF in the short run? Explain.\n\nIs the long-run market supply for soybeans perfectly inelastic, relatively inelastic, unit elastic, relatively elastic, or perfectly elastic?\n\nAssume now that the soybean market is in a long-run equilibrium and that fertilizers used in soybean production cause water pollution. Using a correctly labeled graph for the soybean market, show each of the following.\n\nMarket equilibrium quantity and price, labeled QM and PM\n\nMarginal social cost curve, labeled MSC\n\nSocially optimal quantity, labeled QS\n\nThe area representing deadweight loss, shaded completely",
