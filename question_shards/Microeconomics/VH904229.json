    "question": "An economy produces two goods: X and Y. Its production possibilities curve is linear with the intercept on the Y axis at 1,000 units and the intercept on the X axis at 100 units. Which of the following statements is correct?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There is an increasing opportunity cost of producing good X, beginning with 1 unit of X costing 0.1 unit of Y.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is an increasing opportunity cost of producing good Y but not of producing good X, which has a constant opportunity cost.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is a constant opportunity cost with each unit of good X costing 10 units of good Y.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is a constant opportunity cost with 10 units of good X costing 1 unit of good Y.",

        "label": "With a linear production possibilities curve, total production of goods X and Y will be the same at each point on the curve.",
