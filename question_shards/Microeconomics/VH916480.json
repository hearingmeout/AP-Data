    "question": "Suppose that Habib has a weekly fixed budget and spends it all on music downloads and snacks. At his current combination of consumption, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on music downloads is greater than the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on snacks. Has Habib maximized his utility?",

        "label": "Yes, because he has purchased the two goods in proportion so that he can get the maximum utility from each.",
