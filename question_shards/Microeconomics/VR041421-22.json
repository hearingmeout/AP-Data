    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe graph above shows the cost and revenue curves for a natural monopoly that provides electrical power to the town of Fanaland. If unregulated, the monopolist operates to maximize its profit.\n\n(a) Identify the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity and price.\n\n(b) Assume the town government of Fanaland regulates the monopolist’s price to achieve the allocatively efficient quantity. What price would the government set in order to achieve the allocatively efficient quantity?\n\n(c) Will producing the allocatively efficient quantity be economically feasible for the monopolist? Explain.\n\n(d) Suppose instead the town government wants to regulate the monopolist to earn zero economic profit. What price would the government set to have the monopolist earn zero economic profit?\n\n(e) Based on your answer to part (d), will the deadweight loss increase, decrease, or stay the same as that of the unregulated monopolist?
