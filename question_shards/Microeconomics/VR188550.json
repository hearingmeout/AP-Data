    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nIn the small country of Anconia, shoes are produced in a perfectly competitive industry. The equilibrium market price for shoes is <math alttext=\"$50\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>50</mn></math> per pair. Anconia does not currently trade with other countries.\n\n(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph of the shoe market in Anconia and indicate the following.\n\n(i) The equilibrium price in Anconia, labeled <math alttext=\"$50\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>50</mn></math>\n\n(ii) The equilibrium quantity in Anconia, labeled <math alttext=\"Q sub F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\n(b) Now assume that Anconia opens its shoe market to international trade and starts trading shoes with other countries at the world price of <math alttext=\"$30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>30</mn></math> per pair.\n\n(i) On your graph in part (a), show each of the following for the shoe market in Anconia.\n\n- The world price of shoes, labeled <math alttext=\"$30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>30</mn></math>\n\n- The quantity of shoes supplied by producers in Anconia, labeled <math alttext=\"Q sub P \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>P</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\n- The total quantity of shoes purchased by domestic consumers in Anconia, labeled <math alttext=\"Q sub C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\n(ii) Using labels from your graph, identify the quantity of shoes imported by Anconia.\n\n(iii) Did consumers of shoes in Anconia benefit from opening up the shoe market to trade? Explain.\n\n(iv) On your graph in part (a), show the domestic producer surplus in Anconia with trade, shaded completely.\n\n(c) Now assume that the government of Anconia places a tariff on imported shoes. Relative to the free-trade outcomes in part (b), identify whether the following would increase, decrease, or remain the same as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\n(i) The price of shoes in Anconia\n\n(ii) The producer surplus of domestic shoe producers in Anconia\n\n(d) Explain why a government might prefer to impose a tariff rather than an import quota.",
