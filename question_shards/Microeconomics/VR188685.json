    "question": "Downtown Tech Company and Uptown Tech Company compete in the gaming console market. Downtown Tech Company is deciding whether to charge a high price or a low price for its product. Uptown Tech Company is deciding whether to invest in research and development or advertising. Each company’s profit depends on the actions taken by the other firm, which are listed in the payoff matrix provided. The first entry in the matrix is Downtown Tech Company’s profit, and the second is Uptown Tech Company’s profit. Each firm independently and simultaneously selects an action. Each firm knows all of the information about the payoffs associated with the strategies each firm can choose.\n\nUptown Tech Company\n\nResearch and Development\n Advertising\n\nDowntown Tech Company\n High Price\n <math alttext=\"$500 comma $250\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>500</mn><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>250</mn></math>\n <math alttext=\"$100 comma $700\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>100</mn><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>700</mn></math>\n\nLow Price\n <math alttext=\"$200 comma $400\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>200</mn><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>400</mn></math>\n <math alttext=\"$600 comma $350\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>600</mn><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">$</mi><mn>350</mn></math>\n\nThe Nash equilibrium to this game, if one exists, is which of the following?",
