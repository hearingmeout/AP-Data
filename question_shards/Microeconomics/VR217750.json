    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe table below shows the total variable costs faced by Raskin’s Clothing Store for different quantities of Good D sold.\n\nQuantity\n Total Variable Cost\n\n1\n $50\n\n2\n $105\n\n3\n $161\n\n4\n $218\n\n5\n $276\n\n6\n $335\n\n7\n $410\n\n8\n $540\n\n9\n $695\n\n10\n $875\n\nRaskin’s Clothing Store sells Good D in a perfectly competitive market with a downward-sloping demand curve and an upward-sloping supply curve. The market price is $150 per unit, and the total fixed cost is $85.\n\n(a) Identify the profit-maximizing quantity. Explain using marginal analysis.\n\n(b) Calculate the economic profit at the profit-maximizing quantity you identified in part (a). Show your work.\n\n(c) Calculate the average fixed cost of producing 10 units. Show your work.\n\n(d) Based on your answer to part (b), will the number of firms in the industry increase, decrease, or stay the same in the long run? Explain.\n\n(e) Based on your answer to part (b), will the market price increase, decrease, or stay the same in the long run? Explain.\n\n(f) The income elasticity of demand for Good D is 1.2, and the cross-price elasticity of demand for dresses with respect to the price of Good D is 0.2. Based on your answer to part (e), what will happen to the demand for dresses? Explain.\n\n(g) Now assume that the market in which Raskin’s Clothing Store operates is in long-run equilibrium.(i) Suppose the market demand for Good D increases. Will the profit-maximizing quantity of Good D for Raskin’s Clothing Store increase, decrease, or stay the same in the short run? Explain.(ii) Suppose instead the wages that Raskin’s Clothing Store pays its workers decrease. Will the profit-maximizing quantity of Good D for Raskin’s Clothing Store increase, decrease, or stay the same in the short run? Explain.",
