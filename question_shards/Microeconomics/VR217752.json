    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe table below shows the total costs faced by Kiyoshi’s Clothing Store for different quantities of Good F sold.\n\nQuantity\n Total Cost\n\n0\n $8\n\n1\n $18\n\n2\n $32\n\n3\n $48\n\n4\n $72\n\n5\n $104\n\n6\n $144\n\n7\n $192\n\n8\n $248\n\n9\n $312\n\n10\n $384\n\nKiyoshi’s Clothing Store sells Good F in a perfectly competitive market with a downward-sloping demand curve and an upward-sloping supply curve. The market price is $60 per unit.\n\n(a) Calculate the average fixed cost of producing 4 units. Show your work.\n\n(b) Identify the profit-maximizing quantity. Explain using marginal analysis.\n\n(c) Calculate the economic profit at the profit-maximizing quantity you identified in part (b). Show your work.\n\n(d) Based on your answer to part (c), will the number of firms in the industry increase, decrease, or stay the same in the long run? Explain.\n\n(e) Based on your answer to part (c), will the market price increase, decrease, or stay the same in the long run? Explain.\n\n(f) The income elasticity of demand for Good F is 3, and the cross-price elasticity of demand for gloves with respect to the price of Good F is 0.5. Based on your answer to part (e), what will happen to the demand for gloves? Explain.\n\n(g) Now assume that the market in which Kiyoshi’s Clothing Store operates is in long-run equilibrium at a price of $50 per unit.(i) Suppose the government imposes a price floor at $55 per unit on the market for Good F. Will consumer surplus in the market for Good F increase, decrease, or stay the same in the short run as a result of the price floor? Explain.(ii) Suppose instead the cost of energy, a variable cost for Kiyoshi’s Clothing Store, increases. Will the profit-maximizing quantity of Good F for Kiyoshi’s Clothing Store increase, decrease, or stay the same in the short run? Explain.",
