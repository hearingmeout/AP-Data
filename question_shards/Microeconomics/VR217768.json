    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nUse the graph provided below to answer parts (a)-(e).\n\nEarthScience, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on a carbon capture technology, making it the only producer of that technology. The graph above shows EarthScience’s demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.\n\n(a) Calculate EarthScience’s total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. Show your work.\n\n(b) Starting at a price of $30, if EarthScience were to increase the price by 6%, will the quantity demanded decrease by more than 6%, by less than 6%, or by exactly 6%? Explain.\n\n(c) At a quantity of 20 units, is EarthScience’s marginal product increasing, decreasing, or constant? Explain.\n\n(d) Identify the quantity that maximizes EarthScience’s profit. Explain.\n\n(e) At the quantity identified in part (d), does EarthScience earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.\n\nAssume that EarthScience’s patent expires. GeoSci, a company with the capability to produce the same technology as EarthScience, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than EarthScience for the technology. EarthScience is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match GeoSci’s price. GeoSci is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.\n\nThe matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (EarthScience and GeoSci) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents EarthScience’s payoff and the second entry represents GeoSci’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy. Use the matrix provided below to answer parts (f)-(h).\n\nGeoSci\n\nAdvertise\n Not Advertise\n\nEarthScience\n Maintain Price\n $520,$460\n $400, $250\n\nLower Price\n $450, $350\n $320, $650\n\n(f) Does EarthScience have a dominant strategy? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.\n\n(g) Identify the Nash equilibrium. Explain why this is a Nash equilibrium using information from the payoff matrix.\n\n(h) Suppose GeoSci makes a credible commitment to EarthScience that if EarthScience lowers its price, then GeoSci will pay EarthScience $150. Will this offer result in a Nash equilibrium with different strategies from those identified in part (g) ? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.",
