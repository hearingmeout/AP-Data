    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nUse the graph provided below to answer parts (a)-(e).\n\nMemorEyes, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on a learning aid, making it the only producer of that learning aid. The graph above shows MemorEyes’ demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.\n\n(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes MemorEyes’ profit. Explain.\n\n(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does MemorEyes earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.\n\n(c) Calculate MemorEyes’ total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. Show your work.\n\n(d) At a price of $40, will MemorEyes continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.\n\n(e) Assume that at 30 units, the average total cost is $120. If the total rent paid by MemorEyes increases by $450, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. Show your work.\n\nAssume that MemorEyes’ patent expires. Cognitz, a company with the capability to produce the same learning aid as MemorEyes, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than MemorEyes for the learning aid. MemorEyes is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match Cognitz’ price. Cognitz is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.\n\nThe matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (MemorEyes and Cognitz) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents MemorEyes’ payoff and the second entry represents Cognitz’ payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy. Use the matrix provided below to answer parts (f)-(h).\n\nCognitz\n\nNot Advertise\n Advertise\n\nMemorEyes\n Lower Price\n $3,000 , $3,400\n $4,000 , $2,500\n\nMaintain Price\n $2,000 , $6,500\n $3,000 , $8,500\n\n(f) Does Cognitz have a dominant strategy? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.\n\n(g) Identify the Nash equilibrium. Explain why this is a Nash equilibrium using information from the payoff matrix.\n\n(h) Suppose Cognitz makes a credible commitment to MemorEyes that if MemorEyes maintains its price, then Cognitz will pay MemorEyes $1,500. Will this offer result in a Nash equilibrium with different strategies from those identified in part (g) ? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.",
