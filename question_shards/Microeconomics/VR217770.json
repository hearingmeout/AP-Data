    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nUse the graph provided below to answer parts (a)-(e).\n\nNanoWare, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on software, making it the only producer of that software. The graph above shows NanoWare’s demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.\n\n(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes NanoWare’s profit. Explain.\n\n(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does NanoWare earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.\n\n(c) Calculate NanoWare’s total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. Show your work.\n\n(d) At a price of $26, will NanoWare continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.\n\n(e) Assume that at 72 units, the average total cost is $22. If the total advertising costs paid by NanoWare increase by $216, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. Show your work.\n\nAssume that NanoWare’s patent expires. HotCode, a company with the capability to produce the same software as NanoWare, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than NanoWare for the software. NanoWare is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match HotCode’s price. HotCode is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.\n\nThe matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (NanoWare and HotCode) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents NanoWare’s payoff and the second entry represents HotCode’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy. Use the matrix provided below to answer parts (f)-(h).\n\nHotCode\n\nNot Advertise\n Advertise\n\nNanoWare\n Lower Price\n $1,000 , $4,200\n $3,500 , $4,000\n\nMaintain Price\n $2,000 , $4,600\n $3,000 , $4,400\n\n(f) Does HotCode have a dominant strategy? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.\n\n(g) Identify the Nash equilibrium. Explain why this is a Nash equilibrium using information from the payoff matrix.\n\n(h) Suppose NanoWare makes a credible commitment to HotCode that if HotCode advertises, then NanoWare will pay HotCode $500. Will this offer result in a Nash equilibrium with different strategies from those identified in part (g) ? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.",
