    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nUse the graph provided below to answer parts (a)-(e).\n\nEyesOn, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on cameras, making it the only producer of that camera. The graph above shows EyesOn’s demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.\n\n(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes EyesOn’s profit. Explain.\n\n(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does EyesOn earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.\n\n(c) Calculate EyesOn’s total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. Show your work.\n\n(d) At a price of $10, will EyesOn continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.\n\n(e) Assume that at 44 units, the average total cost is $22. If the total wages paid by EyesOn increase by $220, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. Show your work.\n\nAssume that EyesOn’s patent expires. ViewTime, a company with the capability to produce the same camera as EyesOn, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than EyesOn for the camera. EyesOn is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match ViewTime’s price. ViewTime is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.\n\nThe matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (EyesOn and ViewTime) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents EyesOn’s payoff and the second entry represents ViewTime’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy. Use the matrix provided below to answer parts (f)-(h).\n\nViewTime\n\nNot Advertise\n Advertise\n\nEyesOn\n Lower Price\n $1,000 , $2,600\n $4,000 , $3,400\n\nMaintain Price\n $2,000 , $6,500\n $3,000 , $7,500\n\n(f) Does EyesOn have a dominant strategy? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.\n\n(g) Identify the Nash equilibrium. Explain why this is a Nash equilibrium using information from the payoff matrix.\n\n(h) Suppose ViewTime makes a credible commitment to EyesOn that if EyesOn maintains the price, then ViewTime will pay EyesOn $500. Will this offer result in a Nash equilibrium with different strategies from those identified in part (g) ? Explain using numbers from the payoff matrix.",
