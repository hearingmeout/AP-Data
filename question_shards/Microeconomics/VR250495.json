    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nUse the following graph to answer parts (a)-(e). Prices and costs are in dollars.\n\nThe graph above shows the demand (<math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>), marginal revenue (<math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>), marginal cost (<math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>), and average total cost (<math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry. Each firm sells a similar but not identical product.\n\n(a) At what quantity is the demand for this product unit elastic? Explain.\n\n(b) Use the relationship between the marginal cost curve and the average total cost curve to explain why the average total cost curve is increasing at <math alttext=\"12\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mn>12</mn></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math> units.\n\n(c) If the firm maximizes profit, identify the profit-maximizing quantity and price, and explain how you determined each.\n\n(d) Calculate the deadweight loss at the profit-maximizing quantity identified in part (c). Show your work.\n\n(e) Assume fixed cost increases by <math alttext=\"$4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>$</mi><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math>. Will the profit-maximizing quantity increase, decrease, or stay the same in the short run? Explain.",
