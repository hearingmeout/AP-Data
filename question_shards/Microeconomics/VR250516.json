    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe table below shows the marginal benefit, in dollars, that Kareem derives from consuming two goods, Good X and cereal.\n\nQuantity of Good X\n Marginal Benefit of Good X\n Quantity of Cereal\n Marginal Benefit of Cereal\n\n1\n $18\n 1\n $32\n\n2\n $16\n 2\n $28\n\n3\n $12\n 3\n $24\n\n4\n $6\n 4\n $20\n\n5\n $2\n 5\n $16\n\n6\n $0\n 6\n $12\n\nKareem has a limited weekly income of $18, and he spends it all on Good X and cereal. Assume the price of Good X is $2 per unit and the price of cereal is $4 per unit.\n\n(a) Given his weekly income, would Kareem be able to buy 3 units of Good X and 5 units of cereal? Explain using numbers.\n\n(b) Calculate the total consumer surplus from Good X if Kareem consumes 4 units of Good X. Show your work.\n\n(c) Identify the quantity of Good X and the quantity of cereal that will maximize Kareem’s total benefit given his weekly income. Explain using marginal analysis.\n\n(d) Assume Good X is produced in a perfectly competitive market and that there is a decrease in the number of consumers in the market for Good X.(i) Will the quantity of Good X that will maximize Kareem’s total benefit increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain.(ii) Would Kareem’s total consumer surplus from Good X if he consumes 4 units of Good X increase, decrease, or stay the same compared to your answer in part (b) ? Explain.",
