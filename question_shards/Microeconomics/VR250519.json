    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nTom’s Trims is the only barber shop in a small remote town, and Tom’s Trims is the only employer of barbers in the area. The graph below shows the market for barbers with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.\n\n(a) If the wage rate is $20, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of barbers and calculate its size. Show your work.\n\n(b) Identify the profit-maximizing number of barbers that Tom’s Trims will hire. Explain using the labeling on the graph.\n\n(c) Identify the profit-maximizing wage rate that Tom’s Trims will pay its barbers. Explain using the labeling on the graph.\n\n(d) Assume that the market for barbers becomes perfectly competitive. What wage rate would Tom’s Trims pay its barbers if it were a perfectly competitive firm? Explain using labeling on the graph.\n\n(e) Assume instead that Tom’s Trims uses both labor and capital in providing its services. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 80 cuts per day and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 120 cuts per day; the daily wage rate for labor is $20 and the daily rental price for capital is $40. To minimize the cost of producing its current level of output, should Tom’s Trims hire more barbers, fewer barbers, or the same number of barbers? Explain using marginal analysis.",
