    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe table below shows the marginal benefit, in dollars, that Yanick derives from consuming two goods, Good A and shirts.\n\nQuantity of Good A\n Marginal Benefit of Good A\n Quantity of Shirts\n Marginal Benefit of Shirts\n\n1\n $64\n 1\n $48\n\n2\n $40\n 2\n $40\n\n3\n $24\n 3\n $32\n\n4\n $12\n 4\n $24\n\n5\n $4\n 5\n $16\n\n6\n $0\n 6\n $8\n\nYanick has a limited weekly income of $10, and he spends it all on Good A and shirts. Assume the price of Good A is $2 per unit and the price of each shirt is $4.\n\n(a) Given his weekly income, would Yanick be able to buy 2 units of Good A and 2 shirts? Explain using numbers.\n\n(b) Calculate the total consumer surplus from Good A if Yanick consumes 3 units of Good A. Show your work.\n\n(c) Identify the quantity of Good A and the quantity of shirts that will maximize Yanick’s total benefit given his weekly income. Explain using marginal analysis.\n\n(d) Assume Good A is produced in a perfectly competitive market and that there is an increase in the number of consumers in the market for Good A.(i) Will the quantity of Good A that will maximize Yanick’s total benefit increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain.(ii) Would Yanick’s total consumer surplus from Good A if he consumes 3 units of Good A increase, decrease, or stay the same compared to your answer in part (b) ? Explain.",
