    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nMolly’s Motorcycles is the only motorcycle repair shop in a small remote town, and Molly’s Motorcycles is the only employer of mechanics in the area. The graph below shows the market for mechanics with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.\n\n(a) Identify the profit-maximizing number of mechanics that Molly’s Motorcycles will hire. Explain using the labeling on the graph.\n\n(b) Identify the profit-maximizing wage rate that Molly’s Motorcycles will pay its mechanics. Explain using the labeling on the graph.\n\n(c) If the wage rate is $38, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of mechanics and calculate its size. Show your work.\n\n(d) If the marginal product of mechanics decreases, what will happen to the quantity of services provided by Molly’s Motorcycles? Explain.\n\n(e) Assume instead that Molly’s Motorcycles uses both labor and capital in providing its services. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 100 repairs per day and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 60 repairs per day; the daily wage rate for labor is $20 and the daily rental price for capital is $30. To minimize the cost of providing its current level of service, should Molly’s Motorcycles rent more capital, less capital, or the same amount of capital? Explain using marginal analysis.",
