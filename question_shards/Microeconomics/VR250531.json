    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nVijay’s Veterinary is the only animal care facility in a small remote town, and Vijay’s Veterinary is the only employer of veterinarians in the area. The graph below shows the market for veterinarians with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.\n\n(a) Identify the profit-maximizing number of veterinarians that Vijay’s Veterinary will hire. Explain using the labeling on the graph.\n\n(b) Identify the profit-maximizing wage rate that Vijay’s Veterinary will pay its veterinarians. Explain using the labeling on the graph.\n\n(c) If the wage rate is $86, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of veterinarians and calculate its size. Show your work.\n\n(d) If the marginal product of veterinarians decreases, what will happen to the quantity of services provided by Vijay’s Veterinary? Explain.\n\n(e) Assume instead that Vijay’s Veterinary uses both labor and capital in providing its services. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 50 patients per day and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 10 patients per day; the daily wage rate for labor is $100 and the daily rental price for capital is $40. To minimize the cost of providing its current level of service, should Vijay’s Veterinary rent more capital, less capital, or the same amount of capital? Explain using marginal analysis.",
