A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.

If consumers’ incomes were to increase, what would happen to the socially optimal quantity of trees? Explain.\n(d) Instead, assume that the trees do not benefit the neighbors; rather, the leaves from trees planted by homeowners fall into their neighbors’ yards, costing the neighbors time and money to clean up. In the absence of government intervention, is the socially optimal quantity of these trees greater than, less than, or equal to the market equilibrium quantity? Explain.",
