    "question": "Consider two groups of workers in competitive labor markets. Workers in group X have a skill set unique to producing computers, and workers in group Y have a skill set that can be used to produce either computers or smartphones. When the price of smartphones decreases, the wages paid to workers producing smartphones decrease. Which of the following could happen to the wages of workers in group X?",
