Explain.\n\n(b) Using numbers from the graph, identify the price and quantity produced at which the monopolist earns zero economic profit.\n\n(c) Assume that regulators impose a price ceiling that results in the firm producing the socially optimal quantity in the short run.\n\n(i) Calculate the total revenue at the price ceiling. Show your work.\n\n(ii) Explain why the firm requires a subsidy to continue producing in the long run.\n\n(iii) Calculate the lump-sum subsidy that would be required for the monopolist to produce the socially optimal quantity in the long run.
