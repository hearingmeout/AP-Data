    "description": "Rover’s Rest and Dave’s Den are the only two dog daycare companies in a town. Each firm is considering whether to run ads or to not run ads. The first entry in each cell shows Dave’s Den’s profit, and the second entry shows Rover’s Rest’s profit. Each dog daycare company independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy. Assume the two firms know all the information in the matrix and do not cooperate. Use the payoff matrix provided to answer the next two questions.",
    "question": "The advertising agency raises its prices, causing a firm that chooses to run ads to earn $200 less in profits. Once the firms adjust to the higher advertising prices, what is the total combined profit of the two firms in the new Nash equilibrium?",
