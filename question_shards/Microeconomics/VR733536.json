    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe provided graph shows cost, revenue, and demand curves for a single-price monopolist that sells leather shoes. The fixed cost is zero, and the marginal cost is constant.\n\n(a) Identify the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity and price.\n\n(b) Calculate the monopolist’s economic profit at the profit-maximizing quantity. Show your work.\n\n(c) If the monopolist decides to produce 10 additional units beyond the profit-maximizing quantity identified in part (a), would total revenue increase, decrease, or remain the same? Explain.\n\n(d) Suppose the government breaks up the monopoly, resulting in a perfectly competitive market for leather shoes.\n\n(i) Identify the new equilibrium quantity and price.\n\n(ii) Calculate the total economic surplus.
