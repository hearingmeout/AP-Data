    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe provided graph shows the marginal private cost (MPC) curve, the marginal social cost (MSC) curve, the marginal private benefit (MPB) curve, and the marginal social benefit (MSB) curve in the market for smoke alarms.\n\n(a) Does the graph show a negative consumption externality or a positive consumption externality? Explain.\n\n(b) Identify the socially optimal quantity of smoke alarms.\n\n(c) What is the dollar value of the marginal externality?\n\n(d) Calculate the deadweight loss in the market for smoke alarms at the market equilibrium. Show your work.\n\n(e) The government wants the socially optimal quantity of smoke alarms to be produced and consumed. Would the government implement a per-unit tax on producers, a lump-sum subsidy to producers, a per-unit subsidy to consumers, or a lump-sum tax on consumers? Explain.",
