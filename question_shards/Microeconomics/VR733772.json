    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe graph provided shows the demand (d), marginal revenue (MR), average total cost (ATC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost (MC) curves for Hansel Hangout, a typical profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market producing Good X.\n\n(a) Calculate Hansel Hangout’s total fixed cost. Show your work.\n\n(b) Identify the price and Hansel Hangout’s profit-maximizing quantity of Good X.\n\n(c) Calculate Hansel Hangout’s economic profit at the quantity identified in part (b). Show your work.\n\n(d) As the market for Good X adjusts to the long-run equilibrium, what will happen to the price of Good X? Explain.\n\n(e) Assume the cross-price elasticity of demand between Good X and Good C is positive. Given the change in the long-run price of Good X in part (d), will the quantity demanded of Good C increase, decrease, or remain the same? Explain.",
