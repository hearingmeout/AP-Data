    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nKeepdry produces and sells rain jackets in a perfectly competitive product market at the price of $5 per jacket and hires all the workers it needs in a perfectly competitive labor market at the wage rate of $15. Labor is the only variable input, and the firm’s production schedule is provided in the table.\n\nNumber of Workers\n Quantity of Output\n\n0\n 0\n\n1\n 9\n\n2\n 20\n\n3\n 27\n\n4\n 32\n\n5\n 34\n\n6\n 35\n\n(a) Calculate the marginal revenue product of the second worker. Show your work.\n\n(b) Diminishing marginal returns will begin with the hiring of which worker?\n\n(c) Determine the profit-maximizing number of workers the firm should hire. Explain using marginal analysis.\n\n(d) Assuming Keepdry’s fixed cost is $40, calculate Keepdry’s economic profit when hiring the profit-maximizing number of workers. Show your work.\n\n(e) Suppose Keepdry’s fixed cost increases to $80. Will the profit-maximizing number of workers hired in the short run increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain.",
