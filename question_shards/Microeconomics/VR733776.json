    "description": "Include correctly labeled diagrams, if useful or required, in explaining your answers. A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.\n\nThe graph shows the cost and revenue curves for an unregulated, profit-maximizing monopoly.\n\n(a) Is the firm shown in this graph a natural monopoly? Explain.\n\n(b) Using the labeling from the graph, identify the area representing the deadweight loss for this profit-maximizing monopoly.\n\n(c) In order to improve resource allocation, the government sets a price that results in the firm earning zero economic profit.\n\n(i) Using the labeling from the graph, identify the price and resulting quantity the firm would produce.\n\n(ii) Will this government policy eliminate the deadweight loss? Explain using labeling from the graph.\n\n(d) Instead, the government decides to set a price that results in the socially optimal quantity of output. Will the firm earn positive, negative, or zero economic profit? Explain using labeling from the graph.",
