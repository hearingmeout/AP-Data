    "question": "Complete the bass line for the melody below, making sure to keep the portion you compose consistent with the first phrase. Place Roman numerals with inversion symbols below the bass line to indicate the harmonies implied by the soprano and bass. Observe the following: Your bass line should make melodic sense in relation to the given soprano line. Give melodic interest to the bass line. Vary the motion of the bass line in relation to the soprano. You may use note values ranging from half notes to eighth notes. Your bass line and chord choices should make harmonic sense with the melody. Use an appropriate cadence at each phrase ending. Use at least two chords or two positions of the same chord per measure. Do not notate alto and tenor lines.",
