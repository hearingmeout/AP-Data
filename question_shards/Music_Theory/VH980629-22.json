    "question": "You will hear a harmonic progression in four parts. Please do the following. 1. Notate only the soprano and bass voices. Do not notate the alto and tenor voices. 2. Make sure that any accidentals you use are appropriate for the key signature provided. 3. On the blanks provided under the staff, write the Roman and Arabic numerals that indicate the chords and their inversions. (Each blank should contain at least a Roman numeral, a figure, or a dash.) 4. Make sure to align your notes with the blanks provided. Notice that the soprano and bass notes and the Roman numeral of the first chord are given and that there is a blank provided for each of the other chords in the progression. Now listen to the progression for the first time and begin working. Suggested time: Play the harmonic progression four times, with a pause of 30 seconds after the first playing and a pause of 1 minute after each subsequent playing.",
