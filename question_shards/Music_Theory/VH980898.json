    "question": "Assignment: Sing the pitches in accurate rhythm and with a steady tempo.\n\nProcedure: You should use 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice and up to 30 seconds to perform the melody. You may play the starting pitch for the melody at the beginning of the practice period.\n\nYour performance:\n\n1. You may sing note names (C-D-E), syllable names (do-re-mi), scale-degree numbers (1-2-3), or a neutral syllable (for example, ta-ta-ta).\n\n2. Even though you will hear the starting pitch of the printed melody, you may transpose the melody to a key that is comfortable.\n\n3. You should use some of the practice time to perform out loud. You may write on the music if you wish.\n\n4. You may not use any device (for example, a metronome or a musical instrument) to assist you in your practice or performance.\n\n5. You will be evaluated on rhythmic accuracy, pitch accuracy (relative to tonic), and continuity (maintaining a steady tempo). You may start over, if you need to, but there will be a deduction from your score. You will not be evaluated on the quality of your singing voice.\n\nLook over the melody, practice the melody, and then perform the melody.\n\nSuggested time: Play the starting pitch for the melody and then use 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice and up to 30 seconds to perform the melody.\n\nPrompt 1",
