There will be a pause of 30 seconds after the first playing and a one-minute pause after each subsequent playing. For each question, please do the following. (a) Notate only the soprano and bass voices. Do not notate the alto and tenor voices. (b) Make sure that any accidentals you use are appropriate for the key signature provided. (c) On the blanks provided under the staff, write the Roman and Arabic numerals that indicate the chords and their inversions. (Each blank should contain at least a Roman numeral, a figure, or a dash.) (d) Make sure to align your notes with the blanks provided. Question 3. Before listening to the first playing, please look at the staff below. Notice that there are nine chords in the progression; the soprano and bass notes and the Roman numeral of the first chord are given.
