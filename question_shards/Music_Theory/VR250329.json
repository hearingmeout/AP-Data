    "question": "Sight-Singing Melody 1.\n\nAssignment: For the given melody, sing the pitches in accurate rhythm and with a steady tempo.\n\nProcedure: You will have 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice and 30 seconds to perform the melody. You will hear the starting pitch for the melody at the beginning of the 1 minute and 15 second practice period. After the end of the practice period, you will have 30 seconds to perform the melody. A recorded announcement will alert you to the end of each practice and performance period. Directions on the recording will assist you in operating the recorder.\n\nYour performance:\n\na) You may sing note names (c-d-e), syllable names (do-re-mi), scale-degree numbers (1-2-3), or a neutral syllable (for example, ta-ta-ta).\n\nb) Even though you will hear the starting pitch of the printed melody, you may transpose the melody to a key that is comfortable.\n\nc) You should use some of the warm-up and practice time to perform out loud. You may write on the music if you wish.\n\nd) You may not use any device (for example, a metronome or a musical instrument) to assist you in your practice or performance.\n\ne) You will be evaluated on pitch accuracy (relative to tonic), rhythm, and continuity (maintaining a steady tempo). You may start over if you need to, but there will be a deduction from your score. You will not be evaluated on the quality of your singing voice.\n\nLook over the melody and begin practicing. You have 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice. This is the starting pitch of the printed melody.",
