    "question": "A person of mass 60 kg sliding along level ice at a speed of 3.0 m/s collides with a second person who is initially at rest. Assume that friction is negli-gible. If the two people hold onto each other and their common final speed after colliding is 2.0 m/s, the mass of the second person is",
