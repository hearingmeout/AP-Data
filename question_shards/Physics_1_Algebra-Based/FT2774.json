    "question": "A dog of mass 10 kg sits on a skateboard of mass 2 kg that is initially traveling south at 2 m/s. The dog jumps off with a velocity of 1 m/s north rela-tive to the ground. Which of the following is the best estimate of the velocity of the skateboard immediately after the dog has jumped?",
