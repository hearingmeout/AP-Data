    "question": "Two blocks of masses 1.0 kg and 2.0 kg, respectively, are pushed by a constant applied force F across a horizontal frictionless table with constant acceleration such that the blocks remain in contact with each other, as shown above. The 1.0 kg block pushes the 2.0 kg block with a force of 2.0 N. The acceleration of the two blocks is",
