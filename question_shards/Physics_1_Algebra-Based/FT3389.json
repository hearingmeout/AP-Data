    "question": "A block of mass 3.0 kg is hung from a spring, causing it to stretch 12 cm at equilibrium, as shown above. The 3.0 kg block is then replaced by a 4.0 kg block, and the new block is released from the position shown above, at which the spring is unstretched. How far will the 4.0 kg block fall before its direction is reversed?",
