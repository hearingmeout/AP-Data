    "question": "Two objects of mass 0.2 kg and 0.1 kg, respectively, move parallel to the x-axis, as shown above. The 0.2 kg object overtakes and collides with the 0.1 kg object. Immediately after the collision, the y-component of the velocity of the 0.2 kg object is 1 m/s upward. What is the y-component of the velocity of the 0.1 kg object immediately after the collision?",
