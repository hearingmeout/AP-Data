    "question": "Two small blocks, each of mass m, are connected by a string of constant length 4h and negligible mass. Block A is placed on a smooth tabletop as shown above, and block B hangs over the edge of the table. The tabletop is a distance 2h above the floor. Block B is then released from rest at a distance h above the floor at time t = 0. Express all algebraic answers in terms of h, m, and g. (a) Determine the acceleration of block B as it descends. (b) Block B strikes the floor and does not bounce. Determine the time t1 at which block B strikes the floor. (c) Describe the motion of block A from time t = 0 to the time when block B strikes the floor. (d) Describe the motion of block A from the time block B strikes the floor to the time block A leaves the table. (e) Determine the distance between the landing points of the two blocks.",
