    "question": "A heavy ball swings at the end of a string as shown above, with negligible air resistance. Point P is the lowest point reached by the ball in its motion, and point Q is one of the two highest points.\n\n(a) On the following diagrams draw and label vectors that could represent the velocity and acceleration of the ball at points P and Q. If a vector is zero, explicitly state this fact. The dashed lines indicate horizontal and vertical directions.\n\n(b) After several swings, the string breaks. The mass of the string and air resistance are negligible. On the following diagrams, sketch the path of the ball if the break occurs when the ball is at point P or point Q. In each case, briefly describe the motion of the ball after the break.",
