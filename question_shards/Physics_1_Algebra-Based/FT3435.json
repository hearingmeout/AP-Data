    "description": "A ball of mass m is attached to a vertical rod by two massless strings. The rod is rotated about its axis so that both strings are taut, with tensions T1 and T2, respectively. The strings and rod form the right triangle shown in the figure above. The ball rotates in a horizontal circle of radius r with speed v.",
    "question": "What is the tension T1 in the upper string?",
