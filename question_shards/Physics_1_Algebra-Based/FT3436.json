    "question": "A toy cannon of mass 1.0 kg is initially at rest on a horizontal surface when it launches a 0.05 kg projectile with a velocity of 10 m/s at an angle of 60° above the horizontal. What is the speed of the 1.0 kg cannon immediately after the projectile is released, assuming that friction is negligible?",
