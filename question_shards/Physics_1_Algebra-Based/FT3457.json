    "question": "A block on a horizontal surface of negligible friction is placed in contact with an ideal spring, as shown above. The block is moved to the left so that the spring is compressed a distance x from equilibrium and then released from rest. The block has kinetic energy K1 when it separates from the spring. When the spring is compressed a distance 2x and the block is released from rest, the kinetic energy of the block when it separates from the spring is",
