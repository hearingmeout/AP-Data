    "question": "A spaceship is traveling from Earth to the Moon. Which of the following is true of the gravitational force on the ship due to the two objects when the ship is equidistant from Earth and the Moon?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There is no net force because the ship is beyond the influence of Earth and the Moon.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is no net force because the forces exerted by Earth and the Moon balance.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is a net force because the force exerted by Earth is smaller than that exerted by the Moon.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is a net force because the force exerted by Earth is greater than that exerted by the Moon.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There is a net force because the ship must be accelerating toward the Moon.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "There is a net force because the force exerted by Earth is greater than that exerted by the Moon."
