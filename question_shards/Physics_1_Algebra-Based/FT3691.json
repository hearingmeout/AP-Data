    "question": "A person throws a marble straight up into the air, releasing it a short height above the ground and catching it at that same height. If air resistance is negligible, which of the following graphs of position y versus time t is correct for the motion of the marble as it goes up and then comes down?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Graph A shows a straight line with a positive slope for the first half of the time and a straight line starting from the same point withan equal but negative slope for the second half of the time.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Graph B shows a smooth, continuous curve that is increasing during the first half of the time and decreasing during the second half of the time, and is always concave down.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Graph C shows a curvethat is increasing during the first half of the time and decreasing during the second half of the time, and is always concave up, with a cusp where the increasing and decreasing parts of the curve meet.",

      {
        "label": "Graph D shows a curve that is concave down and increasing during the first half of the time and concave up and decreasing during the second half of the time, with a cusp where the increasing and decreasing parts of the curve meet.",
