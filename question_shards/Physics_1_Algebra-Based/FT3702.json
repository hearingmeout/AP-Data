    "question": "An object weighing 120 N is set on a rigid beam of negligible mass at a distance of 3 m from a pivot, as shown above. A vertical force is to be applied to the other end of the beam a distance of 4 m from the pivot to keep the beam at rest and horizontal. What is the magnitude F of the force required?",
