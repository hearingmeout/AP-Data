    "description": "A block of mass 3 kg slides along a horizontal surface that has negligible friction except for one section, as shown above. The block arrives at the rough section with a speed of 5 m/s and leaves it 0.5 s later with a speed of 3 m/s.",
    "question": "What is the magnitude of the average frictional force exerted on the block by the rough section of the surface?",
