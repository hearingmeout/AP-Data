    "description": "A sphere of mass m1, which is attached to a spring, is displaced downward from its equilibrium position as shown above left and released from rest. A sphere of mass m2, which is suspended from a string of length l is displaced to the right as shown above right and released from rest so that it swings as a simple pendulum with small amplitude. Assume that both spheres undergo simple harmonic motion",
    "question": "Which of the following is true for both spheres?",
