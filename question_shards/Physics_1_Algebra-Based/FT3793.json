    "question": "An empty sled of mass M moves without friction across a frozen pond at speed v0. Two objects are dropped vertically into the sled one at a time: first an object of mass m and then an object of mass 2m. Afterward the sled moves with speed vf. What would be the final speed of the sled if the objects were dropped into it in reverse order?",
