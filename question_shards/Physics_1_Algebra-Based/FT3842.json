    "question": "Two objects, A and B, initially at rest, are “exploded” apart by the release of a coiled spring that was compressed between them. As they move apart, the velocity of object A is 5 m/s and the velocity of object B is -2 m/s. The ratio of the mass of object A to the mass of object B, mA/mB, is",
