    "question": "A simple pendulum and a mass hanging on a spring both have a period of 1 s when set into small oscillatory motion on Earth. They are taken to Planet X, which has the same diameter as Earth but twice the mass. Which of the following statements is true about the periods of the two objects on Planet X compared to their periods on Earth?",
