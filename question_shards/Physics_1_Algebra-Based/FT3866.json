    "question": "Balls 1 and 2 are each thrown horizontally from the same height above level ground, but ball 2 has a greater initial velocity after leaving the thrower’s hand. If air resistance is negligible, how do the accelerations of the balls and the times it takes them to hit the ground compare?",
