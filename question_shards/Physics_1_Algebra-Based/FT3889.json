    "description": "An object of mass m is initially at rest and free to move without friction in any direction in the xy-plane. A constant net force of magnitude F directed in the +x direction acts on the object for 1 s. Immediately thereafter a constant net force of the same magnitude F directed in the +y direction acts on the object for 1 s. After this, no forces act on the object.",
    "question": "Which of the following vectors could represent the velocity of the object at the end of 3 s, assuming the scales on the x and y axes are equal?",
