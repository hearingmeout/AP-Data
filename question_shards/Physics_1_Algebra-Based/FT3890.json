    "description": "An object of mass m is initially at rest and free to move without friction in any direction in the xy-plane. A constant net force of magnitude F directed in the +x direction acts on the object for 1 s. Immediately thereafter a constant net force of the same magnitude F directed in the +y direction acts on the object for 1 s. After this, no forces act on the object.",
