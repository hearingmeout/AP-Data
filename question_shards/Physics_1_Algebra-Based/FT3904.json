    "question": "A bus is initially traveling north at a constant speed, as shown in the figure above. As the bus starts to make a left turn without changing speed, a passenger notices that a box on the floor starts sliding toward the right side of the bus. Which of the following top views of the box, when correctly labeled, would best represent all of the horizontal forces exerted on the box as it starts sliding?",
