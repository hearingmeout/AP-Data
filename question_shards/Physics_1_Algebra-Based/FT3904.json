    "question": "A bus is initially traveling north at a constant speed, as shown in the figure above. As the bus starts to make a left turn without changing speed, a passenger notices that a box on the floor starts sliding toward the right side of the bus. Which of the following top views of the box, when correctly labeled, would best represent all of the horizontal forces exerted on the box as it starts sliding?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Option A consists of a square box and a directional arrow. The figure shows a box with an arrow to the right of it pointing right.",

        "label": "Option D consists of a square box and a directional arrow. The figure shows a box with a horizontal arrow to the left of it pointing left, and a horizontal arrow to the right of it pointing right. The arrow pointing left appears to be about half the length of the arrow pointing right.",
