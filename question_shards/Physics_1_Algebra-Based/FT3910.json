    "question": "A ball is dropped from rest and falls to the floor. The initial gravitational potential energy of the ball-Earth-floor system is 10 J. The ball then bounces back up to a height where the gravitational potential energy is 7 J. What was the mechanical energy of the ball-Earth-floor system the instant the ball left the floor?",
