    "question": "A disk is initially rotating counterclockwise around a fixed axis with angular speed w0.\n\nAt time t = 0, the two forces shown in the figure above are exerted on the disk. If counterclockwise is positive, which of the following could show the angular velocity of the disk as a function of time?",
