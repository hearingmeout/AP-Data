    "question": "A thin rod of length d on a frictionless surface is pivoted about one end, as shown above, and can rotate freely. The rod is at rest when it is struck by a sphere with linear momentum of magnitude pi perpendicular to the rod. The sphere rebounds along its original line of motion with momentum of magnitude pf. What is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the rod immediately after the collision?",
