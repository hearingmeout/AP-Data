    "question": "Two carts, of mass 2m and m, approach each other head-on with the same speed v, as shown in the figure above. When the carts collide, they hook together. Assuming positive momentum is to the right, which of the following best represents the momentum of the cart of mass m as a function of time before and after the collision?",
