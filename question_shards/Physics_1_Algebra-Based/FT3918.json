    "question": "A student stands at one end of a raft floating in a pool with equally spaced marks along the bottom, as shown above. The student and the raft have the same mass. The student walks to the opposite end of the raft. Which of the following best shows the final locations of the raft and student relative to the marks at the bottom of the pool? Assume that there is no drag force between the raft and the water.",
