    "question": "A lion is running at constant speed toward a gazelle that is standing still, as shown in the top figure above. After several seconds, the gazelle notices the lion and accelerates directly toward him, hoping to pass the lion and force him to reverse direction. As the gazelle accelerates toward and past the lion, the lion changes direction and accelerates in pursuit of the gazelle. The lion and the gazelle eventually each reach constant but different speeds. Which of the following sets of graphs shows a reasonable representation of the velocities of the lion and the gazelle as functions of time?",

Each graph has a horizontal axis labeled Time, a vertical axis labeled Velocity, and the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled 0.

It starts as a straight horizontal line to the right Then about a fourth of the way along the horizontal axis it becomes a straight line up and to the right, to about halfway above the horizontal axis, where it then becomes a straight horizontal line to the right again. The graph titled Gazelle begins at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes. It starts as a straight horizontal line along the horizontal axis. Then about a fourth of the way along the horizontal axis it becomes a straight line up and to the right, to about three quarters of the way above the horizontal axis, where it then becomes a straight horizontal line to the right.",
