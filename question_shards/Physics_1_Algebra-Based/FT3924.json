    "question": "A spacecraft of mass 4000 kg is traveling in a straight line in the positive direction. Engines can be fired so that the force exerted on the spacecraft is in the positive or negative direction. The graph above shows data for the force during one interval. Which of the following is the best estimate of the net change in the speed of the spacecraft from time t = 0 to time t = 4 s?",
