    "question": "A rocket is continuously firing its engines as it accelerates away from Earth. For the first kilometer of its ascent, the mass of fuel ejected is small compared to the mass of the rocket. For this distance, which of the following indicates the changes, if any, in the kinetic energy of the rocket, the gravitational potential energy of the Earth-rocket system, and the mechanical energy of the Earth-rocket system?",
