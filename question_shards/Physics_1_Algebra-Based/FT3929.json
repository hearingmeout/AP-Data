    "question": "A child slides from rest down slides A and B shown above. The slides are the same height, and the coefficient of friction between the slides and the child is the same. Which of the following compares the change ∆K in the kinetic energy of the child and the change ∆U in the potential energy of the child-Earth system for the two slides?",
