    "description": "Refer to the following material to answer the group of questions.\nA student is observing an object of unknown mass that is oscillating horizontally at the end of an ideal spring. The student measures the object’s period of oscillation with a stopwatch.",
    "question": "While the object is continuously oscillating, the student determines the maximum speed of the object during two oscillations. The first speed is 3.5 m / s and the second speed is 2.7 m / s. Which of the following could account for the decrease in the object’s maximum kinetic energy?",
