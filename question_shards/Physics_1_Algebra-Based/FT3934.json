    "question": "While the object is continuously oscillating, the student determines the maximum speed of the object during two oscillations. The first speed is 3.5 m / s and the second speed is 2.7 m / s. Which of the following could account for the decrease in the object’s maximum kinetic energy?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Energy was transferred from the object to the spring, which increased the maximum potential energy of the spring.",

      {
        "label": "As energy was transferred back and forth between the object and the spring, a greater average share of the energy became potential energy of the spring.",
