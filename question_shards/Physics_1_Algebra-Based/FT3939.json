    "description": "Refer to the following material for answering group of questions.\n\nA crate is on a horizontal frictionless surface. A force of magnitude F is exerted on the crate at an angle θ to the horizontal, as shown in the figure above, causing the crate to slide to the right. The surface exerts a normal force of magnitude FN on the crate. As the crate slides a distance d, it gains an amount of kinetic energy ∆K. While F is kept constant, the angle θ is now doubled but is still less than 90o. Assume the crate remains in contact with the surface.",
    "question": "As the crate slides a distance d, how does the new gain in kinetic energy compare to ∆K?",
