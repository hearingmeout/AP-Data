    "question": "A block on a level surface is attached to one end of a spring, as shown in the figure above. The other end of the spring is attached to a wall. There is friction between the block and the surface. A person displaces the block from its equilibrium position and releases it. Which of the following shows the mechanical energy E as a function of time t for the system that includes only the block and the system that includes the block and spring?",

        "label": "Each option consists of two graphs in the first quadrant. The graph on the left has a horizontal axis labeled t and a vertical axis labeled E sub Block, and the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled 0. The graph on the right has a horizontal axis labeled t and a vertical axis labeled E sub Block and Spring, and the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled 0.  Option A. The left graph has a pattern of four similar sections. Each section starts at the horizontal axis, rises to a maximum value, is concave down and returns to the horizontal axis. The maximum height of each section decreases as the values for time increase. The first section of the right graph starts almost at the top of the vertical axis and drops steeply to the horizontal axis. The next four sections follow a pattern. Each section starts at the horizontal axis, rises to a maximum value that is less than the starting height of the first section, is concave down and returns to the horizontal axis. The height of each section decreases as the values for time increase. The last section of the graph is cut off at its maximum value.",
