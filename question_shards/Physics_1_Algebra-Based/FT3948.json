    "question": "Two identical carts are free to move along a straight frictionless track. At time t1, cart X is moving at 2.0 m/s when it collides with and sticks to cart Y, which is initially at rest. Which of the following graphs best shows the velocity of cart X before and after the collision?",

        "label": "Each option consists of a graph in the first quadrant. The horizontal axis is labeled Time, in units of seconds, and the vertical axis is labeled Velocity, in units of meters per second. The intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled 0. There is one tick mark halfway along the horizontal axis labeled t sub 1, and the numbers appearing on the vertical axis, from bottom to top, are 1 and 2.  Option A. The figure shows a graph of a straight horizontal line that begins on the vertical axis at 2 meters per second.",
