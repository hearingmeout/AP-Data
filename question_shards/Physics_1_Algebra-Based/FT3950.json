    "question": "A spaceship and its shuttle pod are traveling to the right in a straight line with speed v, as shown in the top figure above. The mass of the pod is m, and the mass of the spaceship is 6m. The pod is launched, and afterward the pod is moving to the right with speed vp and the spaceship is moving to the right with speed where vf > v, as shown in the bottom figure. Which of the following is true of the speed vc of the center of mass of the system after the pod is launched?",
