    "question": "A train is traveling east with constant speed vt. Two identical spheres are rolling on the floor of one train car. In the frame of reference of the train, the spheres are moving directly toward each other at one instant with the same speed vp parallel to the train’s motion, as shown in the figure above. What is the velocity of the center of mass of the spheres in the frame of reference of the train and in the frame of reference of a person standing at rest alongside the train?",
