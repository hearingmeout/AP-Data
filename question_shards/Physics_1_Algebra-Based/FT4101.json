    "question": "A satellite that is a spinning cylinder has initial rotational inertia I­0 and angular velocity w0. Solar panels unfold from the satellite and are extended outward. The satellite then has rotational inertia If = aI0 and angular velocity wf = bw0, where a and b are constants. Which of the following is true about the constants a and b?",
