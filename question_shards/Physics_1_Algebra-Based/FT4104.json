    "question": "A person holds a 4.0 kg block at position A shown above on the left, in contact with an uncompressed vertical spring with a spring constant of 500 N/m. The person gently lowers the block from rest at position A to rest at position B. Which of the following describes the change in the energy of the block-spring-Earth system as a result of the block being lowered?",
