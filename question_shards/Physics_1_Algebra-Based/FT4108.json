    "description": "Refer to the following material to answer the questions.\n\nThe stacks of boxes shown in the figure above are inside an elevator that is moving upward. The masses of the boxes are given in terms of the mass M of the lightest box.",
    "question": "Assume the elevator is moving at constant speed, and consider the bottom box in the stack that has two boxes of mass 2M. Let Ffloor be the force exerted by the floor on the box, Fg be the force exerted by gravity on the box, and Fbox be the force exerted by the top box on the bottom box. Which of the following best represents the forces exerted on the bottom box?",
