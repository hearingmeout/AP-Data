    "question": "The diagram above shows a top view of a child of mass M on a circular platform of mass 2M that is rotating counterclockwise. Assume the platform rotates without friction. Which of the following describes an action by the child that will increase the angular speed of the platform-child system and gives the correct reason why?",
