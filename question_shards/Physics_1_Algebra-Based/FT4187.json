    "question": "Block A hangs from a light string that passes over a light pulley and is attached to block B, which is on a level horizontal frictionless table, as shown above. Students are to determine the mass of block B from the motion of the two-block system after it is released from rest. They plan to measure the time block A takes to reach the floor. The students must also take which of the following measurements to determine the mass of block B?",
