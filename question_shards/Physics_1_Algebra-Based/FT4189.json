    "question": "Two blocks, of mass m and 2m, are initially at rest on a horizontal frictionless surface. A force F is exerted individually on each block, as shown above. The graph shows how F varies with time t. Which block has the greatest average power provided to it between t = 0 s and t = 3 s?",
