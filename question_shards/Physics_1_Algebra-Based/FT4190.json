    "question": "A moon is in an elliptical orbit about a planet as shown above. At point A the moon has speed μA and is at distance RA from the planet. At point B the moon has speed μB. Which of the following explains a correct method for determining the distance of the moon from the planet at point B in terms of the given quantities?",
