    "description": "Refer to the following material for answering the questions.\n\nBlock 1 of mass m1 and block 2 of mass m2 are sliding along the same line on a horizontal frictionless surface when they collide at time tc. The graph above shows the velocities of the blocks as a function of time.",
    "question": "How does the kinetic energy of the two-block system after the collision compare with its kinetic energy before the collision, and why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "It is less, because the blocks have the same velocity after the collision, so some of their kinetic energy was transformed into internal energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is less, because the blocks have velocities in opposite directions before the collision, so some of their kinetic energy cancels.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is the same, because the collision was instantaneous, so the effect of external forces during the collision is negligible.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is the same, because the blocks have the same velocity after the collision, and there is no friction acting on them.",
