    "question": "Which of the following is true of the motion of the center of mass of the two-block system during the time shown?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The center of mass does not move because the blocks are moving in opposite directions before the collision.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The center of mass moves at a constant velocity of +1.0 m/s because there is no friction acting on the system.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The center-of-mass velocity starts out greater than +1.0 m/s but decreases to +1.0 m/s during the collision because the collision is inelastic.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The center-of-mass velocity increases as the blocks get closer together, and then becomes constant after the collision.",

      }
