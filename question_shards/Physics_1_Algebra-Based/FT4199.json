    "description": "Refer to the following material for answering the questions.\n\nA cart is constrained to move along a straight line. A varying net force along the direction of motion is exerted on the cart. The cart’s velocity v as a function of time t is shown in the graph above. The five labeled points divide the graph into four sections.",
    "question": "Which of the following correctly ranks the magnitude of the average acceleration of the cart during the four sections of the graph?",
