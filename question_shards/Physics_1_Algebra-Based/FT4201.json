    "description": "Refer to the following material for answering the questions.\n\nA cart is constrained to move along a straight line. A varying net force along the direction of motion is exerted on the cart. The cart’s velocity v as a function of time t is shown in the graph above. The five labeled points divide the graph into four sections.",
    "question": "During some part of the motion, the work done on the cart is negative. What feature of the motion indicates this?",
