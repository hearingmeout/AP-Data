    "question": "A block of mass 2 kg slides along a horizontal tabletop. A horizontal applied force of 12 N and a vertical applied force of 15 N act on the block, as shown above. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the table is 0.2, the frictional force exerted on the block is most nearly",
