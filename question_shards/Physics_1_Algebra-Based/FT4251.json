    "question": "A massless rigid rod of length 3d is pivoted at a fixed point W, and\n two forces each of magnitude F are applied vertically upward as\n shown above. A third vertical force of magnitude F may be applied,\n either upward or downward, at one of the labeled points. With the\n proper choice of direction at each point, the rod can be in equilibrium\n if the third force of magnitude F is applied at point",
