    "question": "A person driving a car suddenly applies the brakes. The car takes 4 s to come to rest while traveling 20 m at constant acceleration. Can the speed of the car immediately before the brakes were applied be determined without first determining the car’s acceleration?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, by dividing the distance (20 m) by the time (4 s).",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, by determining the average speed while braking and doubling it.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the acceleration is needed to use standard equations such as Δx = vot + 1/2 at2.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the fundamental relationship that defines velocity contains acceleration.",

    "answer": "Yes, by determining the average speed while braking and doubling it."
