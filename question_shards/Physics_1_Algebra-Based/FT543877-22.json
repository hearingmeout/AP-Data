    "question": "The experimental apparatus shown in the figure above contains a pendulum consisting of a 0.66 kg ball attached to a string of length 0.60 m. The pendulum is released from rest at an angle of 60 degrees and collides with a ball of mass 0.22 kg initially at rest at the edge of a table. The 0.22 kg ball hits the floor a distance of 1.4 m from the edge of the table.\n\nCalculate the speed of the 0.66 kg ball just before the collision.\n\nCalculate the speed of the 0.22 kg ball immediately after the collision.\n\nCalculate the speed of the 0.66 kg ball immediately after the collision.\n\nIndicate the direction of motion of the 0.66 kg ball immediately after the collision.\n\n____ To the left ____ To the right\n\nCalculate the height to which the 0.66 kg ball rises after the collision.\n\nBased on your data, is the collision elastic?\n\n____ Yes ____ No\n\nJustify your answer.",
