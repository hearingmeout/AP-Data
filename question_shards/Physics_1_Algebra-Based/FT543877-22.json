    "question": "The experimental apparatus shown in the figure above contains a pendulum consisting of a 0.66 kg ball attached to a string of length 0.60 m. The pendulum is released from rest at an angle of 60 degrees and collides with a ball of mass 0.22 kg initially at rest at the edge of a table. The 0.22 kg ball hits the floor a distance of 1.4 m from the edge of the table. Calculate the speed of the 0.66 kg ball just before the collision. Calculate the speed of the 0.22 kg ball immediately after the collision. Calculate the speed of the 0.66 kg ball immediately after the collision. Indicate the direction of motion of the 0.66 kg ball immediately after the collision. ____ To the left ____ To the right Calculate the height to which the 0.66 kg ball rises after the collision. Based on your data, is the collision elastic? ____ Yes ____ No Justify your answer.",
