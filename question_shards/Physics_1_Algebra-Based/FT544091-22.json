    "question": "The figure above represents a racetrack with semicircular sections connected by straight sections. Each section has length d, and markers along the track are spaced d/4 apart. Two people drive cars counterclockwise around the track, as shown. Car X goes around the curves at constant speed vc, increases speed at constant acceleration for half of each straight section to reach a maximum speed of 2vc , then brakes at constant acceleration for the other half of each straight section to return to speed vc. Car Y also goes around the curves at constant speed vc, increases speed at constant acceleration for one-fourth of each straight section to reach the same maximum speed 2vc, stays at that speed for half of each straight section, then brakes at constant acceleration for the remaining fourth of each straight section to return to speed vc.\n\n(a) On the figures below, draw an arrow showing the direction of the net force on each of the cars at the positions noted by the dots. If the net force is zero at any position, label the dot with 0.\n\n(b)\n\nIndicate which car, if either, completes one trip around the track in less time, and justify your answer quantitatively without using equations.\n\nJustify your answer about which car, if either, completes one trip around the track in less time quantitatively with appropriate equations.\n\n(c) Explain how your equations in part (b) ii reexpress your reasoning in part (b) i. Do not simply refer to any final results of your calculations, but instead indicate how terms in your equations correspond to concepts in your qualitative explanation.",
