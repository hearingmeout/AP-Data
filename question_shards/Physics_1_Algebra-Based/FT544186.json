    "question": "The figure above represents two carts, with magnets attached, that make up a system. The mass of one cart and magnet is 1 kg and the mass of the other is 5 kg. The carts are initially at rest on a frictionless track. They are released from rest and exert a repulsive force on each other. The track is not quite horizontal, with the right side slightly lower than the left side. \nThe speeds of the carts are measured over a 10 s interval. The graph below shows the momentum of the two carts as a function of time for this interval as they move along the x-axis.\n\nBased on the graph, were the measurements started at the instant the carts were released? \nJustify your answer. \n\nCalculate the magnitude of the external force exerted on the system.\n\nSuppose the experiment is repeated with different carts, so that the masses of cart plus magnet are 2 kg and 4 kg. Would your answer to part (b) be different with the new masses? \nJustify your answer.",
