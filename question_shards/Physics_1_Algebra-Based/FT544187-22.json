    "question": "A student hangs a 0.125 kg object on a spring, sets it into oscillation, and obtains the data for the position and velocity of the object as a function of time shown in the graphs below.\n\n(a) On the grid below, sketch the potential energy of the object-spring-Earth system as a function of time. Explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values, as appropriate.\n\n(b) On the axes below, sketch the acceleration of the object as a function of time. Explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values, as appropriate.\n\nNext the student is given a rubber band and asked to determine whether the relationship between the restoring force exerted by the rubber band and the amount it is stretched is the same as that of an ideal spring.\n\n(c) Describe an experimental procedure that the student could use to collect the necessary data, including all the equipment the student would need.\n\n(d) How should the student analyze the data to determine whether the relationship between the restoring force exerted by the rubber band and the amount it is stretched is the same as that of an ideal spring? What evidence from the analysis would be used to make the determination?",
