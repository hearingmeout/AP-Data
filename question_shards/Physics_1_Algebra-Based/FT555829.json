    "question": "Two blocks are connected by a string of negligible mass that passes over massless pulleys that turn with negligible friction, as shown in the figure above. The mass m2 of block 2 is greater than the mass m1 of block 1.The blocks are released from rest.\n(a) The dots below represent the two blocks. Draw free-body diagrams showing and labeling the forces(not components) exerted on each block. Draw the relative lengths of all vectors to reflect the relative magnitudes of all the forces.\n\n(b) Derive the magnitude of the acceleration of block 2. Express your answer in terms of m1, m2, and g.\nBlock 3 of mass m3 is added to the system, as shown below. There is no friction between block 3 and the table.\n\n(c) Indicate whether the magnitude of the acceleration of block 2 is now larger, smaller, or the same as in the original two-block system. Explain how you arrived at your answer.",
