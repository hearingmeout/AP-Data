    "question": "A 0.40 kg object moves in a straight line under the action of a net force. The graph above shows the velocity as a function of time for the object during a 25 s interval. At time t = 0, the object is at the position x = 0. (a) On the grid below, sketch a graph of the acceleration as a function of time for the object. Label the scale for the acceleration.(b) Calculate the position of the object at t = 5.0 s.(c) On which segment of the graph is the net force acting on the object zero? ____ A ____ B ____ CJustify your answer. (d) Calculate the net force on the object during the first 3.0 s of the motion. (e) Calculate the amount of work done on the object by the net force during the first 15 s of the motion. (f) For the interval t = 15 s to t = 25 s, is the work done on the object by the net force positive, negative, or zero? ____ Positive ____ Negative ____ Zero Justify your answer.",
