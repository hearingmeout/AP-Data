    "question": "A small block of mass 0.15 kg is placed at point A at a height 2.0 m above the bottom of a track, as shown in the figure above, and is released from rest. It slides with negligible friction down the track, around the inside of the loop of radius 0.60 m, and leaves the track at point C at a height 0.50 m above the bottom of the track. (a) Calculate the speed of the block when it leaves the track at point C. (b) On the figure below, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the block when it is at the top of the loop at point B. (c) Calculate the minimum speed the block can have at point B without losing contact with the track. (d) Calculate the minimum height hmin above the bottom of the track at which the block can be released and still go around the loop without losing contact with the track.",
