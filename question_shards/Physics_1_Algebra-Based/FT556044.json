    "question": "A small block of mass M is released from rest at the top of the curved frictionless ramp shown above. The block slides down the ramp and is moving with a speed 3.5v0 when it collides with a larger block of mass 1.5M at rest at the bottom of the incline. The larger block moves to the right at a speed 2v0 immediately after the collision. Express your answers to the following questions in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants. (a) Determine the height h of the ramp from which the small block was released. (b) Determine the speed of the small block after the collision. (c) The larger block slides a distance D before coming to rest.
