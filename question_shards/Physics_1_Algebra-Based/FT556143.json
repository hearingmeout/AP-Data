The graph of velocity vx versus time t for the cart is given below.\n\nIndicate every time t for which the cart is at rest.\n\nIndicate every time interval for which the speed (magnitude of velocity) of the cart is increasing.\n\nDetermine the horizontal position x of the cart at t = 9.0 s if the cart is located at x = 2.0 m at t = 0. \n\nOn the axes below, sketch the acceleration a versus time t graph for the motion of the cart from t = 0 to t = 25 s.\n\nFrom t = 25 s until the cart reaches the end of the track, the cart continues with constant horizontal velocity. The cart leaves the end of the track and hits the floor, which is 0.40 m below the track. Neglecting air resistance, determine each of the following. \n\nThe time from when the cart leaves the track until it first hits the floor\n\nThe horizontal distance from the end of the track to the point at which the cart first hits the floor \n\nThe kinetic energy of the cart immediately before it hits the floor",
