    "question": "Blocks 1 and 2 of masses m1 and m2, respectively, are connected by a light string, as shown above. These blocks are further connected to a block of mass M by another light string that passes over a pulley of negligible mass and friction. Blocks 1 and 2 move with a constant velocity v down the inclined plane, which makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The kinetic frictional force on block 1 is f and that on block 2 is 2f.On the figure below, draw and label all the forces on block m1.Express your answers to each of the following in terms of m1, m2, g, θ, and f.Determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between the inclined plane and block 1.Determine the value of the suspended mass M that allows blocks 1 and 2 to move with constant velocity down the plane.The string between blocks 1 and 2 is now cut. Determine the acceleration of block 1 while it is on the inclined plane",
