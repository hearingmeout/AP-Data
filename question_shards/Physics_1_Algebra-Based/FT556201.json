    "question": "An incident ball A of mass 0.10 kg is sliding at 1.4 m/s on the horizontal tabletop of negligible friction shown above. It makes a head-on collision with a target ball B of mass 0.50 kg at rest at the edge of the table. As a result of the collision, the incident ball rebounds, sliding backwards at 0.70 m/s immediately after the collision.Calculate the speed of the 0.50 kg target ball immediately after the collision. The tabletop is 1.20 m above a level, horizontal floor. The target ball is projected horizontally and initially strikes the floor at a horizontal displacement d from the point of collision. Calculate the horizontal displacement d. In another experiment on the same table, the target ball B is replaced by target ball C of mass 0.10 kg. The incident ball A again slides at 1.4 m/s, as shown above left, but this time makes a glancing collision with the target ball C that is at rest at the edge of the table. The target ball C strikes the floor at point P, which is at a horizontal displacement of 0.15 m from the point of the collision, and at a horizontal angle of 30° from the +x-axis, as shown above right.Calculate the speed v of the target ball C immediately after the collision.Calculate the y-component of incident ball A’s momentum immediately after the collision.",
