    "question": "A ball attached to a string of length l swings in a horizontal circle, as shown above, with a constant speed. The string makes an angle θ with the vertical, and T is the magnitude of the tension in the string. Express your answers to the following in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants.\n\nOn the figure below, draw and label vectors to represent all the forces acting on the ball when it is at the position shown in the diagram. The lengths of the vectors should be consistent with the relative magnitudes of the forces.\n\nDetermine the mass of the ball.\n\nDetermine the speed of the ball.\n\nDetermine the frequency of revolution of the ball.\n\nSuppose that the string breaks as the ball swings in its circular path. Qualitatively describe the trajectory of the ball after the string breaks but before it hits the ground.",
