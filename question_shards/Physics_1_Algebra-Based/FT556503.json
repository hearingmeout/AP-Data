    "question": "The vertical position of an elevator as a function of time is shown above.On the grid below, graph the velocity of the elevator as a function of time. Calculate the average acceleration for the time period t = 8 s to t = 10 s.On the box below that represents the elevator, draw a vector to represent the direction of this average acceleration. Suppose that there is a passenger of mass 70 kg in the elevator. Calculate the apparent weight of the passenger at time t = 4 s.",
