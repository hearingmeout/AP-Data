    "question": "The vertical position of an elevator as a function of time is shown above.\n\nOn the grid below, graph the velocity of the elevator as a function of time. \n\nCalculate the average acceleration for the time period t = 8 s to t = 10 s.\n\nOn the box below that represents the elevator, draw a vector to represent the direction of this average acceleration. \n\nSuppose that there is a passenger of mass 70 kg in the elevator. Calculate the apparent weight of the passenger at time t = 4 s.",
