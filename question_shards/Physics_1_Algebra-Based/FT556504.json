The pendulum is held at an angle of 30° from the vertical by a light horizontal string attached to a wall, as shown above.\n\nOn the figure below, draw a free-body diagram showing and labeling the forces on the bob in the position shown above. \n\nCalculate the tension in the horizontal string.\n\nThe horizontal string is now cut close to the bob, and the pendulum swings down. Calculate the speed of the bob at its lowest position",
