    "question": "A student of mass m stands on a platform scale in an elevator in a tall building. The positive direction for all vector quantities is upward.Draw a free-body diagram showing and labeling all the forces acting on the student, who is represented by the dot below. Derive an expression for the reading on the scale in terms of the acceleration a of the elevator, the mass m of the student, and fundamental constants. An inspector provides the student with the following graph showing the acceleration a of the elevator as a function of time t. During what time interval(s) is the force exerted by the platform scale on the student a maximum value? Calculate the magnitude of that maximum force for a 45 kg student. During what time interval(s) is the speed of the elevator constant?",
