    "question": "A simple pendulum consists of a bob of mass 0.085 kg attached to a string of length 1.5 m. The pendulum is raised to point Q, which is 0.08 m above its lowest position, and released so that it oscillates with small amplitude θ between the points P and Q as shown below. On the figures below, draw free-body diagrams showing and labeling the forces acting on the bob in each of the situations described. Calculate the speed u of the bob at its lowest position. Calculate the tension in the string when the bob is passing through its lowest position. Describe one modification that could be made to double the period of oscillation.",
