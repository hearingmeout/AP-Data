    "question": "A rope of negligible mass passes over a pulley of negligible mass attached to the ceiling, as shown above. One end of the rope is held by Student A of mass 70 kg, who is at rest on the floor. The opposite end of the rope is held by Student B of mass 60 kg, who is suspended at rest above the floor. On the dots below that represent the students, draw and label free-body diagrams showing the forces on Student A and on Student B.Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted by the floor on Student A. Student B now climbs up the rope at a constant acceleration of 0.25 m/s2 with respect to the floor.Calculate the tension in the rope while Student B is accelerating.As Student B is accelerating, is Student A pulled upward off the floor? Justify your answer.With what minimum acceleration must Student B climb up the rope to lift Student A upward off the floor?",
