    "question": "A student whose normal weight is 500 newtons stands on a scale in an elevator and records the scale reading as a function of time. The data are shown in the graph above. At time t = 0, the elevator is at displacement x = 0 with velocity v = 0. Assume that the positive directions for displacement, velocity, and acceleration are upward. (a) On the diagram to the right,draw and label of the forces on the student at t = 8 seconds. (b) Calculate the acceleration a of the elevator for each 5-second interval. Indicate your results by completing the following table. Time interval(s) 0-5 5-10 10-15 15-20 a(m/s2) ____ ____ ____ ____ Plot the acceleration as a function of time on the following graph (c) Determine the velocity v of the elevator at the end of each 5-second interval. Indicate your results by completing the following table Time interval(s) 5 10 15 20 v(m/s) ____ ____ ____ ____ Plot the velocity as a function of time on the following graph. (d) Determine the displacement x of the elevator above the starting point at the end of each 5-second interval. Indicate your results by completing the following table Time interval(s) 5 10 15 20 x(m) ____ ____ ____ ____ Plot the displacement as a function of time on the following graph.",
