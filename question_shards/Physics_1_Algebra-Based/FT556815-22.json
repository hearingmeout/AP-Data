    "question": "A ball of mass 0.5 kilogram, initially at rest, is kicked directly toward a fence from a point 32 meters away, as shown above. The velocity of the ball as it leaves the kicker's foot is 20 meters per second at a angle of 37o above the horizontal. The top of the fence is 2.5 meters high. The kicker's foot is in contact with the ball for 0.05 second. The ball hits nothing while in flight and air resistance is negligible. (a) Determine the magnitude of the average net force exerted on the ball during the kick. (b) Determine the time it takes for the ball to reach the plane of the fence. (c) Will the ball hit the fence? If so, how far below the top of the fence will it hit? If not, how far above the top of the fence will it pass? (d) On the axes below, sketch the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity of the ball as functions of time until the ball reaches the plane of the fence.",
