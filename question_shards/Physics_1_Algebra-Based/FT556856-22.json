    "question": "As shown above, a 0.20-kilogram mass is sliding on a horizontal friction less air track with a speed of 3.0 meters per second when it instantaneously hits and sticks to a 1.3-kilogram mass initially at rest on the track. The 1.3-kilogram mass is connected to one end of a mass less spring, which has a spring constant of 100 newtons per meter. The other end of the spring is fixed.\n\n(a) Determine the following for the 0.20-kilogram mass immediately before the impact.\n\nIts linear momentum\n\nIts kinetic energy\n\n(b) Determine the following for the combined masses immediately after the impact\n\nThe linear momentum\n\nThe kinetic energy\n\nAfter the collision, the two masses undergo simple harmonic motion about their position at impact.\n\n(c) Determine the amplitude of the harmonic motion.\n\n(d) Determine the period of the harmonic motion.",
