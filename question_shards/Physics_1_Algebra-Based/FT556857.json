    "question": "Part of the track of an amusement park roller coaster is shaped as shown above. A safety bar is oriented length-wise along the top of each car. In one roller coaster car, a small 0.10-kilogram ball is suspended from this bar by a short length of light, inextensible string. (a) Initially, the car is at rest a point A. On the diagram to the right, draw and label all the forces acting on the 0.10-kilogram ball. Calculate the tension in the string. The car is then accelerated horizontally, goes up a 30o incline, goes down a 30o incline, and then goes around a vertical circular loop of radius 25 meters. For each of the four situations described in parts (b) to (e), do all three of the following. In each situation, assume that the ball has stopped swinging back and forth. • Determine the horizontal component Th of the tension in the string in newtons and record your answer in the space provided. • Determine the vertical component Tv of the tension in the string in newtons and record your answer in the space provided. • Show on the adjacent diagram the approximate direction of the string with respect to the vertical. The dashed line shows the vertical in each situation. (b) The car is at point B moving horizontally to the right with an acceleration of 5.0 m/s2. Th =________N Tv =________N (c) The car is at point C and is being pulled up the 30o incline with a constant speed of 30 m/s Th =________N Tv =________N (d) The car is at point D moving down the 30o incline with an acceleration of 5.0 m/s2. Th =________N Tv =________N (e) The car is at point E moving upside down with an instantaneous speed of 25 m/s and no tangential acceleration at the top of the vertical loop of radius 25 meters. Th =________N Tv =________N",
