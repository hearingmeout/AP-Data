    "question": "Several students are riding in bumper cars at an amusement park. The combined mass of car A and its occupants is 250 kg. The combined mass of car B and its occupants is 200 kg. Car A is 15 m away from car B and moving to the right at 2.0 m/s, as shown, when the driver decides to bump into car B, which is at rest.\n\n(a) Car A accelerates at 1.5 m/s2 to a speed of 5.0 m/s and then continues at constant velocity until it strikes car B. Calculate the total time for car A to travel the 15 m.\n\n(b) After the collision, car B moves to the right at a speed of 4.8 m/s .\n\ni. Calculate the speed of car A after the collision.\n\nii. Indicate the direction of motion of car A after the collision.\n\n____ To the left ____ To the right ____ None; car A is at rest.\n\n(c) Is this an elastic collision?\n\n____ Yes ____ No\n\nJustify your answer.",
