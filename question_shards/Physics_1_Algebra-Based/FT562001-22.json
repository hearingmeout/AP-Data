    "question": "A long track, inclined at an angle θ to the horizontal, has small speed bumps on it. The bumps are evenly spaced a distance d apart, as shown in the figure above. The track is actually much longer than shown, with over 100 bumps. A cart of mass M is released from rest at the top of the track. A student notices that after reaching the 40th bump the cart’s average speed between successive bumps no longer increases, reaching a maximum value vavg. This means the time interval taken to move from one bump to the next bump becomes constant.\n\nConsider the cart’s motion between bump 41 and bump 44.\n\nIn the figure below, sketch a graph of the cart’s velocity v as a function of time from the moment it reaches bump 41 until the moment it reaches bump 44.\n\nOver the same time interval, draw a dashed horizontal line at v = vavg. Label the line\"vavg\"\n\nSuppose the distance between the bumps is increased but everything else stays the same. Is the maximum speed of the cart now greater than, less than, or the same as it was with the bumps closer together?\n\n____Greater than ____Less than ____The same as\n\nBriefly explain your reasoning.\n\nWith the bumps returned to the original spacing, the track is tilted to a greater ramp angle θ. Is the maximum speed of the cart greater than, less than, or the same as it was when the ramp angle was smaller?\n\n____Greater than ____Less than ____The same as\n\nBriefly explain your reasoning.\n\nBefore deriving an equation for a quantity such as vavg , it can be useful to come up with an equation that is intuitively expected to be true.
