    "question": "The left end of a rod of length d and rotational inertia I is attached to a frictionless horizontal surface by a frictionless pivot, as shown above. Point C marks the center (midpoint) of the rod. The rod is initially motionless but is free to rotate around the pivot. A student will slide a disk of mass mdisk toward the rod with velocity v0 perpendicular to the rod, and the disk will stick to the rod a distance x from the pivot. The student wants the roddisk system to end up with as much angular speed as possible. Suppose the rod is much more massive than the disk. To give the rod as much angular speed as possible, should the student make the disk hit the rod to the left of point C, at point C, or to the right of point C ? _____To the left of C _____ At C _____ To the right of C Briefly explain your reasoning without manipulating equations.
