    "question": "A kitten sits in a lightweight basket near the edge of a table. A person accidentally knocks the basket off the table. As the kitten and basket fall, the kitten rolls, turns, kicks, and catches the basket in its claws. The basket lands on the floor with the kitten safely inside. If air resistance is negligible, what is the acceleration of the kitten-basket system while the kitten and basket are in midair?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The acceleration is directed downward with magnitude less than g because the basket is light.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The acceleration is directed downward with magnitude equal to g because the system is a projectile.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The acceleration fluctuates because of the rolling, turning, and kicking motion of the kitten.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The acceleration cannot be determined without knowing how hard the basket is pushed.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The acceleration is directed downward with magnitude equal to g because the system is a projectile."
