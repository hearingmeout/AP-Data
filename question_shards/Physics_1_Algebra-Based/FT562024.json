    "question": "A solid metal bar is at rest on a horizontal frictionless surface. It is free to rotate about a vertical axis at the left end. The figures below show forces of different magnitudes that are exerted on the bar at different locations. In which case does the bar’s angular speed about the axis increase at the fastest rate?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There is one arrow, labeled F. The arrow is below the bar, pointing straightup, and is touching the bar at the right end of the bar.",

      {
        "label": "There is one arrow, labeled 2 F. The arrow is below the bar, pointing straight up, and is touching the bar at a distance of one fourth of the length of the bar from the left end of the bar.",

      {
        "label": "There are 2 arrows, each labeled F over 2. Both arrows are below the bar and are pointing straight up. One arrow is touching the bar at the right end of the bar, and the other arrow is touching the bar at a distance of three fourths of the length of the bar from the left end of the bar.",

This arrow is touching the bar at a distance of one half of the length of the bar from the left end of the bar. The second arrow is labeled F over 2 and is below the bar and is pointing straight up. This arrow is touching the bar at the right end of the bar.",
