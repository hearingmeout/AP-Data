    "question": "Mars moves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the mass of Mars is much less than the mass of the Sun. At the instant shown above, Mars is getting farther away from the Sun. How does this affect the potential energy of the Mars-Sun system and the magnitude of Mars’s angular momentum with respect to the Sun?",
