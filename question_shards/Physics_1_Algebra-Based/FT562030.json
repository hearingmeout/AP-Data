    "description": "The graph above shows velocity v as a function of time t for a 0.50 kg object traveling along a straight line. The graph has three segments labeled 1, 2, and 3. A rope exerts a constant force of magnitude FT on the object along its direction of motion the whole time. During segment 2 only, a frictional force of magnitude Ff is also exerted on the object.",
    "question": "Which of the following correctly ranks the displacement ∆x for the three segments of the object’s motion?",
