    "description": "The graph above shows velocity v as a function of time t for a 0.50 kg object traveling along a straight line. The graph has three segments labeled 1, 2, and 3. A rope exerts a constant force of magnitude FT on the object along its direction of motion the whole time. During segment 2 only, a frictional force of magnitude Ff is also exerted on the object.",
    "question": "For another identical object initially at rest, no frictional force is exerted during segment 2 (between t = 2 s and t = 4 s). A rope exerts the same constant force of magnitude FT as in the previous scenario. What is the change in the object's kinetic energy during segment 2?",
