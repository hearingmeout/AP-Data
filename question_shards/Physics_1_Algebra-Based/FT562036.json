    "question": "A student is asked to determine the work done on a block of wood when the block is pulled horizontally using an attached string. The student is supplied with a spring scale, a stopwatch, and a meterstick. Which of the following graphical analysis techniques will allow the student to determine the work done on the block by the string?",
