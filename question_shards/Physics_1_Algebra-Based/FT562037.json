    "question": "Block A and block B move toward each other on a level frictionless track. Block A has mass m and velocity +v . Block B has mass 2m and velocity -v . The blocks collide, and during the collision the magnitude of the net force exerted on block A is F. What is the magnitude of the net force exerted on block B, and why does it have that value?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "2F, because the mass of block B is twice that of block A and the blocks have the same acceleration during the collision.",
