    "question": "Using a force probe, a student generates the graph above of the force exerted on a small wagon as a function of time. The wagon starts from rest and rolls with negligible friction in the axles. Which of the following graphs best represents the wagon’s momentum as a function of time?",

        "label": "The line on the graph begins at the origin, moves in a straight line up and to the right to time equals 2 seconds, moves horizontally to the right to time equals 4 seconds, and then moves in a straight line up and to the right until time equals 6 seconds with about the same slope as it had from zero to 2 seconds.",
