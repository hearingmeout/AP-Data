    "question": "A 0.050 kg tennis ball is moving to the left at 10 m/s when it is hit by a tennis racket that is moving to the right. The magnitude of the force exerted on the ball by the racket as a function of time is shown in the figure above. What is the speed of the ball after the collision with the racket?",
