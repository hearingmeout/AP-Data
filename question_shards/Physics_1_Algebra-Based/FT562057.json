    "question": "Box A of mass m sits on the floor of an elevator, with box B of mass 2m on top of it, as shown in the figure above. The elevator is moving upward and slowing down. FA is the magnitude of the force exerted on box A by box B, FB is the magnitude of the force exerted on box B by box A, and Fg is the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted on box B. Which of the following ranks the forces in order of increasing magnitude?",
