    "question": "The figure above shows a uniform beam of length L and mass M that hangs horizontally and is attached to a vertical wall. A block of mass M is suspended from the far end of the beam by a cable. A support cable runs from the wall to the outer edge of the beam. Both cables are of negligible mass. The wall exerts a force FW on the left end of the beam. For which of the following actions is the magnitude of the vertical component of FW smallest?",
