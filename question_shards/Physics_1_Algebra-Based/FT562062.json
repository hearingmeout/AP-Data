    "description": "The inclined plane in the figure above has two sections of equal length and different roughness. The dashed line shows where section 1 ends and section 2 begins. A block of mass M is placed at different locations on the incline. The coefficients of kinetic and static friction between the block and each section are shown in the table below.",
    "question": "If the block is sliding up section 2, what is the magnitude of the force of friction that is exerted on the block by the incline?",
