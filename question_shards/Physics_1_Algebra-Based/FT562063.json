    "question": "An object with mass m is suspended at rest from a spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m . The length of the spring is 5.0 cm longer than its unstretched length L, as shown above. A person then exerts a force on the object and stretches the spring an additional 5.0 cm. What is the total energy stored in the spring at the new stretched length?",
