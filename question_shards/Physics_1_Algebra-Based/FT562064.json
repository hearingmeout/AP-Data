    "question": "Two blocks are connected to identical ideal springs and are oscillating on a horizontal frictionless surface. Block A has mass m, and its motion is represented by the graph of position as a function of time shown above on the left. Block B’s motion is represented above on the right. Which of the following statements comparing block B to block A is correct?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Because block B covers more distance per cycle than block A, block B takes more time to complete each cycle.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because the spring attached to block B is initially stretched a greater distance, the spring constant is smaller and therefore block B has a slower average speed than block A does.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because block B has more mass, it has a slower average speed than block A does.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because block B has more mass, its acceleration is smaller than that of block A at any given displacement from the equilibrium position.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Because block B has more mass, its acceleration is smaller than that of block A at any given displacement from the equilibrium position."
