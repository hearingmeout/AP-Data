    "question": "A student releases a block of mass m from rest at the top of a slide of height h1. The block moves down the slide and off the end of a table of height h2 , landing on the floor a horizontal distance d from the edge of the table. Friction and air resistance are negligible. The overall height H of the setup is determined by the height of the room. Therefore, if h1 is increased, h2 must decrease by the same amount so that the sum h1 + h2 remains equal to H. The student wants to adjust h1 and h2 to make d as large as possible.\n\nWithout using equations, explain why making h1 very small would cause d to be small, even though h2 would be large.\n\nWithout using equations, explain why making h2 very small would cause d to be small, even though h1 would be large\n\nDerive an equation for d in terms of h1, h2, m, and physical constants, as appropriate.\n\nWrite the equation or step in your derivation in part (b) (not your final answer) that supports your reasoning in part (a)i.\n\nBriefly explain your choice.\n\nWrite the equation or step in your derivation in part (b) (not your final answer) that supports your reasoning in part (a)ii.\n\nBriefly explain your choice.\n\nIf the experiment is repeated on the Moon without changing h1 or h2 , will the new landing distance d be greater than, less than, or the same as the landing distance when the experiment is performed on Earth?\n\n_____Greater than _____Less than _____The same as\n\nBriefly explain your choice.",
