    "question": "Two ladybugs are standing on a rotating disk that is spinning counterclockwise, as shown in the figure above. Assume that friction in the bearings of the axle is negligible.\n\nIs the angular speed of ladybug A greater than, less than, or the same as the angular speed of ladybug B ?\n\n_____Greater _____Less _____The same\n\nBriefly justify your answer.\n\nIs the linear speed of ladybug A greater than, less than, or the same as the linear speed of ladybug B ?\n\n_____Greater _____Less _____The same\n\nBriefly justify your answer.\n\nLadybug A begins walking in a circular path in the direction of the disk’s rotation. Does the magnitude of the angular momentum of the disk alone (not the ladybugs-disk system) increase, decrease, or stay the same?\n\n_____Increase _____Decrease _____Stay the same\n\nBriefly justify your answer.\n\nIn a different scenario, a single ladybug is standing near the edge of the disk at a distance of 0.9R from the center, where R is the radius of the disk, as shown in Figure 1 below. The rotational inertia of the ladybugdisk system is I1 , and the disk completes one rotation in 2.5 s. The ladybug then walks toward the center of the disk to a distance of 0.1R from the center and comes to a stop relative to the disk, as shown in Figure 2. Now the rotational inertia of the system is I2, and the disk completes one rotation every 2.0 s.\n\nDerive an equation for I2 in terms of I1\n\nWhile the ladybug is walking toward the center of the disk, does it exert a torque on the disk?\n\n_____Yes ____No\n\nBriefly explain your reasoning.",
