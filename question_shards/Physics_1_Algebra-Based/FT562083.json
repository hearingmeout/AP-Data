    "question": "Block A of mass 2.0 kg is released from rest at the top of a 3.6 m long plane inclined at an angle of 30º, as shown in the figure above. After sliding on the horizontal surface, block A hits and sticks to block B, which is at rest and has mass 3.0 kg. Assume friction is negligible. The speed of the blocks after the collision is most nearly",
