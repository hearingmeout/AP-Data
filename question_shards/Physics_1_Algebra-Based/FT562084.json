    "question": "A student is asked to move a box from ground level to the top of a loading dock platform, as shown in the figures above. In Figure 1, the student pushes the box up an incline with negligible friction. In Figure 2, the student lifts the box straight up from ground level to the loading dock platform. In which case does the student do more work on the box, and why?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Lifting the box straight up, because it requires a larger applied force to lift it straight up",

        "label": "Pushing the box up the incline, because the force is applied for a longer distance",

        "label": "Neither method, because the work is the same in both cases, since using the ramp decreases the force by the same factor that it increases the distance",
