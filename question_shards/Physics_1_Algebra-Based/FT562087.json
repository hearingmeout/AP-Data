    "question": "A student uses a spring scale to exert a horizontal force on a block, pulling the block over a smooth floor. The student repeats the procedure several times, each time pulling the block from rest through a distance of 1.0 m. For which of the following graphs of force as a function of distance will the block be moving the fastest at the end of the 1.0 m?",
