    "question": "A soft foam block of mass m slides without friction in the positive x-direction with speed v. At time t = 0 , a student briefly pushes the block with a force probe in the positive x-direction. The graph above shows the force probe’s measurements as a function of time during the push. Which of the following statements is true about the block’s momentum between t = 0 and t = t1?",
