    "question": "A cart is moving on a level track in the positive x-direction. A force acting parallel to the x-axis is exerted on the cart. The graph above shows the net force exerted on the cart as a function of displacement. As the cart travels from x = 0 m to x = 4 m , what is the net change in the kinetic energy of the cart?",
