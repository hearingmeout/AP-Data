    "question": "Steel sphere A of mass M is moving along a horizontal surface with constant speed v. Identical steel sphere B is at rest and hangs on a string of length R attached to a support at point P, as shown in the figure above. The spheres collide, and as a result sphere A stops and sphere B swings a vertical height h before coming momentarily to rest. Knowing values for which of the following will allow determination of the angular impulse on sphere B with respect to P due to the collision?",
