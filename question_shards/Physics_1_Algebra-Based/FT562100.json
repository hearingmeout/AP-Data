    "question": "A 1.0 kg block is attached to an unstretched spring of spring constant 50 N/m and released from rest from the position shown in Figure 1 above. The block oscillates for a while and eventually stops moving 0.20 m below its starting point, as shown in Figure 2. What is the change in potential energy of the block-spring-Earth system between Figure 1 and Figure 2 ?",
