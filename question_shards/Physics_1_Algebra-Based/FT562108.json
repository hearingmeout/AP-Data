    "question": "The figure above shows a uniform meterstick that is set on a fulcrum at its center. A force of magnitude F toward the bottom of the page is exerted on the meterstick at the position shown. At which of the labeled positions must an upward force of magnitude 2F be exerted on the meterstick to keep the meterstick in equilibrium?",
