    "question": "Two astronauts are connected by a taut cable and are initially at rest with respect to a nearby space station. Astronaut X throws a large container to Astronaut Y. Figure 1 above shows the astronauts immediately after the container is thrown by Astronaut X, and Figure 2 shows the astronauts immediately after the container is caught by Astronaut Y. Which of the following describes the motion of Astronaut Y in Figures 1 and 2 ?",
