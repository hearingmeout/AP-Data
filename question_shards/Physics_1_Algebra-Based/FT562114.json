    "question": "The graph above shows the force exerted by a spring as a function of the length of the spring. A block on a frictionless table is pushed against the spring that is fastened to a wall. The spring is compressed until its length is 20 cm. The block is then released. Which of the following values is closest to the kinetic energy with which the block leaves the spring?",
