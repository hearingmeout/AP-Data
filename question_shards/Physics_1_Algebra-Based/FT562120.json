    "question": "A small cart is rolling freely on an inclined ramp with a constant acceleration of 0.50 m/s2 in the -x direction. At time t = 0, the cart has a velocity of 2.0 m/s in the +x-direction. If the cart never leaves the ramp, which of the following statements correctly describes the motion of the cart at a time t > 5 s?",
