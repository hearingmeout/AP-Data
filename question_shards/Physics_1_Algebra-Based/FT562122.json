    "question": "A box of mass m is on a rough inclined plane that is at an angle θ with the horizontal. A force of magnitude F at an angle Φ with the plane is exerted on the block, as shown above. As the block moves up the plane, there is a frictional force between the box and the plane of magnitude f. What is the magnitude of the net force acting on the box?",
