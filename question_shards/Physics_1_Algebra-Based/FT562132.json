    "question": "A pendulum consisting of a sphere suspended from a light string is oscillating with a small angle with respect to the vertical. The sphere is then replaced with a new sphere of the same size but greater density and is set into oscillation with the same angle. How do the period, maximum kinetic energy, and maximum acceleration of the new pendulum compare to those of the original pendulum?",
