    "question": "A force F is exerted on a 5 kg block to move it across a rough surface, as shown above. The magnitude of the force is initially 5 N, and the block moves at a constant velocity. While the block is moving, the force is instantaneously increased to 12 N. How much kinetic energy does the block now gain as it moves a distance of 2 m?",
