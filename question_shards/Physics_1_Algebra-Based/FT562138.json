    "question": "A disk of known radius and rotational inertia can rotate without friction in a horizontal plane around its fixed central axis. The disk has a cord of negligible mass wrapped around its edge. The disk is initially at rest, and the cord can be pulled to make the disk rotate. Which of the following procedures would best determine the relationship between applied torque and the resulting change in angular momentum of the disk?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Pulling on the cord, exerting a force of 15 N for 2 s and then 25 N for 3 s, and measuring the final angular velocity of the disk",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "For five different time intervals, pulling on the cord, exerting a force of 15 N, and then measuring the angle through which the disk rotates in each case",
