    "question": "The figure above represents the orbits of two planets of equal mass that orbit their star in the counterclockwise direction as a double-planet system. From the point of view of an observer on either planet, the planets appear to orbit each other while also orbiting the star. The dots on the orbits represent the position of the planets at time t0, and X is the position of their center of mass at that time. Which of the following arrows best represents the acceleration of the center of mass of the double-planet system when it is at point X ?",
