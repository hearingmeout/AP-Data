    "question": "A person holds a book at rest a few feet above a table. The person then lowers the book at a slow constant speed and places it on the table. Which of the following accurately describes the change in the total mechanical energy of the Earth-book system?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The total mechanical energy is unchanged, because there is no change in the book’s kinetic energy as it is lowered to the table.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The total mechanical energy is unchanged, because no work is done on the Earth-book system while the book is lowered.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The total mechanical energy decreases, because the person does positive work on the book by exerting a force that opposes the gravitational force.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The total mechanical energy decreases, because the person does negative work on the book by exerting a force on the book in the direction opposite to its displacement.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The total mechanical energy decreases, because the person does negative work on the book by exerting a force on the book in the direction opposite to its displacement."
