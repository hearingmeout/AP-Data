    "description": "A system consists of two spheres, of mass m and 2m, connected by a rod of negligible mass, as shown above. The system is held at its center of mass with the rod horizontal and released from rest near Earth’s surface at time t = 0 .",
    "question": "The graph above shows the rate of change of linear momentum of the sphere of mass m as a function of time. What is the linear momentum of the two-sphere system at time t = 3.0 s ?",
