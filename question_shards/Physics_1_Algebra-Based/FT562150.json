    "description": "A system consists of two spheres, of mass m and 2m, connected by a rod of negligible mass, as shown above. The system is held at its center of mass with the rod horizontal and released from rest near Earth’s surface at time t = 0 .",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains why the system does not rotate around its center of mass as it falls?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The Earth exerts the same gravitational force on both spheres, causing them to accelerate at the same rate.",

      {
        "label": "The Earth exerts the same gravitational force on both spheres, generating torques that cancel out.",

      {
        "label": "The Earth exerts a larger gravitational force on the sphere of mass 2m, but that sphere is closer to the center of mass and the torques cancel out.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The Earth exerts a larger gravitational force on the sphere of mass 2m, but that sphere has more inertia and the torques cancel out.",
