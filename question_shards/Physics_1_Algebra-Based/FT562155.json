    "question": "An athlete with mass m running at speed v grabs a light rope that hangs from a ceiling of height H and swings to a maximum height of h1. In another room with a lower ceiling of height H/2 , a second athlete with mass 2m running at the same speed v grabs a light rope hanging from the ceiling and swings to a maximum height of h2 . How does the maximum height reached by the two athletes compare, and why?",
