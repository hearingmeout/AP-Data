    "description": "Two identical spaceships are traveling in deep space, far from any planets or stars. The ships travel in the same direction, with the slower one directly behind the faster one. The ships are connected by a cable attached to a spool, so that the part of the cable outside the ships can be made longer or shorter as needed. The cable is used to bring the ships to the same speed for a transfer of cargo. The graph above shows the speed of the two ships during a 10 s interval.",
