    "question": "Cart A has mass M and is released from rest at a height 2H on a ramp making an angle 2θ with the horizontal, as shown above. Cart B has mass 2M and is released from rest at a height H on a ramp making an angle θ with the horizontal. The carts roll toward each other, have a head-on collision on the horizontal portion of the ramp, and stick together. The masses of the carts’ wheels are negligible, as are any frictional or drag forces.\n\nIndicate whether the carts remain at rest, move to the left, or move to the right after the collision.\n\n____ Remain at rest ____ Move to the left ____ Move to the right\n\nExplain how you arrived at your answer.\n\nConsider the time interval from when the two carts are released until just after they collide.\n\nFor the system consisting of the two carts and Earth, indicate whether the total mechanical energy increases, decreases, or remains the same.\n\n____ Increases ____ Decreases ____ Remains the same\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nFor the system consisting of only the two carts, indicate whether the total mechanical energy increases, decreases, or remains the same.\n\n____ Increases ____ Decreases ____ Remains the same\n\nJustify your answer.",
