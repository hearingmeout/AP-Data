    "question": "A toy car coasts along the curved track shown above. The car has initial speed vA when it is at point A at the top of the track, and the car leaves the track at point B with speed vB at an angle θ above the horizontal. Assume that the rotational kinetic energy of the car’s wheels and energy losses due to friction are both negligible. Suppose the toy car is released from rest at point A (vA = 0 ). After the car leaves the track and reaches the highest point in its trajectory it will be at a different height than it was at point A. Briefly explain why this is so. Determine the speed of the car when it is at the highest point in its trajectory after leaving the track, in terms of vB and θ. Briefly explain how you arrived at your answer. Suppose the toy car is given an initial push so that it has nonzero speed at point A. Determine the speed Av of the car at point A such that the highest point in its trajectory after leaving the track is the same as its height at point A. Express your answer in terms of vB and θ. Explain how you arrived at your answer.",
