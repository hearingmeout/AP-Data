    "question": "A spacecraft of mass m is in a clockwise circular orbit of radius R around Earth, as shown in the figure above.\n\nThe mass of Earth is ME.\n\nIn the figure below, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the spacecraft. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the spacecraft.\n\nDerive an equation for the orbital period T of the spacecraft in terms of m, ME, R, and physical constants, as appropriate. If you need to draw anything other than what you have shown in part (a) to assist in your solution, use the space below. Do NOT add anything to the figure in part (a).\n\nA second spacecraft of mass 2m is placed in a circular orbit with the same radius R. Is the orbital period of the second spacecraft greater than, less than, or equal to the orbital period of the first spacecraft?\n\n____Greater than ____Less than ____Equal to\n\nBriefly explain your reasoning.\n\nThe first spacecraft is moved into a new circular orbit that has a radius greater than R, as shown in the figure below.\n\nIs the speed of the spacecraft in the new orbit greater than, less than, or equal to the original speed?\n\n____Greater than ____Less than ____Equal to\n\nBriefly explain your reasoning.",
