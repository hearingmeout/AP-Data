    "question": "Two blocks are on a horizontal, frictionless surface. Block A is moving with an initial velocity of v0 toward block B, which is stationary, as shown above. The two blocks collide, stick together, and move off with a velocity of v0/3 . Which block, if either, has the greater mass?",
