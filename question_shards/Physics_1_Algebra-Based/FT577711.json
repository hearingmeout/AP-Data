    "question": "A box of mass m is initially at rest at the top of a ramp that is at an angle θ with the horizontal. The block is at a height h and length L from the bottom of the ramp. The block is released and slides down the ramp. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the ramp is µ . What is the kinetic energy of the box at the bottom of the ramp?",
