    "description": "A cylinder at rest is released from the top of a ramp, as shown above. The ramp is 1.0 m high, and the cylinder rolls down the ramp without slipping. At the bottom of the ramp, the cylinder makes a smooth transition to a small section of a horizontal table and then travels over the edge at a height of 1.0 m above the floor, eventually landing on the floor at a horizontal distance of 1.5 m from the table.",
    "question": "As the cylinder rolls down the ramp, how do the potential energy of the cylinder-Earth system and the kinetic energy of the cylinder change, if at all?",
