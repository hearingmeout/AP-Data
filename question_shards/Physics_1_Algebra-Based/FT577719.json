    "description": "A cylinder at rest is released from the top of a ramp, as shown above. The ramp is 1.0 m high, and the cylinder rolls down the ramp without slipping. At the bottom of the ramp, the cylinder makes a smooth transition to a small section of a horizontal table and then travels over the edge at a height of 1.0 m above the floor, eventually landing on the floor at a horizontal distance of 1.5 m from the table.",
    "question": "A sphere with the same mass and radius as the original cylinder, but a smaller rotational inertia, is released from rest from the top of the ramp. Ks and Kc are the sphere’s and the cylinder’s total kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp, respectively. How do Ks and Kc compare, and why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Ks < Kc, because the sphere will gain less rotational kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Ks < Kc, because the sphere has a greater acceleration and therefore has less time to gain kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Ks = Kc, because both objects accelerate at the same rate.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Ks = Kc , because the gravitational force does equal work on each object as it rolls down the ramp.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Ks = Kc , because the gravitational force does equal work on each object as it rolls down the ramp."
