    "question": "A block is released from rest and slides down a frictionless ramp inclined at 30° from the horizontal. When the block reaches the bottom, the block-Earth system has mechanical energy E0. The experiment is repeated, but now horizontal and vertical forces of magnitude F are exerted on the block while it slides, as shown above. When the block reaches the bottom, the mechanical energy of the block-Earth system",
