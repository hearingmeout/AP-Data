    "question": "An apple is released from rest 500 m above the ground. Due to the combined forces of air resistance and gravity, it has a speed of 40 m s when it reaches the ground. What percentage of the initial mechanical energy of the apple-Earth system was dissipated due to air resistance? Take the potential energy of the apple-Earth system to be zero when the apple reaches the ground.",
