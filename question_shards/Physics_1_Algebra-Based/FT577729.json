    "question": "A 2.5 g marshmallow is placed in one end of a 40 cm pipe, as shown in the figure above. A person blows into the left end of the pipe to eject the marshmallow from the right end. The average net force exerted on the marshmallow while it is in the pipe is 0.7 N. The speed of the marshmallow as it leaves the pipe is most nearly",
