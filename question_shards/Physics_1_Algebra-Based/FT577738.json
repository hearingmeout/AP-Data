    "question": "The figure above shows a rod that is fixed to a horizontal surface at pivot P. The rod is initially rotating without friction in the counterclockwise direction. At time t, three forces of equal magnitude are applied to the rod as shown. Which of the following is true about the angular speed and direction of rotation of the rod immediately after time t ?",
