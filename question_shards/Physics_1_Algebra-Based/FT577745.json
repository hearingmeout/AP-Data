    "question": "A hollow plastic ball is projected into the air. There is significant air resistance opposing the ball’s motion, so the magnitude of the ball’s acceleration is not equal to g. At time t, the ball is moving up and to the right at an angle of 45° to the horizontal, as shown above. Which of the following best shows the magnitude a and the direction of the ball’s acceleration at time t ?",
