    "question": "At time t = 0 two figure skaters are moving together over ice with negligible friction, as shown above. Skater 1, represented by the large black dot, is twice as massive as skater 2, represented by the gray dot. At t = 2 s the skaters push off of one another. The location of skater 1 is shown at t = 4 s . At t = 4 s , skater 2 is located at which of the labeled points?",
