    "question": "A student predicts that a block sliding down a ramp inclined at <math alttext=\"45\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>45</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> degrees should have an acceleration of approximately <math alttext=\"7 meters per second squared\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>7</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext> </mtext><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>/</mo><msup><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math>. The block is released from rest, and the student measures the distance the block travels and the time it takes to travel that distance. The student determines that the block’s acceleration is only <math alttext=\"5.5 meters per second squared\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5.5</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext> </mtext><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>/</mo><msup><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math>.
