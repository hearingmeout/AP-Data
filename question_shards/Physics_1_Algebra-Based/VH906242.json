      {
        "label": "The figure presents a dot diagram showing the position of the object at 6 equal time intervals. In each of the 6 time intervals, the object moves directly to the right by a constant amount of distance.",

In addition to the horizontal movement, for each time interval the object moves downward by a larger amount than it did in the previous time interval.",
