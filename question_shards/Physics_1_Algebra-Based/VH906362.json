    "question": "A tennis ball is thrown against a vertical concrete wall that is fixed to the ground. The ball bounces off the wall. How does the force exerted by the ball on the wall compare with the force exerted by the wall on the ball?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The force exerted by the ball is greater.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The forces exerted by the ball and the wall have the same magnitude.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The force exerted by the ball is smaller.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The relative magnitudes of the forces cannot be determined without knowing how long the ball and the wall are in contact.",

    ],
    "answer": "The forces exerted by the ball and the wall have the same magnitude."
