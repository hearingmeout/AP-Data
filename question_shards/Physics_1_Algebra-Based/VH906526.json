    "description": "Students work together during an experiment about Newton’s laws. The students use a setup that consists of a cart of known mass connected to one end of a string that is looped over a pulley of negligible friction, with its other end connected to a hanging mass. The cart is initially at rest on a horizontal surface and rolls without slipping when released. The inertia of the cart's wheels is negligible. Students have access to common laboratory equipment to make measurements of components of the system.",
    "question": "The students double the mass that hangs from the string. They also replace the original cart with a new cart that has double the mass. By doubling both masses, how will the tension in the string and the acceleration of the cart change?",
