    "question": "Two blocks, with masses indicated in the figure above, are at rest on a horizontal surface and connected by a string of negligible mass and a compressed spring. There is negligible friction between the blocks and the surface. The string is cut, and the spring pushes the blocks away from each other. Which of the following statements are true about the motion of the blocks immediately after the string is cut? Select two answers.",
