    "description": "A potato falling vertically downward is struck by a dart that is traveling vertically upward, as shown above. The dart and potato then collide, stick together, and continue moving after the collision.",
    "question": "Consider the dart-potato system. Which of the following graphs best represents the speed v of the center-of-mass of the dart-potato system, as a function of time t, before, during, and after the collision?",
