    "question": "A ball is dropped onto the floor and bounces upward. Which of the following claims are correct about the force that the ball exerts on the floor compared to the force that the floor exerts on the ball when the ball and the floor are in contact?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The ball exerts a greater force on the floor because the ball travels with a high speed, whereas the floor is at rest.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The ball exerts a greater force on the floor because the ball is accelerating.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The magnitude of the forces exerted by both objects is the same because the ball and the floor cannot exert forces of different magnitudes on each other.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The magnitude of the forces exerted by both objects is the same because the gravitational force exerted by the ball on the floor and the gravitational force exerted on the floor by the ball must be the same.",
