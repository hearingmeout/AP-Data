    "question": "Two identical books are stacked on a table. A third identical book is then placed on top of the first two, causing an increase in the normal force exerted by the bottom book on the middle book. Which of the following is a correct explanation for the increase in this normal force?",

      {
        "label": "The normal force on an object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of gravity on that object.",
