    "question": "Two bricks are stacked on a floor. A student draws the force diagram for brick 2, as shown above. The forces are an upward normal force, a downward force exerted by brick 1, and a downward gravitational force. How many of the forces, if any, in the force diagram are contact forces caused by microscopic interactions?",
