    "question": "An object travels down a ramp at a constant acceleration. The object experiences a force of friction and a gravitational force. Which of the following could be true about the motion of the object?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The force of friction between the surface and the object is less than the component of the gravitational force that is parallel to the ramp.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "If the object increased in mass, the object’s acceleration would change.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "If the object increased in mass, the normal force exerted on the object would remain the same.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The force of friction acts in the same direction as the object travels.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The force of friction between the surface and the object is less than the component of the gravitational force that is parallel to the ramp."
