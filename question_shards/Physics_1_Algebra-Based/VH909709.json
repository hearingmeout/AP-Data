        "label": "Place the object on one side of a lever at a known distance away from a fulcrum. Place known masses on the other side of the fulcrum so that they are also placed on the lever at known distances from the fulcrum. Move the known masses to a known distance such that the lever is in static equilibrium.",

Use a surface such that the coefficient of friction between the object and the surface is known. Pull the object horizontally across the surface with a spring scale at a nonconstant speed such that a motion detector can measure how the object's speed as a function of time changes.",
