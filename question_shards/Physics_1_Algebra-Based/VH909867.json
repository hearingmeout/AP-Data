    "question": "One end of a string is attached to the ceiling with the other end attached to a toy. The toy can be set into motion such that it travels in a horizontal circular path at a constant tangential speed, as shown above. The toy experiences a component of the tension force toward the center of the circular path that serves as the centripetal force exerted on the toy. Which of the following measurements could a student use to determine the net centripetal force exerted on the toy? Select two answers.",
