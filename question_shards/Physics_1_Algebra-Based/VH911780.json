    "question": "An amusement park ride has two identical carriages that revolve around the center of the ride’s axle, as shown in the figure. Both carts travel at a constant tangential speed at all points along the circular path. At what position is the total mechanical energy of the cart-cart-Earth system at its maximum value?",
