    "question": "An object is released from a large height above the ground and takes a very long time to reach the ground. The only forces exerted on the object are the force of Earth's gravity and the force of friction exerted by Earth’s atmosphere as the object falls. A graph of the object’s speed <math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is shown above. Which of the following claims best describes the force of friction exerted on the object?",
