    "description": "A student wants to investigate the motion of a ball by conducting two different experiments, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 above. In Experiment 1, the student releases a ball from rest and uses a slow-motion camera to film the ball as it falls to the ground. Using video analysis, the student is able to plot the ball’s horizontal position <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and vertical position <math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. In Experiment 2, the student horizontally rolls the same ball off a table, and uses video analysis to plot the ball’s horizontal position <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and vertical position <math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> starting from the instant the ball leaves the table. The graphs from each experiment are shown above along with each graph’s best-fit curve line.",
    "question": "Which of the following conclusions can the student draw from the graphs, and why?",
