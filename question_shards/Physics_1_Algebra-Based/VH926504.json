    "question": "A book is at rest on the top of a table. A student makes the following claim: “An attractive electromagnetic force is exerted on the book from the table, and this force can also be classified as the normal force.” Which of the following statements correctly justifies the student's claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The claim is correct because the charged particles of the table exert a downward attractive force on the charged particles of the book.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is correct because the charged particles of the table exert a downward repulsive force on the charged particles of the book.",
        "image": null
