    "question": "A student uses both hands to push a door such that it moves and swings open after the force has been applied. The student then makes the following claim: “I can use both of my hands to apply a constant force on my body so that my body falls backward.” Which of the following statements correctly justifies the student's claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The claim is correct because the situation is the same as if another person’s hands applied a force on the student.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is correct because the student’s hands will exert a net force on the student’s body.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is not correct because the student’s hands cannot exert a force on the student’s body.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is not correct because the student’s body will exert a force of equal magnitude back on the student’s hands as a result of Newton’s third law of motion.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The claim is not correct because the student’s body will exert a force of equal magnitude back on the student’s hands as a result of Newton’s third law of motion."
