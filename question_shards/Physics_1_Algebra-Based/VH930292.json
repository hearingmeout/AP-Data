    "question": "A planet moves in an elliptical orbit around a star, as shown in the diagram. Which of the following is true as the planet moves from position 1 to position 2?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The planet loses kinetic energy due to negative gravitational work; thus, the total energy in the planet-star system decreases.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The planet’s kinetic energy increases due to positive gravitational work; thus, the total energy in the planet-star system increases.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Kinetic energy decreases and gravitational potential energy increases, but the total energy in the planet-star system stays constant.",

        "label": "Potential energy decreases and kinetic energy increases, but the total energy in the planet-star system stays constant.",
