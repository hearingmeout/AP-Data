    "question": "The small block shown in the figure above was released from rest at point <math alttext=\"O\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>O</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> and slid down the track such that friction was considered to be negligible. The block reached point <math alttext=\"P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>P</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> with speed <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>. Between points <math alttext=\"O\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>O</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>P</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, what kind of work did the track do on the block, and why?",
