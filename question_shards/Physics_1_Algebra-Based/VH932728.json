    "question": "An object is spun in a horizontal circle such that it has a constant tangential speed at all points along its circular path of constant radius. A graph of the magnitude of the object’s tangential speed as a function of time is shown in the graph. Which of the following graphs could show the magnitude of the object’s centripetal acceleration as a function of time?",
