    "question": "A student performs an experiment in which the horizontal position of a toy car is recorded on ticker tape from a device that places dots on the tape in equal time intervals. The series of dots in the figure represents the motion of an object moving from the negative direction to the positive direction along the horizontal direction. The time interval between each recorded dot is <math alttext=\"1 second\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.4em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. Which of the following experiments could the student have conducted to create the data shown on the ticker tape?",
