    "question": "Two blocks are tied together with a string. They are thrown onto a layer of ice such that they spin around their center of mass <math alttext=\"C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as they slide horizontally across the icy surface, as shown in the figure. A graph of the two-block system’s velocity as a function of time is shown. Based on the graph, which of the following claims are correct about the system? Select two answers.",
