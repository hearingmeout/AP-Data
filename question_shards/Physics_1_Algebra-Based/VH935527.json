    "description": "A student conducts an experiment in which an object is released from rest above a motion detector so that data can be collected about the object’s motion as the object falls to the ground. The experiment is conducted near Earth’s surface. All frictional forces are considered to be negligible unless otherwise stated.",
    "question": "The student wants to collect data to determine the work done by the force due to gravity on the object as it falls. Which of the following lists contains the fewest number of measuring devices, in addition to the motion detector, that the student can use?",
