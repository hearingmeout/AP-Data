    "description": "A student conducts an experiment in which an object is released from rest above a motion detector so that data can be collected about the object’s motion as the object falls to the ground. The experiment is conducted near Earth’s surface. All frictional forces are considered to be negligible unless otherwise stated.",
    "question": "The student collects the data necessary to graph the object’s kinetic energy as a function of time, as shown. Which of the following graphs represents the sum of the kinetic energy <math alttext=\"K\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and gravitational potential energy <math alttext=\"U sub g\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> of the object-Earth system as a function of time?",
