    "question": "For the system that only includes the object, which of the following claims best describes what happens to the mechanical energy of the system while the object is moving from the bottom of the ramp to the top of the ramp?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy of the object increases because the gravitational potential energy increases as the object moves up the ramp.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy of the object decreases because the force due to gravity from Earth does negative work on the object as it moves up the ramp.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy of the object is constant because the kinetic energy of the object is constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A determination of the change of the mechanical energy of the object cannot be made without knowing the power of the motor that is used to move the conveyor belt.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The mechanical energy of the object is constant because the kinetic energy of the object is constant."
