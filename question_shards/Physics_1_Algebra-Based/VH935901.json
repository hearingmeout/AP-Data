    "description": "A student is conducting an experiment to analyze the mechanical energy of a block-spring system. The student places a block of mass <math alttext=\"2 kilograms\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>kg</mtext></mrow></math> on a horizontal surface and attaches the block to a horizontal spring of negligible mass and spring constant <math alttext=\"100 newtons per meter\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>100</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>N/m</mtext></mrow></math>, as shown in the figure. There is negligible friction between the block and the horizontal surface. The other end of the spring is attached to a wall. The block-spring system is initially at the spring’s equilibrium position.",
    "question": "The student wants to collect data of the block-spring system that can be used to determine the work done on the spring by the block when the spring is compressed. Which of the following includes only the measuring devices that the student will need in order to collect the data?",
