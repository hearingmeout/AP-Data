    "question": "A student drops an object from rest above a force plate that records information about the force exerted on the object as a function of time during the time interval in which the object is in contact with the force plate. Which of the following measurements should the student take, in addition to the measurements from the force plate, to determine the change in momentum of the object from immediately before the collision to immediately after the collision?",
