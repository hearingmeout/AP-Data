    "question": "A student must conduct an experiment in which a block is pulled across a horizontal surface by a spring scale so that a nonzero change in momentum of the block can be determined for a specific time interval. The student also has access to measuring tools that are found in a typical physics laboratory. Which of the following experiments could the student conduct to determine the change in momentum of the cart? Select two answers.",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Attach the spring scale to the block, and pull the block at a constant speed as it travels across the horizontal surface. Record the force that the spring scale exerts on the block. Use a stopwatch to determine the time that the block is in motion.",

Use the motion detector to record the speed of the block at the beginning of the time interval and at the end of the time interval. Use a mass balance to measure the mass of the block.",
