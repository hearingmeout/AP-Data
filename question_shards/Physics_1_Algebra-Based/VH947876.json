    "question": "A block of known mass <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is at rest at the base of a ramp. A second identical block of mass <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> travels at a known, constant velocity <math alttext=\"v sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, as shown in Figure 1. The block that travels at a constant speed collides with and sticks to the first block. Both blocks slide up the ramp and travel with an unknown velocity <math alttext=\"v sub R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> at the top of the ramp, as shown in Figure 2. All frictional forces are considered to be negligible. Which quantity should the student measure, if any, to determine whether the conservation of momentum applies to the two-block system from immediately before the collision to immediately after the blocks have reached the top of the ramp while stuck together? Justify your selection.",
