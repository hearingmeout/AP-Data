    "description": "A group of students must study the oscillatory motion of a pendulum. One end of a light string is attached to the ceiling, and the other end of the string is attached to a mass hanger so that small disks of various masses may be stacked on the hanger, as shown in the figure.",
    "question": "The students want to determine how the length of the pendulum affects the period of the pendulum. Which of the following procedures should the students use to conduct the experiment?",
