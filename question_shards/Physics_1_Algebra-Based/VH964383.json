    "description": "The students perform four experiments, as described.",
    "question": "Experiment 1: Determine the relationship between the mass of the pendulum and the period of oscillation. Experiment 2: Determine the relationship between the displacement of the pendulum and the period of oscillation. Experiment 3: Determine the relationship between the period of oscillation and the length of the pendulum. Experiment 4: Determine the relationship between the vertical release height of the hanger-disk system and its speed at the lowest point of its arc. The students collect data to create the graph that is shown, but the horizontal and vertical axes are not labeled. Which experiments could be represented by the graph?",
