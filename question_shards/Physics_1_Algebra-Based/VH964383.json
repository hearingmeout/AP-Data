    "description": "A group of students must study the oscillatory motion of a pendulum. One end of a light string is attached to the ceiling, and the other end of the string is attached to a mass hanger so that small disks of various masses may be stacked on the hanger, as shown in the figure.",
    "question": "The students perform four experiments, as described.\n\nExperiment 1: Determine the relationship between the mass of the pendulum and the period of oscillation.\n\nExperiment 2: Determine the relationship between the displacement of the pendulum and the period of oscillation.\n\nExperiment 3: Determine the relationship between the period of oscillation and the length of the pendulum.\n\nExperiment 4: Determine the relationship between the vertical release height of the hanger-disk system and its speed at the lowest point of its arc.\n\nThe students collect data to create the graph that is shown, but the horizontal and vertical axes are not labeled. Which experiments could be represented by the graph?",
