    "question": "A student attaches a block to a vertical spring so that the block-spring system will oscillate if the block-spring system is released from rest at a vertical position that is not the system’s equilibrium position. The system oscillates near Earth’s surface. The system is then taken to the Moon’s surface, where the gravitational field strength is nearly <math alttext=\"one sixth\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> that of the gravitational field strength near Earth's surface. Which of the following claims is correct about the period of oscillation for the system?",
