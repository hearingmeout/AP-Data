    "description": "An axle passes through a pulley. Each end of the axle has a string that is tied to a support. A third string is looped many times around the edge of the pulley and the free end attached to a block of mass <math alttext=\"lowercase m sub b\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> , which is held at rest. When the block is released, the block falls downward. Consider clockwise to be the positive direction of rotation, frictional effects from the axle are negligible, and the string wrapped around the disk never fully unwinds. The rotational inertia of the pulley is <math alttext=\"one half uppercase M R squared\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mi>M</mi><msup><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math> about its center of mass.",
