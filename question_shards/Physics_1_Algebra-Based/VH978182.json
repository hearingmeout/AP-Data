    "question": "Consider the situation shown above in which the center of the meterstick is aligned with the center of the cradle, which is at a position of <math alttext=\"x equals 0 meters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>m</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. The system is released from rest. Which of the following claims is correct about the motion of the system containing the meterstick, cradle, and two objects if the system is free to rotate?",
