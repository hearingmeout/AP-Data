    "question": "For a given experiment, the students know how much the angular momentum of the system has changed after a specific time interval. The students create a series of graphs for each experiment. The students must determine if the change in angular momentum of a given system is equal to the angular impulse applied to the system. How should the students use data from a particular graph to make the determination by using only the graph?",
