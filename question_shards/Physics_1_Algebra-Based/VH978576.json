After an unknown time interval, the disk comes to rest. A single point on the disk revolves around the center axle hundreds of times before the disk comes to rest. Frictional forces are considered to be constant.",
    "question": "In a different experiment, the original disk is replaced with a disk for which frictional forces are considered to be negligible. The disk is set into motion such that it rotates with a constant angular speed. As the disk spins, a small sphere of clay is dropped onto the disk, and the sphere sticks to the disk. Which of the following claims is correct about the angular momentum and the total kinetic energy of the disk-sphere system immediately before and immediately after the collision?",
