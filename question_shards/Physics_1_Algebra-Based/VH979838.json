    "question": "A vertically oriented rod may freely rotate around a horizontal axle through its center. A student applies a force on one end of the rod so that the rod rotates around the axis. The student collects the necessary data to generate the graph that is shown. After observing the data, the student makes the following statement.\n\n“For the time interval shown, the magnitude of the net torque exerted on the rod decreases over time.”\n\nDo the data support the student’s statement? Justify your selection.",
