    "question": "A group of students conduct an experiment on the rotational motion of a horizontal, rigid rod that is connected to a motor, as shown in the figure. The students collect the data necessary to create a graph of the angular velocity of the disk as a function of time. One student in the group states that the graph shows that a net external torque is exerted on the rod, because the rod’s angular momentum increased. Do the data support the student’s statement? Justify your selection.",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the angular velocity increases with time. Therefore, the angular momentum of the rod increases with time. This can only occur as the result of a net torque.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the area bound between the best-fit line of the data and the horizontal axis from <math alttext=\"0 second\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"10 seconds\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math> is a positive value. Therefore, the angular displacement of the rod is nonzero. This can only occur as the result of a net torque.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the slope of a best-fit line to the data is constant. Therefore, a net torque cannot have been exerted on the rod.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the graph does not contain enough information to make statements regarding the angular momentum and/or net torque exerted on the rod.",

    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because the angular velocity increases with time. Therefore, the angular momentum of the rod increases with time. This can only occur as the result of a net torque."
