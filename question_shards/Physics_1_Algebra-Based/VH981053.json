    "question": "A motor rotates an axle that is connected to one end of a rod, as shown in the figure. Students may adjust the speed at which the motor causes the axle and rod to rotate. During an experiment, what essential quantity or quantities should be measured or determined in order for the students to determine the rod’s change in angular momentum after <math alttext=\"8 seconds\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>8</mtext><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>? Justify your selection.",
