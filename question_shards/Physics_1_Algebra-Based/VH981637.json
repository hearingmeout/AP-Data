    "question": "A rod of length <math alttext=\"2 D sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> and mass <math alttext=\"2 uppercase M sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> is at rest on a flat, horizontal surface. One end of the rod is connected to a pivot that the rod will rotate around if acted upon by a net torque. A sphere of mass <math alttext=\"lowercase m sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> is launched horizontally toward the free end of the rod with velocity <math alttext=\"v sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, as shown in the figure. After the sphere collides with the rod, the sphere sticks to the rod and both objects rotate around the pivot with a common angular velocity. Which of the following predictions is correct about angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy of the sphere-rod system immediately before the collision and immediately after the collision?",
