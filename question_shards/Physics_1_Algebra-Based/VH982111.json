    "question": "A student conducts an experiment in which one end of a rod may freely rotate around a pivot that is attached to its other end. The student collects the necessary data to construct a graph of the rod’s angular momentum as a function of time, as shown. The student makes the following claim.\n\n“This graph shows that the magnitude of the net torque exerted on the rod increases as time increases.”\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct about the student’s evaluation of the data from the graph? Justify your selection.",
