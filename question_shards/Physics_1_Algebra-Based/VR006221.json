    "question": "A block is released from rest and slides down a ramp. The surface of the ramp has three rough sections where the friction between the surface and the block is not negligible, as shown by the shaded regions above. Measuring which of the following will allow for the best estimate of the block’s instantaneous acceleration when the block is at the midpoint of the ramp?",
