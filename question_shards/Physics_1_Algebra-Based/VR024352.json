    "question": "A satellite in a circular orbit around Earth is initially not rotating with respect to its center of mass. Two identical thrusters on opposite sides of the satellite fire in opposite directions over the same <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>-minute time interval, as shown above, and then turn off. How does the firing of the thrusters affect the mechanical energy of the satellite-Earth system and the shape of the satellite’s orbit, if at all?",
