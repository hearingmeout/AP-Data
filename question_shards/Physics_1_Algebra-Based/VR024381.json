    "question": "A stationary cart attached to a force gauge is on a straight, horizontal, frictionless track. A student uses the force gauge to move the cart, and the gauge produces the graph of force as a function of time shown above. How does the momentum of the cart change during the time interval <math alttext=\"0 seconds\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mtext>0 s</mtext></mrow></math> to <math alttext=\"20 seconds\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>20 s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> ?",
