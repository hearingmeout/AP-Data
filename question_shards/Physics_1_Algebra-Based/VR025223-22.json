Assume equipment usually found in a school physics laboratory is available. In the table below, list the quantities and associated symbols that would be measured in your experiment and the equipment used to measure them. Also list the equipment that would be used to measure each quantity. You do not need to fill in every row. If you need additional rows, you may add them to the space just below the table. Quantity to Be Measured Symbol for Quantity Equipment for Measurement Describe the overall procedure to be used, referring to the table. Provide enough detail so another student could replicate the experiment, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty. As needed, use the symbols defined in the table and/or include a simple diagram of the setup.",
