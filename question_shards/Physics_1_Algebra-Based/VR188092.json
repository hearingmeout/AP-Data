    "question": "A projectile launched from a cliff at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> follows the path indicated by the dashed line in the above figure. The axes indicate the positive horizontal and vertical directions. Which of the following graphs could represent the projectile’s motion?",

The second line segment begins directly below where the first line segment ends, near the bottom of the vertical axis, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends. A dashed vertical line connects the two horizontal line segments.",
