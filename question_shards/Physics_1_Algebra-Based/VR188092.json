    "question": "A projectile launched from a cliff at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> follows the path indicated by the dashed line in the above figure. The axes indicate the positive horizontal and vertical directions. Which of the following graphs could represent the projectile’s motion?",

The horizontal axis is labeled t, and the vertical axis is labeled “Vertical Acceleration.” The first line segment begins on the vertical axis above the origin, and moves horizontally to the right until it reaches a point about one fourth of the way along the axis.
