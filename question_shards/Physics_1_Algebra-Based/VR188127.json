    "question": "A rock and a firecracker are each thrown into the air at the same angle and with the same initial speed. The rock follows the trajectory shown above on the left. The firecracker initially follows the same trajectory as the rock but explodes into three pieces at the point indicated above on the right. Which of the following describes the motion of the center of mass of the firecracker pieces after the explosion?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "It follows a path identical to the path of the rock.",
