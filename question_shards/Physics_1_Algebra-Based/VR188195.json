At its lowest point the sphere strikes a block of mass <math alttext=\"1 kilogram\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mtext>k</mtext><mtext>g</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math> that is initially at rest. Using measurements of the objects’ speeds taken by two motion detectors immediately before and after the collision, a student calculates that the total kinetic energy of the sphere-block system after the collision is significantly less than it was before the collision. Which of the following most plausibly explains this result?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The student made a mistake in obtaining data, because in a collision the kinetic energy must be conserved.",

        "label": "In calculating kinetic energy after the collision, the student did not account for the energy lost when the block slid on the table.",

        "label": "In calculating kinetic energy, the student did not consider the potential energy of the sphere-Earth system as the sphere was released.",
