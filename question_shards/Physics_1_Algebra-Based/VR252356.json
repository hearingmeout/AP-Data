    "question": "This question is a long free-response question. Show your work for each part of the question. (15 points, suggested time 25 minutes) A vertical support rod is fixed at the center of a platform. A light string of length L is attached to the top of the support rod, and the other end of the string is attached to a sphere of mass m, as shown above. The platform rotates with an angular speed that can be varied. When the platform rotates with a constant angular speed <math alttext=\"omega\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>ω</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> (omega), the string makes an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> (theta) with the rod. (a) The platform rotates with a constant angular speed. Which of the above graphs correctly shows the magnitude of the angular momentum of the platform as a function of time t about a vertical axis at the center of the support rod? Briefly justify your answer.",
