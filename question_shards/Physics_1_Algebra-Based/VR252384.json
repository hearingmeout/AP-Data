    "question": "This question is a long free-response question. Show your work for each part of the question. (15 points, suggested time 25 minutes) A spring-loaded launcher can be securely attached to a tabletop. When the spring is at its uncompressed length, the plunger is in the position shown above in Figure 1. A small wood block can be pressed against the end of the plunger, compressing the spring a distance <math alttext=\"L\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as shown in Figure 2. When the block is released, the plunger pushes the block along the tabletop. Two pins are attached to the edge of the table to prevent the plunger from extending beyond the table. When the plunger hits the pins, the block then leaves the table. There is nonnegligible friction between the block and the tabletop. The launcher can be moved closer to or farther from the edge of the tabletop. Students set up tables 1 and 2, as shown above, with tabletops that are made of the same material. On table 1, which is taller than table 2, the launcher is positioned so that the distance <math alttext=\"S equals A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> between the launcher and the edge of the tabletop is slightly less than <math alttext=\"L\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>.
