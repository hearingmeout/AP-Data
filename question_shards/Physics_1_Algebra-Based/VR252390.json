    "question": "This question is a long free-response question. Show your work for each part of the question. (15 points, suggested time 25 minutes) A block of mass <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is pulled by a rope that makes an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> (theta) above the horizontal, as shown above. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and floor is <math alttext=\"mu\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> (mu). The block is initially at rest and starts accelerating to the right along the floor. Three students each draw a diagram to indicate all of the forces that are exerted on the block as it moves. In the students’ diagrams, which are shown below, the lengths of the arrows indicate the relative magnitudes of the forces. Only one of the students has drawn a diagram that could correctly represent the forces. The other two students’ diagrams are incorrect. (a) Which student has drawn a diagram that could correctly represent the forces exerted on the block?",
