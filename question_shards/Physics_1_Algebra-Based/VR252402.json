        "text": "The original satellite is orbiting clockwise around Earth. When the satellite is at point A in the above figure, it fires a thruster (which exerts a force on the satellite) for a short time, modifying the orbital path. The dashed line in the figure shows the original orbit of the satellite, and the solid line shows the modified orbit. (c) Consider the force exerted by the thruster at point A that modifies the satellite's orbit from the dashed-line original orbit to the solid-line new orbit. Was the force exerted in the same direction as, in the opposite direction of, or perpendicular to the satellite’s velocity at point A? Explain your answer.",
