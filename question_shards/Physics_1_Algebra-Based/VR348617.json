    "question": "A person diving into a pool is initially rotating in a position with her legs pulled inward, as shown above in Figure 1. The person then stretches out her legs, as shown in Figure 2. Which of the following correctly describes the person’s rotational inertia and angular momentum about an axis though her center of mass in the two figures?",
