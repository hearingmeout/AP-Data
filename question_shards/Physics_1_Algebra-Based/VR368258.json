(7 points, suggested time 13 minutes) A student in a physics lab drops a ball of mass <math alttext=\"0.50 kilogram\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.50</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi>kg</mi></math> from a height of <math alttext=\"1.5 meters\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1.5</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></math> onto a force plate. The ball hits the force plate and rebounds upward. The student records the maximum height of the ball after it rebounds to be <math alttext=\"1.1 meters\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1.1</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></math>.
