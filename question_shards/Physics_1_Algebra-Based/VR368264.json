Show your work for each part of the question.\n\n(7 points, suggested time 13 minutes)\n\nTwo bars, bar 1 and bar 2, are at rest on a smooth horizontal table as shown in the top view above. Each bar is connected to the table with a vertical pin. Bar 1 and bar 2 are made from the same material and have the same physical dimensions, but bar 1 has three additional large holes drilled through it. The two bars are each accelerated from rest by forces of equal magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> applied at their right end. The forces remain perpendicular to the bars and the forces are exerted for an equal amount of time <math alttext=\"t sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>.\n\n(a) Briefly explain using physics principles why the angular displacement for bar 1 is larger than the angular displacement for bar 2.",
