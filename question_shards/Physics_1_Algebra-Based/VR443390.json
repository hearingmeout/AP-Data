    "question": "Carts 1 and 2 are initially moving toward each other, as shown in the top figure. The carts collide and afterward are both moving to the right, as shown in the bottom figure. If the positive direction is to the right, which of the following best represents the force exerted on each cart by the other during the collision as a function of time?",

The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Force.” The curve representing “on Cart 1” begins at the origin and moves downward and to the right at an accelerating rate until it reaches a trough far below the horizontal axis. It then moves upward and to the right until it levels off and ends on and near the end of the horizontal axis. The curve representing “on Cart 2” begins at the origin and moves upward and to the right at an accelerating rate until it reaches a peak far above the horizontal axis. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off and ends on and near the end of the horizontal axis. The peak and trough occur at the same point along the horizontal axis and are the same vertical distance from the horizontal axis.",
