    "question": "Block <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>A</mi></math> is set on a rough horizontal table and is connected to a horizontal spring that is fixed to a wall, as shown. Block <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>A</mi></math> is then also connected to hanging block <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>B</mi></math> by a lightweight string that passes over an ideal pulley, as shown. The friction force exerted on block A by the table is not negligible. The blocks are initially held at rest so that the spring is not stretched. When the blocks are released, hanging block <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>B</mi></math> moves downward and block <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>A</mi></math> on the table moves to the right until the system comes again to rest. Let <math alttext=\"E sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> be the mechanical energy of the blocks-spring system, and let <math alttext=\"E sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> be the mechanical energy of the blocks-spring-Earth system. How do these two energies change from when the blocks are held at rest to when the blocks come to rest again?\n\nBlocks-Spring System\n Blocks-Springs-Earth System\n\nA\n Increases\n Decreases\n\nB\n Decreases\n Increases\n\nC\n Remains constant\n Decreases\n\nD\n Remains constant\n Remains constant",
