    "question": "A vertical spring launcher is attached to the top of a block and a ball is placed in the launcher, as shown in the figure. While the block slides at constant speed to the right across a horizontal surface with negligible friction between the block and the surface, the ball is launched upward. When the ball reaches its maximum height, what will be the position of the ball relative to the spring launcher?",
