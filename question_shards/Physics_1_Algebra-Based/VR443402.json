    "question": "A bicycle wheel of known rotational inertia is free to rotate about its central axis. With the wheel initially at rest, a student wraps a string around the wheel and pulls the string with a spring scale, causing the wheel to rotate. The student records the tension in the string and the time for which the string was pulled. Without measuring the wheel’s final angular speed, can the student find the magnitude of the wheel’s final angular momentum, and what is a correct explanation?",

        "label": "Yes. The student also needs to measure the wheel’s radius to calculate the torque exerted on the wheel.",

        "label": "No. Angular momentum can only be found by measuring rotational inertia and angular speed.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No. Measuring the radius would allow the student to calculate the torque, not the angular momentum.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes. The student also needs to measure the wheel’s radius to calculate the torque exerted on the wheel."
