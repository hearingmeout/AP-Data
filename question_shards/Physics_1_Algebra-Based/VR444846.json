    "question": "Two identical objects, X and Y, move toward each other at different speeds on a horizontal surface with negligible friction, as shown in the top figure. The objects then collide elastically and move away from each other. The kinetic energy of object X as a function of time is shown in the graph. Which of the following is true of the speed <math alttext=\"v sub Y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>Y</mi></msub></math> of object Y?",
