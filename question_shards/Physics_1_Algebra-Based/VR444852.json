    "question": "Two identical spheres are attached to opposite ends of a thin rod of negligible mass, as shown in the figure. The spheres-rod system is thrown straight upward and is rotating counterclockwise as it moves through the air. Which of the following is correct about the angular momentum of the spheres-rod system while it is in the air? What is a valid justification?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The angular momentum remains constant because there is never a net torque acting on the system.",

      {
