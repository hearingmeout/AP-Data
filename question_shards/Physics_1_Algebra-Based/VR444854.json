    "question": "Block <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> slides rightward on the floor toward an ideal spring attached to block <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, as shown. At time <math alttext=\"t sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>, block <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> reaches the spring and starts compressing it as block <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> also starts to slide to the right. At a later time, <math alttext=\"t sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>, block <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> loses contact with the spring. Both blocks slide with negligible friction. Taking rightward as positive, which pair of graphs could represent the acceleration of block <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> and the center-of-mass acceleration of the two-block system?",

It then moves upward and to the right and reaches a peak at a point about halfway between t sub 1 and t sub 2, and then moves downward and to the right until it reaches the horizontal axis at the value t sub 2. It then moves horizontally to the right until it ends. In the second graph, the graph is a line that begins at the origin and moves horizontally to the right, passing through t sub 1 and t sub 2 before it ends.",
