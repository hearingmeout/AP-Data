    "question": "On a straight horizontal track along which blocks can slide with negligible friction, block 1 slides toward block 2, which is initially at rest. Block 1 collides with an electronic force probe attached to block 2, generating a force vs. time graph and causing block 2 to start sliding. What additional measurements must be made to determine the momentum of block 2 after the collision?",
