    "question": "A launcher with mass <math alttext=\"m sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> is suspended from the ceiling by a string, as shown. A block with mass <math alttext=\"m sub 2 is less than m sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>&lt;</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> is launched horizontally. At the moment of launch, the block has unknown speed <math alttext=\"v sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> and the launcher has unknown speed <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> in the opposite direction. Which of the following is a true statement about the forces exerted between the launcher and block?",
