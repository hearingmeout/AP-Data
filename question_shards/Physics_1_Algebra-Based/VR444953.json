The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Force.” The curve begins at the origin, then moves horizontally to the right at first. The curve then moves steeply upward and to the right, reaching a peak about halfway along the horizontal axis, near the top of the vertical axis. The curve then moves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches the horizontal axis, and continues moving horizontally to the right.",
