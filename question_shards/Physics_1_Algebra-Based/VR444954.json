    "question": "In Figure 1, cart Y is connected to cart X by a tight string and is also connected to the hanging block of mass <math alttext=\"m sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> by a light string that passes over a pulley. Figure 2 shows a system that is identical except for one change: cart Y and X are connected by a spring at its equilibrium length. Both systems are released from rest. Is the hanging block’s acceleration as a function of time the same in both systems, and why or why not?",
