    "question": "A platform is initially rotating on smooth ice with negligible friction, as shown at left in the figure. A stationary disk is dropped directly onto the center of the platform. A short time later, the disk and platform rotate together at the same angular velocity, as shown at right in the figure. How does the angular momentum of only the platform change, if at all, after the disk drops? What is a justification for your answer?",
