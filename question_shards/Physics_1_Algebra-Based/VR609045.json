The first solid horizontal line segment begins on the vertical axis, just below the origin, and extends to the right until it ends about halfway along the horizontal axis. The dashed vertical line segment begins where the first horizontal line segment ends, and extends upward, crosses the horizontal axis, and ends at a point that is about halfway between the horizontal axis and v sub t.
