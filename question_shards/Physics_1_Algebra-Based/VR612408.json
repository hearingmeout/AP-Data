    "question": "At time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, a car starts from rest and begins to drive along a straight, horizontal track. The graph shown represents the position of the car as a function of time squared. Which of the following statements correctly describes the motion of the car?",
