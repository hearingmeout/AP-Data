    "question": "A student is riding on a bus that is traveling east at a constant speed. The student walks toward the front of the bus. A stationary observer outside the bus standing on the road claims that the student is moving faster than the bus. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "No, because the student is included in the same frame of reference as the bus so the student and bus must be traveling at the same speed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the student, bus, and observer are all included in Earth’s reference frame so the student and bus must be traveling at the same speed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because according to the stationary observer, the student’s velocity is the velocity of the bus plus the velocity of the student relative to the bus.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because according to the stationary observer, the student’s velocity is the difference between the velocity of the bus and the velocity of the student relative to the bus.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because according to the stationary observer, the student’s velocity is the velocity of the bus plus the velocity of the student relative to the bus."
