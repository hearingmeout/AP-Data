    "question": "A rowboat moving in a lake is accelerating at a constant rate towards the shore. An observer in another boat moving at a constant velocity measures the row boat’s acceleration. A second observer, standing still on the shore, also measures the acceleration of the rowboat. Are the two accelerations measured by the two observers the same? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "No, because the observer on the other boat is in a non-inertial reference frame.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the observers have different velocities relative to the rowboat.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because both observers are in inertial reference frames.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because both observers are external to the rowboat’s frame of reference and will therefore measure zero acceleration.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because both observers are in inertial reference frames."
