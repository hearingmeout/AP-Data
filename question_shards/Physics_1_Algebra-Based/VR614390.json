    "question": "A toolbox is set on a rigid board that has negligible mass compared to the box. The frontmost part of the toolbox is Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and the backmost part of the toolbox is Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>. The board is set on a pivot that is located midway between points <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> and is held in place, as shown in the left figure. When the board is released, Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> lowers and Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> rises, as show in the right figure. Which of the following must be true about the toolbox?",
