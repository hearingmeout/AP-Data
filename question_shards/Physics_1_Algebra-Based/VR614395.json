    "question": "A block on a surface with negligible friction is held against a compressed, horizontal spring. The block is then released. Which of the following statements correctly describes the force exerted on the block and the motion of the block immediately after the block is released?",

      {
        "label": "The force exerted by the spring is increasing and the speed of the block is increasing.",
