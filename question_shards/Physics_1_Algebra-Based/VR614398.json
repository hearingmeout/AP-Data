    "question": "A rover attached by a cord to a parachute falls downward at constant speed near the surface of Mars. <math alttext=\"vector F sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>→</mo></mover></math> is the gravitational force exerted on the rover by Mars and <math alttext=\"vector F sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>→</mo></mover></math> is the tension force exerted on the rover by the cord. Are these two forces a Newton’s third law pair? Why or why not?",
