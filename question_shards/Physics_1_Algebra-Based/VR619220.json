    "question": "A block with mass <math alttext=\"1 kilogram\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>kg</mtext></math> rests on the left end of a board with negligible mass and a block with mass <math alttext=\"4 kilograms\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>kg</mtext></math> rests on the right end of the board, as shown. The board is placed on a fulcrum (not shown) so that the fulcrum is at the center of mass of the two-block system and the board balances in the horizontal position shown. A third block is then placed at the center of the board. In which direction, if any, must the fulcrum be moved so it will be at the center of mass of the three-block system?",
