    "question": "The left figure shows a block at rest on a rough inclined surface. The block is attached to a wall by a string of negligible mass. The vector sum of the forces is zero. The right figure shows the free-body diagram for the block. The string is cut and the vector sum of the forces on the block remains zero. Which of the following free-body diagrams could show the forces exerted on the block after the string is cut?",
