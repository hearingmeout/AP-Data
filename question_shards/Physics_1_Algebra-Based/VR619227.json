    "question": "A platform of mass <math alttext=\"m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>m</mi></math> is held at rest by two ropes connected to its ends, as shown in the diagram on the left. A block, also of mass <math alttext=\"m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>m</mi></math>, is placed on the center of the platform. A student draws a free-body diagram representing the forces exerted on the platform while it is at rest, as shown in the diagram on the right. Which of the following claims best explains why the diagram is incorrect?",
