    "question": "A hammer drives a nail into a piece of wood that is at rest. At the instant shown, the hammer is in contact with the nail and the nail is accelerating downward.

      {
        "label": "The magnitude of the force that the hammer exerts on the nail is equal to the magnitude of the force that the nail exerts on the hammer.",
