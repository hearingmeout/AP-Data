    "question": "A person standing on an escalator is not moving relative to the escalator steps. The escalator steps are moving up and to the right at constant velocity. Let the force that the escalator step exerts on the person’s feet be <math alttext=\"F sub feet\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>feet</mi></msub></math> and let the force that the person’s feet exert on the escalator step be <math alttext=\"F sub step\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>step</mi></msub></math>. Do these two forces have equal magnitude?",
