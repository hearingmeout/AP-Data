    "question": "At the instant shown, a paper airplane is moving horizontally to the right. The air exerts two independent forces on the plane: an upward lift force with magnitude less than the plane’s weight and a resistive drag force. Which of the following correctly describes the change in velocity, if any, of the plane in the horizontal and vertical directions at this instant?\nHorizontalVerticalANo changeNo changeBNo changeIncreasing downwardCDecreasingNo changeDDecreasingIncreasing downward",
