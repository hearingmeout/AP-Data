    "question": "Two applied forces are exerted on a box that slides along a flat surface with negligible friction. The force on the right is at an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> to the horizontal, as shown. The box is initially moving to the right at a constant velocity. The angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> is then slowly decreased, but the magnitudes of the applied forces remain constant. Which of the following correctly describes the motion of the box as the angle is decreased?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The velocity of the box remains constant because the sum of all the forces on the box remains constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The velocity of the box remains constant because the horizontal components of the forces do not change.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The velocity of the box changes because the sum of the vertical components of the forces no longer equals zero.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The velocity of the box changes because the sum of the horizontal components of the forces no longer equals zero.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The velocity of the box changes because the sum of the horizontal components of the forces no longer equals zero."
