    "question": "An astronaut jumps from the surface of the Moon and follows the path shown by the dashed line. At Point <math alttext=\"P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi></math>, the astronaut is at the highest point in the path. Air resistance is negligible. Is the astronaut in equilibrium? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the astronaut only has a constant horizontal velocity.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the astronaut’s vertical velocity is instantaneously zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the astronaut has a component of velocity in the horizontal direction.",
