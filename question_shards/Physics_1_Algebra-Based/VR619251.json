    "question": "At time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, a car is traveling on a straight, level road and the driver begins to apply the brakes. The car slows down and eventually stops at time <math alttext=\"t sub s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></math>. The magnitude of the acceleration of the car as a function of time is equal to <math alttext=\"C t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>C</mi><mi>t</mi></math>, where <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>C</mi></math> is a positive constant. Which of the following graphs could represent the magnitude <math alttext=\"F sub net\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>net</mi></msub></math> of the net force on the car as a function of time?",
