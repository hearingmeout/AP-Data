    "question": "A spacecraft in deep space fires its thruster, which ejects fuel from the spacecraft. The ejected fuel exerts a constant force on the spacecraft and the total mass of the spacecraft decreases at a constant rate. Which of the following graphs best represents the acceleration of the spacecraft as a function of time while the thruster is firing?",

The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Acceleration.” The curve begins at the origin and moves steeply upward and to the right, almost vertically, until it reaches a point high above the horizontal axis and just to the right of the vertical axis. From here, it begins to move very gradually upward and to the right until ends high above the horizontal axis and far to the right of the vertical axis.",
