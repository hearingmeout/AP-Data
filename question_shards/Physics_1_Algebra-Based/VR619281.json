    "question": "A weight is attached to a vertical spring that is fixed to a ceiling. The weight is held at rest at Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and then released. The weight falls downward, reaches its lowest position at Point <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">C</mi></math>, and then begins to move upward. The weight then bounces up and down several times and then eventually comes to rest at Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>. Which of the following statements about the motion of the weight must be true whenever the weight is between points <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">C</mi></math>?",
