    "question": "A block hangs at rest from a spring, stretching the spring to length <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>L</mi></math>, as shown in the left figure. The block is then completely submerged in a tank of water and comes to rest, as shown in the right figure. It is observed that, with the block in the water, the spring’s length is less than <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>L</mi></math>. Which of the following correctly indicates why the spring’s length decreases when the block is submerged?",
