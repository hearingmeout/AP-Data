    "question": "A sled slides along a vertical circular track of radius <math alttext=\"r\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>r</mi></math>, as shown. There is negligible friction between the sled and the track. At the bottommost point of the track, the sled has speed <math alttext=\"v sub b\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mtext>b</mtext></msub></math>. Which of the following graphs best show the normal force exerted by the track on the sled at the bottommost point of the track as a function of <math alttext=\"v sub b\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mtext>b</mtext></msub></math>?",
