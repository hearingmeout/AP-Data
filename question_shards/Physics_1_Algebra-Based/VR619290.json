    "question": "A cart is moving along a horizontal circular track. At the instant shown, the cart is moving to the right and its speed is increasing. A student claims that the net force on the cart is directed toward the center of the track. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the centripetal force always points toward the center of the circular motion.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the speed of the cart is increasing so there must be a nonzero net force.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the cart has both a tangential acceleration parallel to the track and a centripetal acceleration perpendicular to the track.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the speed is increasing and therefore the net force is directed to the right.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because the cart has both a tangential acceleration parallel to the track and a centripetal acceleration perpendicular to the track."
