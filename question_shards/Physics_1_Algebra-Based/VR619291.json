    "question": "A motor swings a ball on a string in a vertical circle such that the tension in the string is constant throughout the ball’s motion. Which of the following correctly indicates at which point the ball has the greatest speed and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "At the topmost point, because the tension force and gravitational force are both directed toward the center of the ball’s motion.",

      },
      {
        "label": "At the topmost point, because the net force on the ball is zero.",

    "answer": "At the topmost point, because the tension force and gravitational force are both directed toward the center of the ball’s motion."
