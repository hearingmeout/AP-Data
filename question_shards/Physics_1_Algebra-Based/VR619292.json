    "question": "One end of a string is held in place and the other end of the string is attached to a disk. The disk can be set in motion and travel in a circular path with constant speed along a horizontal surface. A force sensor with negligible mass is attached to the string, as shown in the figure. There is negligible friction between both the disk and force sensor and the surface. A student sketches the graph shown of the force measured by the force sensor for several values of the speed. Is the student’s sketch accurate? Why or why not?",

      {
        "label": "No, because the force would decrease as speed increases.",
