    "question": "A spaceship is moving in a straight line with velocity <math alttext=\"vector v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover><mi>v</mi><mo>→</mo></mover></math>. The spaceship has an acceleration that is directed opposite to the direction of the velocity. Which of the following statements about the change in the kinetic energy of the spaceship is correct?",
