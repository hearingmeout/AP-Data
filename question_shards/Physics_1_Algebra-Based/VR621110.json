    "question": "Two blocks on a horizontal surface are connected by a spring, as shown. A rope pulls one of the blocks with a constant force and both blocks have the same acceleration to the right. Is the spring potential energy zero? Why or why not?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because both blocks are moving with the same acceleration and therefore the spring is unstretched.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the spring potential energy has been converted to the kinetic energy of the blocks.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because even though the spring is unstretched it is moving and therefore has energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the spring must be exerting a force on the left block and therefore must be stretched beyond its equilibrium length.",

    "answer": "No, because the spring must be exerting a force on the left block and therefore must be stretched beyond its equilibrium length."
