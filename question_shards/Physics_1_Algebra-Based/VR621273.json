    "question": "An acrobat is initially hanging from a bar over a platform of negligible mass that is attached to a spring, as shown. The acrobat then releases the bar and falls to the platform. When the acrobat lands on the platform, the platform and acrobat continue moving downward until they momentarily come to rest when the spring is compressed a maximum distance. Consider the system consisting of the acrobat and the spring. Which of the following correctly indicates the moment when the acrobat-spring system has the largest total mechanical energy, and provides a valid justification?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Immediately after the acrobat releases the bar, because the acrobat is the greatest distance above the lowest point of motion and has the greatest amount of gravitational potential energy",

      {
        "label": "Immediately after the acrobat releases the bar because the spring is at its maximum length",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "When the acrobat and platform come to rest, because the acrobat has fallen the maximum amount and all the work done by gravity on the acrobat has been converted to potential energy in the spring",

        "label": "When the acrobat and platform come to rest, because the spring has transferred all of its energy to the acrobat",
