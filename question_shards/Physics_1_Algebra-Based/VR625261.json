    "description": "",
    "question": "A puck is sliding with constant speed across a smooth, horizontal surface with negligible friction. The puck then reaches a rough, horizontal section with non-negligible friction. A student claims that the translational kinetic energy of the object will be increasing when it is sliding on the rough section. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the claim is correct and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "It is correct, because the frictional force accelerates the puck, causing its speed to increase.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is correct, because the kinetic energy is always a positive scalar quantity.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is not correct, because the frictional force accelerates the puck, causing its speed to decrease.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is not correct, because the puck is moving at a constant velocity.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "It is not correct, because the frictional force accelerates the puck, causing its speed to decrease."
