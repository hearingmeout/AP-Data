    "question": "In an experiment, a horizontal force is exerted on a cart as it moves along a straight, horizontal track with negligible friction. Several trials are performed, and in each trial the total work done on the cart is the same, but the magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> of the applied force and the distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> that the cart is pushed are varied. Which of the following graphs best represents how <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> depends on <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math>?",
