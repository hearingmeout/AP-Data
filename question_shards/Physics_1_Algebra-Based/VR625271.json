    "question": "One end of a rod of negligible mass is attached to a block and the other end is attached to a pivot. Initially, the block is held in place with the rod horizontal. The block is then released and swings down through its lowest point, as shown, before swinging back up again. Frictional forces are negligible. Which of the following statements correctly indicate the work done on the block while it is swinging down?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Work is done only by the tension force from the rod.",
