    "question": "An object is released from rest near the surface of Earth. Initially, the object accelerates as it begins to fall towards the Earth’s surface. Earth’s atmosphere exerts a resistive force on the object, and it reaches a terminal velocity before landing. Which of the following claims about the gravitational potential energy of the object-Earth system is true?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy remains constant during the initial acceleration period but then decreases as the object falls at terminal velocity.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy decreases during the initial acceleration period but then remains constant as the object falls at terminal velocity.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy remains constant both during the initial acceleration period and as the object falls at terminal velocity.",
