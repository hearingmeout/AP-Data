    "question": "A skydiver with an open parachute falls toward the ground at a constant speed. Is the mechanical energy of the skydiver-Earth system constant as the skydiver descends? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the kinetic energy of the skydiver remains constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the net force on the skydiver-Earth system is zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the potential energy of the system decreases, and the kinetic energy of the skydiver remains constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the kinetic energy of the skydiver increases, and the potential energy of the system remains constant.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because the potential energy of the system decreases, and the kinetic energy of the skydiver remains constant."
