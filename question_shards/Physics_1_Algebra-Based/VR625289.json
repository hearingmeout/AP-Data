    "question": "A block slides to the right across a rough horizontal surface. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the mechanical energy of the block-Earth system decreases or stays the same as the block slides, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy decreases because energy is dissipated by the external force of friction.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy decreases because kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy remains constant because the block remains at the same vertical position throughout.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mechanical energy remains constant because energy is always conserved.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The mechanical energy decreases because energy is dissipated by the external force of friction."
