    "question": "A block is released from rest at the top of a rough ramp. There is significant friction between the block and the ramp, but the block’s speed increases as the block slides down the ramp. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the total mechanical energy of the block-Earth system decreases or remains the same, and provides a valid justification?",
