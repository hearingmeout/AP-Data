    "question": "Two crates are at rest on a flat surface. A student exerts a continuous force of magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> on the first crate that causes the crate to accelerate over a distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> in time <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math>. The second crate is accelerated by the same continuous force of magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> over the same distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math>, but in half the time. The student claims that the same average power is delivered to both crates by the force. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the force exerted on each crate is the same.",

      {
        "label": "Yes, because the work done on each crate is the same.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the time the force was applied to each crate is different.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the mass of each crate is different.",

    "answer": "No, because the time the force was applied to each crate is different."
