    "question": "A block is pushed up a ramp at a constant speed <math alttext=\"v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>v</mi></math>. A second block of equal mass is pushed up a second, steeper ramp at the same constant speed <math alttext=\"v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>v</mi></math>. Frictional forces between the blocks and the ramps are negligible. Why is the instantaneous power delivered to the block on the steeper ramp greater than the instantaneous power delivered to the block on the less steep ramp?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Because the component of gravity parallel to the ramp is greater on the steeper ramp",
