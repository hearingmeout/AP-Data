    "question": "In a controlled experiment, a small explosive device is placed inside of a cart that is designed to break apart easily. The device is activated and the cart splits evenly into two pieces of equal mass that move away from each other at equal constant speeds. Which of the following correctly indicates a model that could be used to describe the interactions involved in this scenario?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The device is external to the system and exerts a constant force on the two pieces as they move away from each other.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pieces of the cart are exerting constant repulsive forces on each other as they move away.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The device is internal to the system and exerts a very brief force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on each piece of the cart.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The device is internal to the system and therefore does not exert any forces on the pieces of the cart.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The device is internal to the system and exerts a very brief force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on each piece of the cart."
