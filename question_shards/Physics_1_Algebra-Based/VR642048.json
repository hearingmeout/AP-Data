    "question": "The graph represents the force exerted by a barrier on a ball as the ball collides with and bounces off the barrier. The initial and final velocities of the ball have the same magnitude <math alttext=\"v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>v</mi></math> but opposite directions. Which of the following graphs could represent the force exerted on the ball if the initial and final speeds of the ball were <math alttext=\"2 v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mi>v</mi></math> but the contact time remained the same?",
