    "question": "Ball <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and Ball <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> have the same mass. Each is dropped from a height of <math alttext=\"1.0 meter\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1.0</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></math> onto a platform scale. Ball <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> bounces off the scale, leaving the scale with nearly the same speed it had immediately before contacting the scale. Ball <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> barely bounces at all, leaving the scale with an almost negligible speed. Both balls are in contact with the scale for the same time interval during the collision. Which of the following correctly identifies which ball, if either, caused the scale the read a larger average force during the collision and provides valid justification?",
