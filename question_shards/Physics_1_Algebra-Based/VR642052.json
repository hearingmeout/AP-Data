    "question": "A brick is dropped from the top of a building and falls toward the ground. In Case <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math>, the brick lands on concrete and breaks into many pieces. In Case <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>, the brick lands on a thin foam pad and does not break. Why does the brick not break in Case <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> but breaks in Case <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math>?",
