    "question": "A spring-loaded launcher cart is initially at rest on a horizontal surface, as shown. When the launching mechanism is released, a marble leaves the launcher with speed <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mstyle></math> and the cart moves in the opposite direction with speed <math alttext=\"v sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mstyle></math>. Frictional forces are negligible. Is the momentum of the launcher-marble system before the launch equal to the momentum immediately after the launch? Why or why not?",
