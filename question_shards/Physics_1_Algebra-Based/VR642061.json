    "question": "A student throws a small lump of clay directly upward. The student then swings a heavy rod at the clay and, at the instant the clay comes to rest at its maximum height, the rod collides with the clay. The clay immediately sticks to the rod. Which of the following correctly indicates which object, if either, experiences an impulse of greater magnitude because of the collision, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The clay, because the rod is more massive and therefore delivers more impulse to the clay than the clay delvers to the rod.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The clay, because the speed of the clay increases more than the speed of the rod decreases.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Neither, because the clay and the rod have equal and opposite accelerations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Neither, because the change in momentum of the clay is equal and opposite to that of the rod.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Neither, because the change in momentum of the clay is equal and opposite to that of the rod."
