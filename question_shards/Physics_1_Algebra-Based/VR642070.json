    "question": "A ball of clay is thrown at and sticks to a target mounted on the back of a cart that is at rest. After the collision, the cart and clay move together. Which of the following correctly describes the kinetic energy of the clay-cart system following the collision?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The kinetic energy is greater than that of the clay just before the collision.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The kinetic energy is less than that of the clay just before the collision.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The kinetic energy is equal to that of the clay just before the collision.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The kinetic energy cannot be determined without knowing if the cart has greater or less mass than the clay.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The kinetic energy is less than that of the clay just before the collision."
