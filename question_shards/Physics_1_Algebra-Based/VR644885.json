    "question": "At time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, a wheel is rotating in the counterclockwise (positive) direction. A brake is applied to the wheel, exerting a nonconstant friction force on the wheel. The angular acceleration <math alttext=\"alpha\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>α</mi></math> of the wheel as a function of time for the interval of time <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> when the brake is applied is represented in the graph. Which of the following graphs could represent the angular speed <math alttext=\"omega\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ω</mi></math> as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> for the wheel during this same interval?",
