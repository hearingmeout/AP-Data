    "question": "A spherical cloud of gas and dust in deep space is far from any other objects when it begins to collapse. The radius of the cloud decreases over time. Which of the following correctly indicates how the rotational inertia of the cloud about its center changes, if at all, as it collapses?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The rotational inertia will decrease.",
