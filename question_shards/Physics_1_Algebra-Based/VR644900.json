    "question": "In addition to the force from the pivot, at the instant shown in the top-view figure a horizontal rod has four forces exerted on it with the magnitudes and locations indicated. The rod is free to rotate about a pivot at its right end. A student claims that the rod is in rotational equilibrium. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the sum of the forces exerted on the object is equal to zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the sum of the torques exerted on the object is equal to zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because sum of the clockwise torques is greater than the sum of the counterclockwise torques.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the forces are not all exerted at the same distance from the rotational axis.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because sum of the clockwise torques is greater than the sum of the counterclockwise torques."
