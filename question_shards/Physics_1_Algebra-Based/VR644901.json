    "question": "A block of mass <math alttext=\"m sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> hangs from a string that passes over a pulley and is wrapped around a horizontal disk of radius <math alttext=\"R sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>, as shown in the diagram. The masses of the string and the pulley are negligible. The block is released from rest and begins moving downward. Does the string exert a torque on the disk, about the center of the disk, equal to <math alttext=\"m sub 0 g R sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mi>g</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> ? Why or why not?",
