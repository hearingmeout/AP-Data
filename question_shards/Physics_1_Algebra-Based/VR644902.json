    "question": "An engineer tightens a bolt with a wrench. The engineer exerts a force of magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> near the middle of the wrench at an angle <math alttext=\"phi\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ϕ</mi></math> to the normal, as shown. A student claims that to increase the torque exerted on the bolt by the wrench, the engineer could decrease the angle <math alttext=\"phi\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ϕ</mi></math> between the force and the normal. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?",
