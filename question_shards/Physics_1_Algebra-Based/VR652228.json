    "question": "The graph shows the angular velocity of a rotating wheel as a function of time. A student analyzing the graph claims that the wheel has a constant angular acceleration. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the area under the graph is positive.",

      {
        "label": "Yes, because the graph is linear.",

      {
        "label": "No, because the graph is not a horizontal line.",
