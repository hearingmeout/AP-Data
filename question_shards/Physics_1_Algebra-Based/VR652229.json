    "question": "A disk is initially rotating at a constant angular velocity in the counterclockwise direction about an axle where friction is negligible. The disk then begins to accelerate at a constant rate in the clockwise direction until the disk’s angular velocity is half its original value. Which of the following statements best describes why the angular displacement continued to increase in the counterclockwise direction even though angular acceleration was in the clockwise direction?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Angular displacement is always opposite the direction of angular acceleration.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Angular displacement is independent of the angular acceleration.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The angular velocity continued to be in the counterclockwise direction.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The magnitude of the angular acceleration was less than the magnitude of the angular velocity.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The angular velocity continued to be in the counterclockwise direction."
