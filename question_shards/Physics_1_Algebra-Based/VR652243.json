    "question": "A rod is free to rotate on a horizontal surface about a pivot at its left end, as shown. Frictional forces are negligible. A force of magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> is exerted at the midpoint of the rod at an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math>, where initially <math alttext=\"theta equals 45 degrees\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>45</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">°</mi></mstyle></math>. If the angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> is increased while keeping the location and magnitude of the force constant, which of the following graphs would correctly represent the torque exerted by the force as a function of <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> as it is increased from <math alttext=\"45 degrees\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mn>45</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">°</mi></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"90 degrees\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mn>90</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">°</mi></mstyle></math>?",
