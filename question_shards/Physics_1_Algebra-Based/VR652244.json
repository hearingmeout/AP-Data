    "question": "An engineer constructs a hexagonal platform that is free to rotate with negligible friction about its center on a horizontal surface. The engineer attaches two fans on opposite edges of the platform, as shown, that exert forces on the platform in the directions indicated in the figure. The magnitude of <math alttext=\"F sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mstyle></math> is constant, but the magnitude of <math alttext=\"F sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mstyle></math> can vary with time. In one scenario, <math alttext=\"F sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mstyle></math> is initially equal in magnitude to <math alttext=\"F sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mstyle></math> and then slowly increases to <math alttext=\"2 F sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mi>F</mi></mstyle><mn>0</mn></msub></mstyle></math>. Which of the following graphs could represent the magnitude of the net torque, <math alttext=\"tau sub net\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>τ</mi><mtext>net</mtext></msub></math>, exerted on the platform as a function of <math alttext=\"F sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mstyle></math> in this scenario?",
