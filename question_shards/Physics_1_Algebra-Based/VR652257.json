    "question": "A cylindrical rod is attached to a disk, as shown. The mass of the rod is equal to the mass of the disk and both the rod and disk have uniform density. The rod-disk system rotates about the dashed axis shown, which goes through the center of mass of the system. Which of the following claims about the rotational inertia of the system is true?",
