    "question": "A disk is initially at rest on a tabletop when four forces, all with the same magnitude, are briefly exerted on the disk at the locations and in the directions shown in the top-view diagram. There is negligible friction between the disk and the tabletop. Which of the following correctly describes the motion of the disk immediately after the forces have been exerted?",
