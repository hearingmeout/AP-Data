    "question": "A uniform metal pole is fixed to an axle at its center and has two blocks attached to it. Each block is free to slide along the pole and the blocks are initially placed as shown in the diagram. A string is wrapped around the axle and connected over a pulley to a motor, as shown. The motor pulls the string downward, causing the axle and the pole to rotate. As the pole rotates, the blocks begin to slide apart toward the ends of the pole. There is negligible friction between the blocks and the pole. As the blocks are sliding, the angular acceleration of the axle and pole is constant. Which of the following correctly describes how the magnitude of the force exerted by the motor on the string changes, if at all, as the blocks slide apart?",
