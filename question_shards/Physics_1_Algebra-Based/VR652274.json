    "question": "A disk is free to rotate about an axle at the disk’s center. A force of magnitude <math alttext=\"F \" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> is exerted tangentially at the edge of the disk, as shown in the left figure, and the disk has angular acceleration <math alttext=\"alpha\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>α</mi></math>. The disk is returned to rest and a second identical disk is placed on top of the first disk, as shown in the middle figure. The disks move together and do not slip. A force with magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> is again exerted tangentially at the edge of the first disk, as shown in the right figure. A student claims that the angular acceleration will again be <math alttext=\"alpha\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>α</mi></math> when the force of magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>F</mi></math> is exerted on the two-disk system. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
