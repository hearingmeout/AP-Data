    "question": "A uniform bar is initially at rest on a horizontal surface when the two forces indicated in the top-view figure are exerted at the ends of the rod. The bar is free to rotate about a fixed a pivot at the bar’s center that anchors the center of the bar to the horizontal surface. Friction forces are negligible. As indicated by the arrows in the figure, <math alttext=\"F sub 1 is greater than F sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>. A student claims that at the instant shown in the figure the pivot is exerting a nonzero force on the bar and exerting a nonzero torque on the bar about the pivot. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the forces and torques are unbalanced. Therefore, the pivot must balance the forces and torques.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the pivot will act to prevent the rotation and sliding of the bar.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because while the pivot does exert a nonzero force on the bar to balance the applied forces, the pivot exerts no torque because the force is applied at the axis of rotation.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because frictional forces are negligible, and therefore the bar slides freely on the pivot and the pivot exerts no force or torque on the bar.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because while the pivot does exert a nonzero force on the bar to balance the applied forces, the pivot exerts no torque because the force is applied at the axis of rotation."
