    "question": "One end of a string is wrapped around a pulley that is free to rotate with negligible friction about an axle at its center. The other end of the string is attached to a block. The block is released from rest and moves downward with constant acceleration. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the amount of work done on the pulley by the string during each successive complete rotation remains constant or increases, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Remains constant, because the torque exerted by the string on the pulley is constant",
