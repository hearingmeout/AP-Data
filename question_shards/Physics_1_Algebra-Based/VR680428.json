    "question": "A child is standing near the edge of a rotating platform, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. The child-platform system is freely rotating with negligible friction around a central axle. The child then slowly walks directly to the center of the platform, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. Which of the following correctly states the change, if any, of the angular speed of the platform as the child walks to the center of the platform?",
