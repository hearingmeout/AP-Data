    "question": "A cylinder and a block have equal masses and are both released from rest at the top of identically shaped ramps, as shown. The cylinder rolls without slipping, while the block slides down the ramp with negligible friction. Which of the following correctly states whether the block or cylinder, if either, has a greater translational speed upon reaching the bottom of the ramp, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The block has a greater translational speed because all of the work done on the block by gravity is converted to translational kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The block has a greater translational speed because neither object experiences a friction force, giving both the block and the cylinder the same acceleration.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The cylinder and the block have the same translational speed because the work done by gravity on both the block and the cylinder is the same.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The cylinder and the block have the same translational speed because the normal force exerted on both the block and the cylinder is the same.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The block has a greater translational speed because all of the work done on the block by gravity is converted to translational kinetic energy."
