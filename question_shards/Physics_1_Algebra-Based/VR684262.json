    "question": "An asteroid is moving through deep space far from any other objects. The linear velocity of the center of mass of the asteroid is constant and the asteroid is rotating about its center of mass with constant angular velocity. Which of the following statements correctly describe the rotational and translational kinetic energy of the asteroid?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy must be less than the translational kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy must be equal to the translational kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy must be greater than the translational kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy can be less than, equal to, or greater than the translational kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The rotational kinetic energy can be less than, equal to, or greater than the translational kinetic energy."
