    "question": "In an experiment, a puck slides toward the end of a rod that is free to rotate on a horizontal surface about a pivot at its left end, as shown in the top view figure. In each trial, the puck slides with constant speed <math alttext=\"v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>v</mi></math> but the angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> between the velocity vector and the rod is varied. The angular momentum <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>L</mi></math> of the puck about the pivot immediately before the puck reaches the rod is calculated. Which of the following graphs could show <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>L</mi></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> ?",
