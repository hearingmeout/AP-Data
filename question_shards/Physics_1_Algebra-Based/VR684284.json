    "question": "A horizontal platform with rotational inertia <math alttext=\"I sub p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi></msub></math> is spinning about a central axis with negligible friction, as shown. A ball of clay with rotational inertia about its center <math alttext=\"I sub c\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi></msub></math>, where <math alttext=\"I sub c is less than I sub p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi></msub><mo>&lt;</mo><msub><mi>I</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi></msub></math>, is dropped onto, and sticks to, the center of the platform. Which of the following claims about the magnitude of the angular impulse exerted on the platform by the clay is true?",
