    "description": "A rod rotates on a horizontal surface about a pivot at its center with negligible friction, as shown in the top view figure. The rod collides with and sticks to a disk that is at rest on the surface and the objects rotate together. Which of the following correctly indicates how the rotational inertia of the rod-disk system and the angular speed of the rod change, if at all, as a result of the collision?",
