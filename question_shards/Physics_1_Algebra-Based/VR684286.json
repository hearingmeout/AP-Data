    "question": "A puck slides toward the right with a constant velocity across a smooth surface toward a bar that is free to rotate about a pivot at one end, as shown in the top view figure. The puck collides with and sticks to the bar, and the puck and bar rotate together about the bar’s pivot. Which of the following statements correctly describes the change in angular momentum of the puck and the bar about the pivot during the collision?",
