    "question": "In the setup shown, a hollow plastic pipe can spin with negligible friction on an axle at the center of the pipe, as shown. Two solid cylinders are placed inside the pipe at the locations shown. The pipe is given an initial angular speed, and the pipe-cylinders system rotates about the axle. As the system rotates, the cylinders slide toward the ends of the pipe. Which of the following correctly indicates how the angular speed of the system changes, if at all, as the cylinders slide and provides a valid justification?",
