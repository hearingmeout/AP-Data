    "question": "A student sits on a platform that can rotate with negligible friction. The student holds weights out with extended arms and the teacher gives the student a push to cause the student to begin spinning on the platform with constant angular velocity. While spinning, the student pulls the weights in toward the student’s body. Which of the following correctly describes how the angular momentum of the student‑weights system changes, if at all, when the weights are pulled in and provides a valid justification?",
