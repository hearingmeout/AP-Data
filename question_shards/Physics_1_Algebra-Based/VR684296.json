    "question": "A block and a hoop, both having the same mass, are released from rest at equal heights <math alttext=\"H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>H</mi></math> above the floor on identical rough tracks, as shown. Both objects move down the track, with the block sliding and the hoop rolling without slipping. Each object then moves up a short, curved ramp and is launched vertically upward. Each object’s center of mass comes to rest momentarily at a height <math alttext=\"The fraction H over 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>H</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> above the floor. A student claims that the total mechanical energies of the block-Earth system and the hoop-Earth system are equal when the centers of mass of the objects are momentarily at rest at height <math alttext=\"The fraction H over 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>H</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math>. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?",
