    "question": "A satellite is in an elliptical orbit around Earth. The energy bar chart represents the relative kinetic energy <math alttext=\"K\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>K</mi></math> of the satellite and the gravitational potential energy <math alttext=\"U\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>U</mi></math> of the satellite-Earth system when the satellite is a distance <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math> from the center of Earth. At a later time, the satellite is a distance greater than <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math> from the center of Earth. Which of the following bar graphs could represent the values of <math alttext=\"K\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>K</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"U\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>U</mi></math> at this later time?",
