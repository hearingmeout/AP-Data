    "question": "A block is attached to one end of a horizontal spring. The block is displaced by a distance <math alttext=\"delta x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>x</mi></math> from equilibrium, and when the block is released, it oscillates in simple harmonic motion with period <math alttext=\"T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>T</mi></math>. If the block is displaced by a distance <math alttext=\"2 delta x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>x</mi></math>, it will also oscillate in simple harmonic motion with period <math alttext=\"T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>T</mi></math>. Why does the period not increase when the initial displacement increases?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Because the equilibrium position will change when the initial displacement changes such that the block oscillates with the same amplitude and the same average speed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because the spring constant of the spring decreases with increasing displacement, which makes the block move with greater average speed when it is displaced more.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because the spring exerts the same force on the block at the maximum displacement of the block, in both scenarios.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because even though the block travels a larger distance during one oscillation when the initial displacement is greater, the average speed also increases by the same factor.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Because even though the block travels a larger distance during one oscillation when the initial displacement is greater, the average speed also increases by the same factor."
