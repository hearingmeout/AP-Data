    "question": "A block is released from rest on a track that consists of two ramps that are at the same small angle to the horizontal, as shown. The block makes a smooth transition from one ramp to another, and friction between the block and the track is negligible. The block slides back and forth along the track. Will the block undergo simple harmonic motion? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the motion of the block is periodic.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the restoring force exerted by the component of the gravitational force parallel to the ramp is always opposite the direction of the displacement of the block from equilibrium.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the average net force on the block over one complete oscillation is zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the restoring force exerted by the component of the gravitational force parallel to the ramp is not proportional to the block’s displacement from equilibrium.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because the restoring force exerted by the component of the gravitational force parallel to the ramp is not proportional to the block’s displacement from equilibrium."
