The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in seconds,” and the numbers 0.2 to 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Position, in centimeters,” and the numbers negative 25 through 25, in increments of 5, are indicated. The curve is a sinusoidal wave pattern that starts on the vertical axis at 20 and moves downward and to the right to a point with approximate coordinates of 0.5 comma negative 20, then moves upward and to the right, ending at a point with approximate coordinates of 1.0 comma 20.",
