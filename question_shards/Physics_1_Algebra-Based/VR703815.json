    "description": "A block on a horizontal surface is attached to one end of a horizontal spring, as shown in the figure. The other end of the spring is attached to a wall. There is negligible friction between the block and the surface. A student pulls back and releases the block from various positions and records the amplitude and maximum speed of the block.",

Which of the following graphs best represents the expected shape of the graph?",
