    "description": "A block on a horizontal surface is attached to one end of a horizontal spring, as shown in the figure. The other end of the spring is attached to a wall. There is negligible friction between the block and the surface. A student pulls back and releases the block from various positions and records the amplitude and maximum speed of the block.",
