    "question": "A student observes a block attached to a spring undergo simple harmonic motion. The student claims that a block with a smaller mass attached to the same spring and oscillating with a smaller amplitude could have the same maximum kinetic energy as the original block. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the less massive block will have a greater average speed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because even though the magnitude of the average force exerted on the block decreases, the less massive block requires less force to achieve the same acceleration.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the less massive block will have less kinetic energy as the original block no matter what the amplitude is.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because changing the amplitude of the oscillation changes the initial potential energy, which is equal to the maximum kinetic energy of the block.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because changing the amplitude of the oscillation changes the initial potential energy, which is equal to the maximum kinetic energy of the block."
