    "question": "A block is attached to a horizontal spring and undergoes simple harmonic motion along a horizontal surface. The two free-body diagrams, shown in the figure, represent the object at two different positions. Which of the following correctly indicates which of the two positions could be the equilibrium location, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Location <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, because the spring is exerting an upward force that counteracts gravity.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Location <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, because equilibrium position is a location at which the net force is zero.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Location <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, because the spring exerts a force opposite to the block’s displacement from equilibrium.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Location <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, because the horizontal force exerted by the spring is equal in magnitude to the weight of the block.",
