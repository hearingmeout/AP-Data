    "question": "The figure shows a graph of acceleration <math alttext=\"a sub x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></math> as a function of position <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math> for an object moving along the <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math>-axis. Is the graph shown consistent with simple harmonic motion? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the magnitude of the acceleration is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and its direction is opposite that of the displacement.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the graph is linear and passes through the origin.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the acceleration is negative when the displacement from equilibrium is positive, and positive when the displacement is negative.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the acceleration is always decreasing with increasing position.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because the magnitude of the acceleration is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and its direction is opposite that of the displacement."
