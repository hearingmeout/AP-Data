    "question": "A cart is attached to a horizontal spring and pulled back from its equilibrium position, which is indicated by the dashed line, to Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math>, as shown. When the cart is released from rest, it moves through Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>, then continues to undergo simple harmonic motion. If, instead of being released from rest, the cart is given a push to the left at Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math>, which of the following claims about the motion of the cart is correct?",
