    "question": "During an experiment, a flexible spherical balloon containing air is compressed. During the compression, the volume of the balloon decreases, but the balloon maintains its spherical shape and the number of gas atoms inside the balloon is constant. Which of the following correctly indicates how the density of the gas changes, if at all, as it is compressed?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The density of the gas will remain the same because the same amount of gas is in the balloon.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The density of the gas will remain the same because the shape of the balloon does not change.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The density of the gas will increase because the mass of the gas is constant and the volume of the balloon decreases.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The density of the gas will increase because the mass of the gas increases.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The density of the gas will increase because the mass of the gas is constant and the volume of the balloon decreases."
