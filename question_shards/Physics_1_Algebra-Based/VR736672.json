    "question": "Two small cylinders have the same height <math alttext=\"h\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>h</mi></math> but different diameters. The diameters of cylinders <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> are <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"2 d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mi>d</mi></math>, respectively. The cylinders are resting on a flat surface at the bottom of a pool, as shown in the figure. A student claims the force exerted by the water on the top surface each cylinder is the same. Which of the following indicates whether the claim is correct and provides a valid justification?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The claim is correct, because the pressure on the top surface of each cylinder is the same.",

      {

      {
        "label": "The claim is incorrect, because the pressure at the surface of each cylinder is the same but the area of the top surface of each cylinder is different.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is incorrect, because Cylinder <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> has a smaller surface area so the pressure at the top surface of Cylinder <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> is greater than the pressure at the top surface of Cylinder <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>.",
