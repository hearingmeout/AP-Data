    "question": "A student designs an experiment to determine the density of an unknown fluid. The student pours the fluid into a graduated cylinder and attaches an object to a force probe. The object has a density greater than the density of the fluid. The student partially submerges the object into the fluid and records both the volume of fluid displaced in the graduated cylinder and the force probe reading. The student then submerges the object further and remeasures both values, repeating the trials until the object is fully submerged, and creates a graph of the reading on the force probe as a function of volume of fluid displaced. Which of the following statements correctly describes how a feature of the graph is related to the density of the fluid?",
