    "question": "A container, which is open at the top, is filled to a height <math alttext=\"H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>H</mi></math> with water. A small hole is located near the bottom of the container. Water flows from the hole and lands on the floor a horizontal distance <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>D</mi></math> from the container as shown in the figure. Which of the following claims about the distance the water lands from the container is correct?",
