    "question": "An object slides down an incline where there is friction between the object and incline, but negligible air resistance. Which of the following must be true about the resulting changes in the kinetic energy of the object and the gravitational potential energy of the object-Earth system?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The sum of the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy changes by an amount equal to the energy dissipated by friction.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy decreases and the kinetic energy is constant.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The decrease in the gravitational potential energy is equal to the increase in kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy and the kinetic energy must both decrease.",
        "image": null
      }

    "answer": "The sum of the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy changes by an amount equal to the energy dissipated by friction."
