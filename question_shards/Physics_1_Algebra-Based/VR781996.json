    "description": "A horizontal platform is initially rotating about a vertical axis as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. A stationary disk is dropped directly onto the center of the platform. A short time later, the disk and platform rotate together without slipping, as shown in Figure 2.",
    "question": "How does the angular momentum of only the platform change, if at all, after the disk drops? What is a justification for your answer?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The angular momentum of the platform decreases. The top disk exerts a torque on the platform.",
