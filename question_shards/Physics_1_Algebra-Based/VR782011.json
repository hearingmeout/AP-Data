The container is filled to a height <math alttext=\"uppercase D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>D</mi></math>, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. A release valve is opened at a height <math alttext=\"lowercase d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> above the floor, and water exits horizontally from the valve, and initially hits the floor a distance <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math> from the side of the container. Assume the water in the container is still. The effects of friction, turbulence, and viscosity are negligible.",
