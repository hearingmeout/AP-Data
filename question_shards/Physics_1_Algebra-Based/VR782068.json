The manufacturer of the glider/track claims that when the track is turned on, friction between the glider and track is negligible.

        "text": "After performing their procedure, the students conclude that the force of friction between the track and the glider is negligible. In a second experiment, the students are tasked with calculating the mass of a hanger using the glider and track. The students tie the hanger to the glider with a string and place the string over a pulley. The students add six <math alttext=\"300 grams\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>300</mn><mspace width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mi></math> washers to their hanger. The masses of the string and the pulley are negligible compared to the total mass of the washers, hanger, and glider. The students release the glider – hanger – washer system and measure the acceleration of the glider with a motion sensor. In each of the following trials, the students move one washer from the hanger to the glider and repeat the experiment. The students correctly derive the following relationship between the mass <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>M</mi></math> of the glider with washers, the acceleration <math alttext=\"a\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>a</mi></math> of the system, and the total mass <math alttext=\"c\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>C</mi></math> of the glider – hanger – washer system: <math alttext=\"capital M equals capital C minus the fraction with numerator c times a and denominator g\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>a</mi></mrow><mi>g</mi></mfrac></math> The data collected by the students is shown in the table.
