The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nA group of students are given a cylindrical container half filled with a liquid of unknown density <math alttext=\"rho\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ρ</mi></math>. The students have access to an additional container with more of the same liquid, meter sticks, and a pressure sensor. They do not have access to a scale.\n\n(a) The students are asked to take measurements to create a graph that could be used to determine the density of the liquid. Describe an experimental procedure the students could use to collect the data needed to determine the density of the liquid. Include any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty. If needed, you may include a simple diagram of the setup with your procedure.",
