    "description": "Two systems are in oscillation: a simple pendulum consisting of a sphere on a long string that swings through a very small angle, and a block oscillating on a spring. The block-spring system takes twice as much time as the sphere-string system to complete one oscillation.",
    "question": "Which of the following changes could make the two systems oscillate with the same period?",
