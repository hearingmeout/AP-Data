    "description": "Blocks <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> slide toward each other on a horizontal track, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mn>1</mn> </math>. There is negligible friction between the blocks and the track. Figure <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> shows a momentum bar chart that represents the magnitude and direction of the momentum of each block before they collide.",
