The vertical axis is labeled Kinetic Energy and has no values along it. The horizontal axis is labeled Time and has the values T and 2 T indicated. The curve begins at the top of the vertical axis and moves down, crossing the horizontal axis at T over 4, reaching the first trough at T over 2, then going back up, crossing the horizontal axis at 3 T over 4 and reaching the full peak at T. The pattern repeats with crossings of the horizontal axis at 5 T over 4 and 7 T over 4 and a trough at 3 T over 2, reaching a new peak at 2 T. The peaks and troughs are the same distance from the horizontal axis.",
