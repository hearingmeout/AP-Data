    "description": "A tall cylinder filled with water is open to the atmosphere at the upper surface. A small opening near the bottom of the cylinder allows the water to flow out of the cylinder in a narrow stream, as shown in the figure. Students perform an experiment to determine the relationship between the horizontal distance <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math> the water travels before reaching the table and the vertical distance <math alttext=\"h\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>h</mi> </math> between the hole and the surface of the water.",
    "question": "Which of the following graphs represents the correct relationship between <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>x</mi> </math> and <math alttext=\"h\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>h</mi> </math>?",
