    "description": "A block, initially at rest on a horizontal track, is compressed against a spring as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. The block is released from rest, slides across the horizontal track and then up a curved ramp, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mn>2</mn> </math>. Frictional forces are negligible. The block momentarily comes to rest near the top of the ramp. Consider the block, spring, and Earth as a single system.",
    "question": "Which of the following explains why the block comes to rest while on the ramp?",
