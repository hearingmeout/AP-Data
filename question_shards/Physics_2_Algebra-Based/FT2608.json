    "question": "Statements that are true for a stationary charged point particle include which of the following?\nI. The electric field created by the charge at any single point is a vector.\nII. The inverse square law applies to the electric force, electric field, and electric potential created by the charge.\nIII. The electric field is directed away from the particle if the charge is positive.",
