    "question": "Two identical glass plates, whose circular surfaces are carefully polished to be very flat, are arranged as shown above. At one side the pieces touch, and a thin rod is placed between them at the other side to form a wedge of air. Monochromatic light shines on the top plate, creating an interference pattern of light and dark regions. Which of the following best describes this pattern?",
