    "question": "Three identical conducting spheres, I, II, and III, are mounted on insulating stands and placed as shown above. Spheres I and II are each uncharged, and III carries a positive charge. Spheres I and II are connected to each other by a conducting wire. After the wire is removed, sphere III is moved far away. Which of the following statements about the subsequent charges on spheres I and II is correct?",
