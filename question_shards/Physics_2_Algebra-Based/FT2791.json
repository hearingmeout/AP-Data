    "question": "A square loop is located in a region containing a magnetic field of magnitude B. The following figures show five possible directions of the magnetic field relative to the loop. For which of the directions is the magnetic flux through the loop greatest?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The figure shows the arrow labeled B, directed upward and to the right and parallel to the right side of the square loop. The arrow and loop are in the same plane.",

      {
        "label": "The figure shows the arrow labeled B directed vertically through the center of the square loop from bottom to top. The arrow is perpendicular to the plane of the loop.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The figure shows the arrow labeled B directed through the loop from bottom to top but making an angle with the plane of the loop equal to near 45 degrees.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The figure shows the arrow labeled B directed through the loop from bottom to top but making a small angle near 0 degrees with the plane of the loop.",
