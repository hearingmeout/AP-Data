    "question": "The figure above shows a metal bar that is supported by two sections of a fixed, conducting U-shaped horizontal rail. The rod and rail are located in a region of magnetic field B directed into the page. The bar is moving to the right at a constant speed. Which of the following is true of the horizontal forces acting on the bar?",
