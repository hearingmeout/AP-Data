    "description": "A particle of charge +q and mass m moves toward a long wire that carries a current I. At the instant shown above, the particle is a distance r from the wire and is moving perpendicularly toward the wire with speed v. There is a magnetic force on the particle as a result of the current.",
    "question": "What is the direction of the magnetic force on the particle at the instant shown?",
