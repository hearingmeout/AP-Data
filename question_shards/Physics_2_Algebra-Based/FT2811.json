    "question": "The figure above shows a bar magnet and a conducting wire loop that is fixed in place. Which of the following would cause an induced current in the wire?\nI. Moving the magnet toward the loop at constant speed\nII. Rotating the magnet about line x, which lies along the axis of the magnet\nIII. Rotating the magnet about line y, which is perpendicular to the axis of the magnet",
