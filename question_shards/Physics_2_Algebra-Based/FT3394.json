    "question": "A beam of white light is incident on a triangular glass prism with an index of refraction of about 1.5 for visible light, producing a spectrum. Initially, the prism is in a glass aquarium filled with air, as shown above. If the aquarium is filled with water with an index of refraction of 1.3, which of the following is true?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "No spectrum is produced.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A spectrum is produced, but the deviation of the beam is opposite to that in air.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The positions of red and violet are reversed in the spectrum.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The spectrum produced has greater separation between red and violet than that produced in air.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The spectrum produced has less separation between red and violet than that produced in air.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The spectrum produced has less separation between red and violet than that produced in air."
