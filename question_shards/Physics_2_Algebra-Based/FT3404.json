    "question": "An ideal gas is initially in a state that corresponds to point 1 on the graph above, where it has pressure p1 volume V1, and temperature T1. The gas undergoes an isothermal process represented by the curve shown, which takes it to a final state 3 at temperature T3. If T2 and T4 are the temperatures the gas would have at points 2 and 4, respectively, which of the following relationships is true?",
