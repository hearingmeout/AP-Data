    "question": "A sample of an ideal gas is in a tank of constant volume. The sample absorbs heat energy so that its temperature changes from 300 K to 600 K. If v1 is the average speed of the gas molecules before the absorption of heat and v, is their average speed after the absorption of heat, what is the ratio v2/ v1 ?",
