    "description": "Two concentric circular loops of radii b and 2b, made of the same type of wire, lie in the plane of the page, as shown above.",
    "question": "A uniform magnetic field B that is perpendicular to the plane of the page now passes through the loops, as shown above. The field is confined to a region of radius a, where a < b, and is changing at a constant rate. The induced emf in the wire loop of radius b is ε. What is the induced emf in the wire loop of radius 2b ?",
