    "question": "In the circuit shown above, A, B, C, and D are identical lightbulbs. Assume that the battery maintains a constant potential difference between its terminals (i.e., the internal resistance of the battery is assumed to be negligible) and the resistance of each lightbulb remains constant.\n\n(a) Draw a diagram of the circuit in the box below, using the following symbols to represent the components in your diagram. Label the resistors A, B, C, and D to refer to the corresponding lightbulbs.\n\n(b) List the bulbs in order of their brightnesses, from brightest to least bright. If any two or more bulbs have the same brightness, state which ones. Justify your answer.\n\n(c) Bulb D is then removed from its socket.\n\ni. Describe the change in the brightness, if any, of bulb A when bulb D is removed from its socket. Justify your answer.\n\nii. Describe the change in the brightness, if any, of bulb B when bulb D is removed from its socket. Justify your answer.",
