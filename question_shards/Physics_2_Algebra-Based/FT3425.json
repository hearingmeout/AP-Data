    "question": "The long, straight wire shown in Figure 1 above is in the plane of the page and carries a current I. Point P is also in the plane of the page and is a perpendicular distance d from the wire. Gravitational effects are negligible.(a) With reference to the coordinate system in Figure 1, what is the direction of the magnetic field at point P due to the current in the wire?A particle of mass m and positive charge q is initially moving parallel to the wire with a speed v0 when it is at point P, as shown in Figure 2 below.(b) With reference to the coordinate system in Figure 2, what is the direction of the magnetic force acting on the particle at point P ?(c) Determine the magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the particle at point P in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants.(d) An electric field is applied that causes the net force on the particle to be zero at point P.i. With reference to the coordinate system in Figure 2, what is the direction of the electric field at point P that could accomplish this?ii. Determine the magnitude of the electric field in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants.",
