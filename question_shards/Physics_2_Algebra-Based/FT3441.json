    "question": "Two objects are heated to different temperatures. The objects are then placed in thermal contact with each other and insulated from their surroundings. After equilibrium is reached, which of the following must be true?\n\nI. The temperatures of the two objects are equal.\n\nII. The amount of thermal energy lost by one object equals that gained by the other object.\n\nIII. The total energy of the insulated system has not changed.",
