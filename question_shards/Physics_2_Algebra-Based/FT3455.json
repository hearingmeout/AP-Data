    "question": "A circular loop of wire in a uniform magnetic field rotates at a constant rotational speed about the axis shown. At time t = 0 the plane of the loop is parallel to the field with point P at the top as shown above left. At time t= t1 the loop has rotated 180° so that point P is at the bottom as shown above right. Which of the following graphs best represents the magnetic flux through the loop as a function of time t from 0 to t1 ?",
