    "question": "A conducting spherical shell of radius R has charge q uniformly distributed on its outer surface. The graph above represents electric field strength E versus distance r from the center of the spherical shell. Which of the following graphs best represents E versus r when the charge on the spherical shell is doubled to 2q ?",
