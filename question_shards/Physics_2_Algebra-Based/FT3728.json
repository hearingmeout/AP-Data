    "question": "A series of measurements are made of the pressure P and the volume V of a sample of nitrogen gas kept at a constant temperature. It is desired to represent the data graphically so that the graph will be a straight line if the behavior of the gas is ideal. Accordingly, which of the following should be plotted?",
