    "question": "The index of refraction of air increases linearly with its density. A ray of light passes through an interface from vacuum into air. Statements that are true as the air is heated at constant pressure include which of the following?\nI. The frequency of refracted light in the air decreases.\nII. The wavelength of refracted light in the air decreases.\nIII. The speed of light in the air increases.",
