      {
        "label": "Choice A shows a triangular glass prism. The triangle is equilateral and the lower edge is horizontal. A light ray is shown passing through the prism from left to right. The light ray is pointing up and to the right as it is incident on the left edge of the prism, horizontal as it passes through the prism, and pointing up and to the right again after passing out of the prism through the right edge.",

The light ray passes into the sphere and moves along a straight line through the center of the sphere and leaves the sphere at a point on the right side of the sphere below the middle of the sphere but above the bottom of the sphere.",

The ray is reflected straight down and hits the bottom half of the concave mirror. The ray is then reflected again down and to the left. The angle of the incident ray above the horizontal is less than the angle of the final reflected ray below the horizontal.",

A light ray is incident up and to the right on the lower half of the curved side. When the ray passes into the lens the angle changes so it still points up and to the right, butless up than before entering the lens. The ray then leaves through the flat side of the lens. It is still traveling up and to the right but is now traveling more up than before it entered the lens.",
