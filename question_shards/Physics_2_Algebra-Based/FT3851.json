    "question": "Two conducting wire loops move near a very long, straight conducting wire that carries a current I. When the loops are in the positions shown above, they are moving in the directions shown with the same constant speed v. Assume that the loops are far enough apart that they do not affect each other. Which of the following is true about the induced electric currents, if any,in the loops?",
