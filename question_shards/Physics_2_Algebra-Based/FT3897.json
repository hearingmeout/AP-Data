    "question": "As shown above, a positively charged particle moves to the right without deflection through a pair of charged plates. Between the plates are a uniform electric field E of magnitude 6.0 N/C and a uniform magnetic field B of magnitude 2.0 T, directed as shown in the figure. The speed of the particle is most nearly",
