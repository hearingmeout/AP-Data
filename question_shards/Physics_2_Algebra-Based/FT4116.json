    "question": "Three identical conducting spheres, S1, S2, and S3, are supported by insulating thread, as shown above. Initially, sphere S1 has a net positive charge and the other two spheres are uncharged. Spheres S1 and S2 are brought into contact and then separated. Next, spheres S2 and S3 are brought into contact and then separated. Which of the following shows the signs of the final net charges on the spheres?",
