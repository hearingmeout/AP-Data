    "question": "A slab of metal and a slab of wood are placed in a classroom and allowed to sit undisturbed for a long time. A student then places one hand on the metal and the other hand on the wood. Which of the following describes the student’s perception of the temperatures of the slabs and their actual temperatures?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The metal slab feels colder to the student because it is at a lower temperature.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The metal slab feels colder to the student because it conducts thermal energy away from the student’s hand faster, but the slabs have the same temperature.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The metal slab feels warmer to the student because it conducts thermal energy to the student’s hand faster, but the slabs have the same temperature.",

        "label": "Both slabs feel the same to the student because they are at the same temperature.",
