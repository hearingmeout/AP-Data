    "question": "In the figure above, the initially uncharged insulating rod on the left is free to rotate on an insulating stand. End X is then rubbed with a piece of fur. End Z of a second insulating rod is also rubbed with fur and then brought near the first rod. As the second rod is moved around, it is found that end Y of the first rod is attracted to end Z, and end X is repelled. Which of the following correctly describes the signs of the charges on ends X and Y, if any?",
