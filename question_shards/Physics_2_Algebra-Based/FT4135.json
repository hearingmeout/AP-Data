    "question": "The figure above shows a long conducting wire that lies in the plane of the page and carries an electric current I toward the right. At the instant shown, a positive point charge +q is in the plane of the page and moving toward the bottom of the page. What is the direction of the magnetic force on the point charge at that instant?",
