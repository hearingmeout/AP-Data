    "question": "A scientist is studying the radioactive decay of an element and wants to determine the sign of some of the particles emitted. The scientist lets a beam of the particles, all with the same speed, pass through an opening in a shield and enter the field created by a wire carrying a constant current. Paths 1 and 2 represent the observed paths of the particles. Based on the paths, which of the following could be the types of particles?",
