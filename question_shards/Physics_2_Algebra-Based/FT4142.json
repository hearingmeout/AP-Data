    "question": "The energy states for an electron in a hypothetical atom are represented above. A cold sample of gas of such atoms is illuminated by a brief flash of light with a continuous spectrum. The atoms are then observed to emit light with discrete wavelengths. Which of the following transitions produces the longest wavelength light?",
