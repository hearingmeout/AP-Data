    "description": "Refer to the material below to answer the following questions.\n\nA group of students collected data using a lens. They varied the distance so of an object from the lens and measured the image distance si. The figure above is their graph of the inverse of the image distance as a function of the inverse of the object distance.",
    "question": "What is the magnitude of the image’s magnification when the object is placed 2 m from the lens?",
