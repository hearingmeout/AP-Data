    "question": "A partially evacuated vertical cylindrical container is covered by a circular lid that makes an airtight seal. The pressure in the room surrounding the container is 1.01 × 105 N/m2, and the pressure inside the container is 0.41 × 105 N/m2. The lid has radius 0.20 m and weight 200 N. The minimum upward applied force required to lift the lid is most nearly",
