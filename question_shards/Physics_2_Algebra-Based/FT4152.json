    "question": "The figure above shows a long, straight wire that has a steady current I in the +y-direction. A small object with charge +q hangs from a thread near the wire. A student wants to investigate the magnetic force on the object due to the current but is not able to observe or measure changes in the tension in the string. Of the following actions that the student can take, which will allow the student to observe a reaction of the object due to the magnetic force on it?",
