    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Option A consists of a rectangle representing a thick metal plate and its charges. The figure shows 10 negative charges along the top of the plate, and 10 positive charges along the bottom of the plate.  The charges are closer together near the center of the plate, and some charge is on the right and left sides of the plate.",
