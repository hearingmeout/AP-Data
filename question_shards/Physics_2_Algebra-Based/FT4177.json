    "question": "Three identical, small cork spheres are released from rest in a uniform electric field directed downward toward the floor. Sphere X is uncharged, but spheres Y and Z are charged. Sphere Z remains suspended in the field. Spheres X and Y fall downward, but sphere X takes a longer time to reach the floor. What are the signs of the charges on spheres Y and Z ?",
