    "question": "A beam of electrons travels between two parallel wire coils, as shown in the figures above. When the coils carry no current, the electron beam is undeflected and hits the center of the screen, as indicated by the dashed line. When a constant current I in the indicated direction is created in the coils, the electron beam is deflected toward which edge of the screen?",
