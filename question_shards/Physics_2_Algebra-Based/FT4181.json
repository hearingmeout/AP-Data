    "question": "A student performs an experiment to determine the index of refraction of a plastic block. The student shines a laser beam from air (nair = 1) into a piece of plastic (nplastic) at an angle of incidence θ1 and measures the angle of refraction θ2, as shown in Figure 1 above. Measurements are taken as θ1 is increased. From the data the student produces the two graphs shown below.\n\nWhich of the following is equal to the index of refraction of the plastic block.",
