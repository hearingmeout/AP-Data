    "question": "In the circuit represented above, two resistors (R1 and R2), a capacitor C, and an open switch S are connected to a battery. The circuit reaches equilibrium. The switch is then closed, and the circuit is allowed to come to a new equilibrium. Which of the following is a true statement about the energy stored in the capacitor after the switch is closed compared with the energy stored in the capacitor before the switch is closed?",
