    "description": "An isolated, neutral lambda particle (A0) is moving to the right with speed v. It then decays into a proton and a pion (A0 → p+ + π - ). The following are the masses of the three particles:\nLambda: 1115.7 MeV/c2\nProton: 938.3 MeV/c2\nPion: 139.6 MeV/c2",
    "question": "At some later time, the proton and pion are both moving to the right in the plane of the page when they enter a magnetic field directed out of the page. Which of the following describes the directions of the magnetic forces on the proton and pion at the instant they enter the field?",
