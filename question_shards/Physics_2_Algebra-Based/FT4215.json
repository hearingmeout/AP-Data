    "description": "The figure above on the left represents the horizontal electric field near the center of two large, vertical parallel plates near Earth’s surface. The plates have height h and length ℓ, and they are separated by a distance w, as shown on the right. The field has magnitude E. A small object with mass m and charge +q, where m = qE/g, is released from rest at a point midway between the plates.",
    "question": "Points R, S, T, and U are located between the plates as shown in the figure above, with points R and T equidistant from point S. Let VRS , VST , VTU, and VRU be the magnitudes of the electric potential differences between the pairs of points. How do the magnitudes of these potential differences compare?",
