    "description": "The figure above on the left represents the horizontal electric field near the center of two large, vertical parallel plates near Earth’s surface. The plates have height h and length ℓ, and they are separated by a distance w, as shown on the right. The field has magnitude E. A small object with mass m and charge +q, where m = qE/g, is released from rest at a point midway between the plates.",
    "question": "After the object is released from rest, which of the paths shown in the figure above is a possible trajectory for the object?",
