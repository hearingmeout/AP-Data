    "question": "Students are performing an experiment to determine how changing the area of the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor affects its behavior in a circuit. They connect a capacitor with plate area A to a battery and allow it to become fully charged. They take measurements that they believe will allow them to calculate the charge q on one plate of the capacitor. The students then repeat the procedure with other capacitors. The capacitors each have a different plate area but are otherwise identical. The students plot the calculated charge q as a function of plate area A. Their results, including a best fit to the data, are represented above. Is this graph a reasonably accurate representation of the relationship between q and A?",
