    "question": "Three different gas samples that have the same number of molecules and are at room temperature are kept at different pressures. A lab technician has determined the molecular mass of each gas and recorded the pressure and molecular mass of each sample in the table below.\n\nWhich of the following ranks the density ρ of the gas samples?",
