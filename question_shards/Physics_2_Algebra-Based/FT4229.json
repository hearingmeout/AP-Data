    "question": "Light from a source that produces a single frequency passes through a single slit A. The diffraction pattern on a screen is observed. Slit A is then replaced by slit B, and the new pattern is observed to have fringes that are more closely spaced than those in the first pattern. Which of the following is a possible explanation for why the spacings are different?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Slit A is wider than slit B.",
