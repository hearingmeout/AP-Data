    "question": "Students in a lab group are given a plastic block with a hollow space in the middle, as shown in the figures above. The index of refraction nP of the plastic is known. The hollow space is filled with a gas, and the students are asked to collect the data needed to find the index of refraction nG of the gas. The arrow represents a light beam that they shine into the plastic. They take the following set of measurements: The three measurements are shared with a second lab group. Can the second group determine a value of nG from only this data?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because they have information about the beam in air and in the plastic above the gas.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because they have information about the beam on both sides of the gas.",

      {
        "label": "No, because they need additional information to determine the angle of the beam in the gas.",

      {
        "label": "No, because they do not have multiple data points to analyze.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because they need additional information to determine the angle of the beam in the gas."
