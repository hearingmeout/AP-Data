    "question": "An ideal monatomic gas is compressed while its temperature is held\n constant. What happens to the internal energy of the gas during this\n process, and why?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "It decreases because the gas does work on its surroundings.",

        "label": "It decreases because the molecules of an ideal gas collide.",
