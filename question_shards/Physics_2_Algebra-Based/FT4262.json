It is depicted with a short upward arrow perpendicular to a horizontal line, that is, the central axis, which passes through the mirror. The focal point of the mirror, labeled F, and the center of curvature, labeled C, are marked behind the mirror, along the central axis. An incident ray directed from the top of the object toward the center of the mirror, which lies on the central axis, reflects back below the central axis.",
