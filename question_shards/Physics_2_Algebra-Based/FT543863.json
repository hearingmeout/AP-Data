    "question": "The diagram above of pressure P versus volume V shows the expansion of 2.0 moles of a monatomic ideal gas from state A to state B. As shown in the diagram, PA = PB = 600 N/m2 , VA = 3.0 m3 , and VB = 9.0 m3.\n\n(a)\n\nCalculate the work done by the gas as it expands.\n\nCalculate the change in the internal energy of the gas as it expands.\n\nCalculate the head added to or removed from the gas during this expansion.\n\n(b) The pressure is then reduced to 200 N/m2 without changing the volume as the gas is taken from state B to state C. Label state on the diagram and draw a line or curve to represent the process from state B to state C.\n\n(c) The gas is then compressed isothermally back to state A.\n\nDraw a line or curve on the diagram to represent this process.\n\nIs head added to or removed from the gas during this isothermal compression?\n\n____added to ____removed from\n\nJustify your answer.",
