    "question": "A 120 V power supply is connected through a 20 A fuse to a circuit in which a coffeemaker is connected in parallel with a toaster. When each device is individually connected to the 120 V power supply, the coffeemaker dissipates energy at the rate of 300 W, and the toaster dissipates energy at a rate of 1000 W. The fuse is a safety device in which a wire of negligible resistance will melt and break the circuit when the current through it exceeds 20 A (called “blowing the fuse”).\n\nUsing the symbols above, draw a circuit diagram below showing the power supply, the fuse, and the two appliances.\n\nCalculate the current through the fuse when both appliances are operating at the given energy rates.\n\nCalculate the resistance of each appliance when operating at the given energy rates.\n\nCalculate the maximum power rating of a hair dryer that could be operated in parallel with the other two appliances without blowing the fuse.\n\nCan the coffeemaker and toaster be connected in series with the power supply without blowing the fuse when they are turned on?\n ____ Yes ____ No\nJustify your answer.",
