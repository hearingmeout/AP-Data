    "question": "A cylindrical container is fitted with a frictionless piston that is initially locked in place. The cylinder contains a fixed amount of an ideal gas that is initially at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\n(a) The cylinder is placed in a hot-water bath. On the axes below, sketch a graph of pressure versus temperature for the process the gas undergoes as a result, and indicate the direction of the process on the graph.\n\n(b) The cylinder is removed from the hot-water bath. After equilibrium is reached, the lock is removed so the piston is free to move. Indicate whether the piston moves up, moves down, or remains stationary.\n\n____ Moves up ____ Moves down ____ Remains stationary\n\nJustify your answer.\n\n(c) When the system is again at equilibrium, the piston is pushed down very slowly. On the axes below, sketch a graph of pressure versus volume for the process the gas undergoes as a result, and indicate the direction of the process on the graph. Label this process “C.”\n\n(d) Now the piston is pulled up quickly, so no heat is added to or removed from the gas during the process. On the axes above, sketch a graph of pressure versus volume for the process the gas undergoes as a result, and indicate the direction of the process on the graph. Label this process “D.”",
