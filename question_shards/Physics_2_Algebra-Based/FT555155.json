    "question": "The energy-level diagram for an isolated hypothetical atom is shown above. (a) A collection of such atoms with electrons in the n=3 state undergo transitions in which the atoms only emit photons, and the electrons eventually end in the n=1 state. On the diagram above, draw arrows to indicate all possible transitions, given the starting and ending states for the electrons. (b) Calculate the longest wavelength of photons that the atom can emit during the transitions identified in part (a). (c) What is the ionization energy of an atom in the ground state? (d) Photons of energy 11.0 eV are incident on the atom. What effect can this have on an electron in the n=1 state? Justify your answer. (e) Photons of energy 14.0 eV are incident on the atom. What effect can this have on an electron in the n=1 state? Justify your answer.",
