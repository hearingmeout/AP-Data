    "question": "The figure above shows a cross section of a drinking glass (index of refraction 1.52) filled with a thin layer of liquid (index of refraction 1.33). The bottom corners of the glass are circular arcs, with the bottom right arc centered at point O. A monochromatic light source placed to the right of point P shines a beam aimed at point O at an angle of incidence θ. The flat bottom surface of the glass containing point P is frosted so that bright spots appear where light from the beam strikes the bottom surface and does not reflect. When θ=θ1, two bright spots appear on the bottom surface of the glass. The spot closer to point P will be referred to as X; the spot farther from P will be referred to as Y. The location of spot X and that of spot Y both change as θ is increased.\n\n(a) In a coherent paragraph-length answer, describe the processes involved in the formation of spots X and Y when θ = θ1 . Include an explanation of why spot Y is located farther from point P than spot X is and what factors affect the brightness of the spots.\n\n(b)When θ is increased to θ2, one of the spots becomes brighter than it was before, due to total internal reflection.\n\nOn the figure below, draw a ray diagram that clearly and accurately shows the formation of spots X and Y when θ = θ2.\n\nWhich spot, X or Y, becomes brighter than it was before due to total internal reflection? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(c) When θ is further increased to θ3, one of the spots disappears entirely.\n\nOn the figure below, draw a ray diagram that clearly and accurately shows the formation of the remaining spot, X or Y, when θ = θ3.\n\nIndicate which spot, X or Y, disappears. Explain your reasoning in terms of total internal reflection.",
