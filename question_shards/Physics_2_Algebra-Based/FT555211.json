    "question": "Students are watching a science program about the North Pole. The narrator says that cold air sinking near the North Pole causes high air pressure. Based on the narrator’s statement, a student makes the following claim: “Since cold air near the North Pole is at high pressure, temperature and pressure must be inversely related.”\n\n(a) Do you agree or disagree with the student’s claim about the relationship between pressure and temperature? Justify your answer.\n\nAfter hearing the student’s hypothesis, you want to design an experiment to investigate the relationship between temperature and pressure for a fixed amount of gas. The following equipment is available.\n\n____ A cylinder with a movable piston, shown above on the left\n\n____ A cylinder with a fixed lid, shown above on the right\n\nNote: The two cylinders have gaskets through which measurement instruments can be inserted without gas escaping.\n\n____ A pressure sensor                                            ____ A source of mixed ice and water\n\n____ A basin that is large enough to hold                ____ A meterstick\n\neither cylinder with a lot of extra room            ____ A thermometer\n\n____ A source of hot water                                       ____ A stopwatch\n\n(b) Put a check in the blank next to each of the items above that you would need for your investigation. Outline the experimental procedure you would use to gather the necessary data. Make sure the outline contains sufficient detail so that another student could follow your procedure.\n\nThe table below shows data from a different experiment in which the volume, temperature, and pressure of a sample of gas are varied.\n\n(c) What subset of the experimental trials would be most useful in creating a graph to determine the relationship between temperature and pressure for a fixed amount of gas? Explain why the trials you selected are most useful.\n\n(d) Plot the subset of data chosen in part (c) on the axes below. Be sure to label the axes appropriately. Draw a curve or line that best represents the relationship between the variables.\n\n(e) What can be concluded from your curve or line about the relationship between temperature and pressure?",
