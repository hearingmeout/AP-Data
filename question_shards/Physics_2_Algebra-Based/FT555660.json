    "question": "The circuit above contains a battery with negligible internal resistance, a closed switch S, and three resistors, each with a resistance of R or 2R. (a) Rank the currents in the three resistors from greatest to least, with number 1 being greatest. If two resistors have the same current, give them the same ranking. _____IA _____IB _____IC Justify your answers. (b) Rank the voltages across the three resistors from greatest to least, with number 1 being greatest. If two resistors have the same voltage across them, give them the same ranking. _____VA _____VB _____VC ii. Justify your answers. For parts (c) through (e), use ε = 12V and R=200 Ω. (c) Calculate the equivalent resistance of the circuit. (d) Calculate the current in resistor RC. (e) The switch S is opened, resistor RB is removed and replaced by a capacitor of capacitance 2.0 x 10-6 F, and the switch S is again closed. Calculate the charge on the capacitor after all the currents have reached their final steady-state values.",
