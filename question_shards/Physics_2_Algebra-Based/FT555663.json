    "question": "You are asked to experimentally determine the focal length of a converging lens.\n\n(a) Your teacher first asks you to estimate the focal length by using a distant tree visible through the laboratory window. Explain how you will estimate the focal length.\n\nTo verify the value of the focal length, you are to measure several object distances so and image distances si using equipment that can be set up on a tabletop in the laboratory.\n\n(b) In addition to the lens, which of the following equipment would you use to obtain the data?\n\n_____Lighted candle\n\n_____Candleholder\n\n_____Desk lamp\n\n_____Plane mirror\n\n_____Vernier caliper\n\n_____Meterstick\n\n_____Ruler\n\n_____Lens holder\n\n_____Stopwatch\n\n_____Screen\n\n_____Diffraction grating\n\n(c) On the tabletop below, sketch the setup used to obtain the data, labeling the lens, the distances so and si, and the equipment checked in part (b).\n\nYou are to determine the focal length using a linear graph of 1/si versus 1/so. Assume that you obtain the following data for object distance so and image distance si.\n\n(d) On the grid below, plot the points in the last two columns of the table and draw a best-fit line though the points.\n\n(e) Calculate the focal length from the best-fit line.",
