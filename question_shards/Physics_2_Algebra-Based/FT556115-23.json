Explain your reasoning.\n\n(c) Calculate the distance of the image from the center of the lens.\n\n(d) Calculate the ratio of the image size to the object size.\n\n(e) The object A is now moved to the right from x=6 cm to a position of x=20 cm, as shown above. Describe the image position, size, and orientation when the object is at x=20 cm.",
