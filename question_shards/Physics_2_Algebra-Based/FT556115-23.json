(a) On the figure below, draw a ray diagram showing the position and size of the image formed. (b) State whether the image is real or virtual. Explain your reasoning. (c) Calculate the distance of the image from the center of the lens. (d) Calculate the ratio of the image size to the object size. (e) The object A is now moved to the right from x=6 cm to a position of x=20 cm, as shown above. Describe the image position, size, and orientation when the object is at x=20 cm.",
