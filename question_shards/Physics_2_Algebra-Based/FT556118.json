    "question": "A photon of wavelength 2.0 x 10-11 m strikes a free electron of mass me that is initially at rest, as shown above left. After the collision, the photon is shifted in wavelength by an amount ∆λ = 2h/mec, and reversed in direction, as shown above right. (a) Determine the energy injoules of the incident photon. (b) Determine the magnitude of the momentum of the incident photon. (c) Indicate below whether the photon wavelength is increased or decreased by the interaction. ____Increased ____Decreased Explain your reasoning. (d) Determine the magnitude of the momentum acquired by the electron.",
