    "question": "Two moles of a monatomic ideal gas are enclosed in a cylinder by a movable piston. The gas is taken through the thermodynamic cycle shown in the figure above. The piston has a cross sectional area of 5 × 10-3 m2 Calculate the force that the gas exerts on the piston in state A, and explain how the collisions of the gas atoms with the piston allow the gas to exert a force on the piston. Calculate the temperature of the gas in state B, and indicate the microscopic property of the gas that is characterized by the temperature. Predict qualitatively how the internal energy of the gas changes as it is taken from state A to state B. Justify your prediction. Calculate the energy added to the gas by heating as it is taken from state A to state C along the path ABC. Determine the change in the total kinetic energy of the gas atoms as the gas is taken directly from state C to state A.",
