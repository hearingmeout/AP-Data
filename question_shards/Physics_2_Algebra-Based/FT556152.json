    "question": "Three samples of a gas, X, Y, and Z, are prepared. Each sample contains the same number of molecules, but the samples are at different temperatures. The temperature of sample X is TX, the temperature of sample Y is lower than that of sample X, and the temperature of sample Z is lower than that of sample Y (TX> TY >TZ ).\n\n(a) The graph below shows the distribution of the speeds of the molecules in sample Y. On the graph, sketch and label possible distributions for sample X and sample Z.\n\nThe three samples with initial temperatures TX> TY >TZ are placed in thermal contact, with sample Z in the middle, as shown below, and the samples are insulated from their surroundings. The samples can exchange thermal energy but not gas molecules. The samples eventually reach thermal equilibrium, with a final temperature greater than TY.\n\n(b) In a few sentences, describe the change over time in the average kinetic energy of the molecules of each sample, from initial contact until they reach thermal equilibrium. Explain how these changes relate to the energy flow between the pairs of samples that are in contact.\n\nSample X\n\nSample Y\n\nSample Z\n\n(c) Indicate whether the entropy of sample X increases, decreases, or remains the same as a result of the process of reaching thermal equilibrium.\n\n____ Increases ____ Decreases ____ Remains the same\n\nJustify your answer at the microscopic level.\n\n(d) For the three-sample system, indicate whether the entropy of the system increases, decreases, or remains the same as a result of the process of reaching thermal equilibrium.\n\n____ Increases ____ Decreases ____ Remains the same\n\nJustify your answer.",
