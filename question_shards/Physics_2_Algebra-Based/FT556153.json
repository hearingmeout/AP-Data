    "question": "Students are given some resistors with various resistances, a battery with internal resistance, and an ammeter. They are asked to determine the emf ε and internal resistance r of the battery using just this equipment. Working with the circuit shown above, they insert each resistor into the circuit and measure the current I in the circuit each time they insert a resistor. From their data, the students generate a graph of 1/I as a function of the resistance R of each resistor, as shown above.\n\n(a)\n\nWrite an algebraic equation describing the circuit that includes ε , R, r, and I.\n\nUse your equation and the graph to calculate the emf of the battery and the internal resistance of the battery.\n\nThe students are now given a voltmeter and a new resistor X to use with the resistors, battery, and ammeter they already have. They are asked to determine whether resistor X is ohmic.\n\n(b)\n\nUsing standard symbols for circuit elements, as in the previously shown circuit, draw a diagram of a circuit that the students could use to determine whether resistor X is ohmic, including the appropriate placement of the meters. Clearly label your diagram.\n\nDescribe the procedure you would use with your circuit to get enough data to determine whether resistor X is ohmic.\n\nWhat would you graph using your data, and what would you look for on your graph to determine whether resistor X is ohmic?\n\n(c) Would your procedure or data analysis in part (b) need to be different if the internal resistance of the battery was nonohmic? Justify your answer.",
