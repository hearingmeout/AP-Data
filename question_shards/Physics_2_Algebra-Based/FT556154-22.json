    "question": "A particle with unknown mass and charge is projected into the apparatus shown above. The particle moves with constant speed v as it passes undeflected through a pair of parallel plates, as shown above. The plates are separated by a distance d, and a constant potential difference V is maintained between them. A uniform magnetic field of magnitude B directed into the page exists both in the region between the plates and in the region to the right of the plates that is enclosed by the dashed lines. In the region to the right of the plates, the particle’s path is circular with radius r. Assume the effects of gravity are negligible compared to other forces.\n\n(a) Explain why the particle moves through the parallel plates undeflected in terms of the forces exerted on the particle.\n\n(b) What is the sign of the charge on the particle? Justify your answer.\n\nA magnetic field of 0.30 T is applied with the plate separation at 5.0 x 10-3m . Singly ionized particles with various speeds enter the region between the plates, and only those with speed 2.0 x 106 m/s are undeflected as they pass between the plates. These particles then reach the collector plate a distance of 0.42 m below the point at which they left the region between the parallel plates.\n\n(c) Based on your explanation in part (a), derive an algebraic expression for the potential difference that must be applied to produce the motion of the undeflected particles. Use that expression to calculate the numerical value of the potential difference.\n\n(d) By analyzing the circular part of the motion, derive an algebraic expression for the mass of the particles. Use that expression to calculate a numerical value for the mass.\n\n(e) A scientist wants to use the apparatus to separate singly ionized atoms of 12C and 14C in order to use the 14C in radiocarbon dating. Describe how the motion of the two isotopes of carbon in both regions of the apparatus leads to their separation, appropriately relating your description to the algebraic equations you wrote in parts (c) and (d).",
