    "question": "An insulated container with a divider in the middle contains two separated gases. Gas 1 is initially at a higher temperature than gas 2. The divider is then removed. Which of the following observations might be made over a period of time as the two gases mix together, and why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Gas 1 remains at a higher temperature than gas 2 because gas 1 started at a higher temperature.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Gas 1 remains at a higher temperature than gas 2 because gas 1 started with a higher kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "On average, the molecules of gas 1 lose all of their kinetic energy to the molecules of gas 2 through collisions, resulting in gas 2 eventually having a higher temperature than gas 1.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "On average, the molecules of gas 1 lose some of their kinetic energy to the molecules of gas 2 through collisions, resulting in the two gases eventually having the same temperature.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "On average, the molecules of gas 1 lose some of their kinetic energy to the molecules of gas 2 through collisions, resulting in the two gases eventually having the same temperature."
