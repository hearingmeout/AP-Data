    "question": "The figure above shows three objects (X, Y, and Z) that have charges -4q, +q, and -q, respectively. The objects are held fixed on an axis at the positions shown. The magnitude of the electrostatic force exerted by object Y on object Z is F. What is the magnitude of the net electrostatic force exerted on object Y due to the other two objects?",
