    "question": "An ideal gas is initially in state 1 at a temperature of 200 K. The gas is taken through the two reversible thermodynamic processes shown in the PV diagram above. The process from state 1 to state 2 is isothermal. The process from state 2 to state 3 is isobaric. What is the temperature of the gas when it is in state 3?",
