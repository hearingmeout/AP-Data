    "question": "Two metal bars with the same length and same cross-sectional area are placed between two tanks with temperatures of 400 K and 300 K, as shown above. The thermal conductivity of the top bar is 200 W/ m ⋅ K, and that of the bottom bar is 400 W/ m ⋅ K . If the net energy transferred through the top bar in a given time interval is Q, what is the net energy transferred through the bottom bar during the same time interval?",
