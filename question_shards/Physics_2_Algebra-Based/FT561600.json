    "question": "A ray of light in air (n = 1.0) is incident on glass (n = 1.5) at a small angle θa to normal. The angle of the ray to the normal in the glass is θg. The speeds of light in air and the glass are va and vg, respectively. How do the values of the speed of light and the angle of the ray of light to the normal in air compare to those in the glass?",
