    "question": "The graph above shows pressure as a function of volume for a sample of an ideal gas. The gas has an internal energy of 1000 J at state X and is taken through the cycle shown. Process 3 is isothermal. The work that the gas does on the environment is 400 J during process 1 and 250 J during one complete cycle. What is the net thermal energy transferred into the gas during one complete cycle?",
