    "question": "An initially uncharged electroscope consists of two thin, 50 cm long conducting wires attached to a cap, with a 25 g conducting sphere attached to the other end of each wire. When a charged rod is brought close to but not touching the cap, as shown above, the spheres separate a distance of 30 cm. What can be determined about the induced charge on each sphere from this information?",
