    "question": "A student is given a loudspeaker with a square opening and asked to make a change in the dimensions of the opening so that the sound wave is more spread out vertically and narrowed horizontally. Which of the following is the correct use of the principle of diffraction to accomplish the desired result?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The task is impossible since diffraction affects only electromagnetic radiation and very short wavelengths.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Make the opening into a rectangle with a longer vertical dimension and a shorter horizontal dimension.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Make the opening into a rectangle with a longer horizontal dimension and a shorter vertical dimension.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Keep the opening in the shape of a square, but reduce both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Make the opening into a rectangle with a longer horizontal dimension and a shorter vertical dimension."
