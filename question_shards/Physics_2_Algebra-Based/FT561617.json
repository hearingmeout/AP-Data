    "question": "A student in an electronics lab is studying the electrical properties of pieces of graphite. The student applies a potential difference of 24 V across the length of a cylindrical piece of graphite with a radius of 0.5 mm. The student has another piece of graphite of the same length but with a radius of 0.7 mm. The student wants the same current in both pieces of graphite. What potential difference should the student apply across the 0.7 mm piece?",
