    "description": "Two identical, uncharged, nonconducting spheres hang vertically from insulating strings and are a distance of 10 cm apart, as shown in the figure above. The spheres are then each given a net charge; sphere A gets -10 μC and sphere B gets -20 μC . The spheres are allowed to come to rest in a new equilibrium configuration.",
    "question": "Consider a system defined as only spheres A and B. In the new equilibrium configuration, how (if at all) has the potential energy of the system changed compared to when the spheres were initially uncharged, and why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The potential energy of the system has remained the same, because the spheres are still at the same height as each other, so no energy is stored.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The potential energy of the system has increased, because the two spheres repel each other, storing energy in an electric field.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The potential energy of the system has increased, because the charged spheres are at a higher vertical position, storing energy in a gravitational field.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The potential energy of the system has decreased, because the charged spheres will repel each other rather than attract, reducing the energy stored in the electric field.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The potential energy of the system has increased, because the two spheres repel each other, storing energy in an electric field."
