    "description": "Two identical, uncharged, nonconducting spheres hang vertically from insulating strings and are a distance of 10 cm apart, as shown in the figure above. The spheres are then each given a net charge; sphere A gets -10 μC and sphere B gets -20 μC . The spheres are allowed to come to rest in a new equilibrium configuration.",
    "question": "Consider a position P located halfway between the charged spheres in their new equilibrium configuration. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the electric potential at this position is positive, negative, or zero and explains why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Zero, because without a charge at position P no electric potential can exist there.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Zero, because both spheres are located the same distance from position P, so the contributions from each charge cancel each other out.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Positive, because both negatively charged spheres contribute a negative electric potential, and these negatives multiplied together produce a net positive electric potential.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Negative, because both negatively charged spheres contribute a negative electric potential to the total.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Negative, because both negatively charged spheres contribute a negative electric potential to the total."
