    "question": "Two electrically neutral conducting rods are near a negatively charged sphere, as shown in the figure above. Rod 1 is touched to rod 2 for several seconds, and then the rods are separated. The rods are then both removed from the vicinity of the charged sphere. Which of the following best describes the resulting net charge on each rod?",
