    "question": "Two uncharged conducting spheres on insulating stands are in contact when a positively charged rod is brought near but does not touch them, as shown in the figure above. The right sphere is then moved far to the right, and finally the rod is removed. Which of the following best shows the final distribution of excess charges, if any, on the spheres?",
