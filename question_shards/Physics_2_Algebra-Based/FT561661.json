    "question": "A small, well-insulated building is kept cool on a hot day. A person in the building holds a hand close to, but not touching, a solid metal door to the outside and feels warmth coming from the metal door. Which statement best describes how most of the energy is transferred from the outside to the person’s hand?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Thermal energy from the outside is convected through the metal door. Thermal energy from the door is conducted by the air and is detected by the person’s hand.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Thermal energy from the outside is convected through the metal door. The door radiates energy that is detected by the person’s hand.",
