    "description": "A student performs an experiment using the circuit shown above, with the goal of determining the characteristics of the battery, which has nonnegligible internal resistance. The student has many resistors with resistances ranging from 0.5 Ω to 15 Ω. The student puts different resistors in the circuit and records the current and the potential difference measured by the ammeter A and voltmeter V. The student’s data table and graph of current as a function of potential difference are shown below.",
    "question": "Which of the following is most nearly the battery’s internal resistance?",
