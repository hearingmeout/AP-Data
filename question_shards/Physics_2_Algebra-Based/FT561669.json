    "description": "A student performs an experiment using the circuit shown above, with the goal of determining the characteristics of the battery, which has nonnegligible internal resistance. The student has many resistors with resistances ranging from 0.5 Ω to 15 Ω. The student puts different resistors in the circuit and records the current and the potential difference measured by the ammeter A and voltmeter V. The student’s data table and graph of current as a function of potential difference are shown below.",
    "question": "The student now replaces the battery with a different one that has the same emf but a significantly smaller internal resistance. The student runs the experiment again and graphs the new data. Which of the following correctly describes how the new graph compares to the plot shown above?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The new graph will be the same as the original graph.",

        "label": "The vertical intercept will have a greater value, but the slope will be the same.",
