Which of the figures best represents the isolines and electric field vectors around the first sphere while the second sphere is still far away?",

There are three dashed circles representing isolines drawn around the dot. There is a large amount of space between the outermost and middle isolines, and a smaller amount of space between the middle and the innermost isolines. The space between the innermost isoline and the dot is about the same as that between the two outer isolines. There are 8 short vectors pointing inward toward the sphere from the outermost isoline that extend only a short distance into the space between the two outer isolines. There are 8 long vectors pointing inward toward the sphere from the middle isoline. These vectors extend through the innermost isoline, but do not touch the sphere.",
