    "question": "The second sphere has a charge of +2.0 x 10-9 C. As it is moved closer to the first sphere at a constant speed, the second sphere passes through the circular equipotential lines due to the first sphere. Two of these lines are separated by a distance of 0.020 m and have potentials of 100 V and 150 V. What is the magnitude of the average force needed to move the second sphere between the two equipotential lines?",
