    "question": "A sample of gas is in a sealed container whose volume is held fixed. The pressure of the gas is measured as its absolute temperature is increased. A graph of pressure measurements as a function of temperature is shown above. According to the ideal gas law, which of the following is expected if the sealed container’s volume is increased to three times the original value and the experiment is repeated?",
