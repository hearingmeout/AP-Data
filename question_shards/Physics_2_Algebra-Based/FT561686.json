    "question": "A student designs an experiment intended to determine the thermal conductivity of an unknown material. Two 15 cm long bars with the same cross-sectional area are joined together, as shown in the figure above. The bar on the left is made of copper, and the bar on the right is made of the unknown material. The left and right ends of the two-bar combination are maintained at 40°C and 20°C , respectively, and the bars reach equilibrium. The student then measures the temperature T along the bars and produces the data shown in the graph, where x = 0 is the left end and 30 cm is the right end. The experimental uncertainty in the data is negligible. Which of the following can the student conclude about kc, the thermal conductivity of copper, compared with ku , the thermal conductivity of the unknown material?",
