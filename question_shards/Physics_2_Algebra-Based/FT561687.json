    "question": "A sealed container with a lid of area 0.004 m2 is filled with an ideal gas. The container and gas are allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the surrounding air. If a 2000 N block is needed to keep the lid from being pushed off the container, what is the absolute pressure inside the container (the pressure compared to vacuum) ?",
