    "question": "A supernova explosion occurs at a distance of 2×1020 m from Earth. The supernova simultaneously emits radiation at both visible and x-ray wavelengths. Which of the following statements best describes the time it takes for the two types of radiation from the supernova to reach Earth?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The two types of radiation reach Earth at the same time, within a few seconds of the supernova explosion.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The two types of radiation reach Earth at the same time, many years after the supernova explosion.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The two types of radiation reach Earth many years after the supernova explosion, but the visible radiation arrives first due to its shorter wavelength.",
        "image": null
      },
