    "question": "A battery with emf 6.0 V and an internal resistance r is connected to a resistor of resistance R, as shown in Figure 1 above. The current in the circuit is 2.0 A. When an identical battery is added to the circuit in series, as shown in Figure 2, the current in the circuit is 3.0 A. Which of the following statements about the resistances in the circuit is true?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "r is very small compared to R.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "r is very large compared to R.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "r is equal to R.",

      {
        "label": "r and R are comparable in magnitude, but they are not equal.",
