    "question": "Two samples of the same type of gas molecules are placed in different closed containers and are thermally isolated from each other and the environment. The figure above shows the distribution of speeds for the molecules in each of the samples. The two samples are now mixed together and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. Which of the following is true of the peak of the distribution for the mixed sample?",
