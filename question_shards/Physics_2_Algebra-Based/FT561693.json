    "question": "Four horizontal wires are arranged on vertical wooden poles, as shown in the figure above. The wires are equally spaced and have equal currents I in the directions indicated in the figure. The dots represent four charged dust particles moving in the plane of the wires. The sign of the charge on each particle and its direction of motion at a particular instant are shown. Which of the dust particles has a magnetic force exerted on it in the downward direction at this instant?",
