    "question": "A parallel-plate capacitor is charged so that an electric field E is created between the plates. A small oil drop with charge +q is placed halfway between the plates, as shown in Figure 1 above. The force exerted on the oil drop by the electric field is determined to have a magnitude of F. The oil drop is now moved half the distance toward the negatively charged plate, as shown in Figure 2 above. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the electric field on the oil drop at the position shown in Figure 2 ?",
