    "question": "In the circuit represented above, resistors R1 and R2, capacitor C, and open switch S are connected to a battery. The circuit reaches equilibrium. The switch is then closed, and the circuit is allowed to come to a new equilibrium. Which of the following is a true statement about the charge qf stored on the capacitor after the switch is closed compared with the charge qi stored on the capacitor before the switch is closed?",
