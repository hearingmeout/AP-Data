    "question": "Three objects—X, Y, and Z—are each given an excess electric charge. The objects are then brought near each other in pairs but do not touch. It is found that X and Y attract each other, Y and Z repel, and X and Z attract. Which of the following is a correct conclusion about the signs of the charges that can be drawn from these observations?",
