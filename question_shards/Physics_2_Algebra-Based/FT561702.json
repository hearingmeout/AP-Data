    "question": "An engineer has four wires made of the same material and wants to determine the material’s resistivity. The engineer measures the length L and cross-sectional area A of each wire. The engineer then applies a potential difference V across each wire and measures the resulting current I. To estimate the resistivity of the material using only the slope of a graph of the data, which of the following should be graphed as a function of L/A?",
