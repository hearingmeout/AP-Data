    "question": "The figure above shows energy levels for a mercury atom. A photon with energy 2.03 eV is incident on a mercury atom that is in its first excited state. The atom absorbs the photon and subsequently makes a transition to its ground state. Which of the following correctly describes the process the atom goes through?",
