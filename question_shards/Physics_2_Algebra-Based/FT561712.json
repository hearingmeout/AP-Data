    "question": "Student 1 and student 2 pull on opposite ends of a horizontal string that passes through a long, thin slit in a piece of cardboard, as shown in the top figure above. The plane of the cardboard is kept vertical, and the slit can be rotated so its angle Ɵ relative to the dashed vertical line changes. Student 1 shakes the string, creating a transverse periodic wave of constant amplitude. At his end of the string, student 2 measures the amplitude of the wave that comes through the slit as a function of the angle of the slit relative to vertical. Student 2’s data is shown in the graph. In what direction is student 1 shaking the string?",
