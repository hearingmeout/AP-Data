    "description": "The figure above shows a 10 V battery connected in a circuit with two resistors, a parallel-plate capacitor of capacitance C, and three ammeters. The circuit has been connected for a long time.",
    "question": "Assume the capacitance C of the capacitor is known. The gap between the capacitor’s plates is now filled with an unknown insulating material, and the circuit is again left connected for a long time. Measuring which of the following provides enough information to determine the unknown material’s dielectric constant k ?",
