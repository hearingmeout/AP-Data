    "question": "The figure above represents two charged, concentric conducting shells with radii R1 and R2 . The space between the shells is filled with air. The dashed lines represent equipotentials. The electric field just outside the inner shell has magnitude E1, and the electric field just inside the outer shell has magnitude E2. Which of the following statements is true of the magnitude E of the electric field at point P?",
