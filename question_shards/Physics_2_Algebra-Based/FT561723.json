    "question": "A metal sphere with a small negative charge hangs vertically from a light thread, as shown in the figure above. The metal sphere is then brought near but does not touch an uncharged plastic sphere of the same size that is also hanging vertically on a light thread. Which of the following best shows the two spheres after they have reached equilibrium?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Option A shows each sphere hanging with the thread vertical. The Metal sphere as 4 negative symbols arranged within the sphere as follows, one at the top, one at the right, one at the bottom , and one at the left. The sphere labeled Plastic has no symbols within the sphere.",

      {
        "label": "Option B shows each sphere hanging with the thread angled toward the middle and a small amount of space between the Metal sphere and the Plastic sphere. The Metal sphere has 4 negative symbols arranged within the sphere as follows, one at the top, one at the right, one at the bottom, and one at the left. The Plastic sphere has 4 positive symbols arranged within the sphere as follows, one at the top, one at the right, one at the bottom, and one at the left.",

The Metal sphere has 4 negative symbols arranged within the sphere as follows, one at the top, one at the bottom, and two along the right side (closest to the plastic sphere). The plastic sphere has 4 negative symbols and 4 positive symbols arranged in two rows that are centered vertically within the sphere. Each row is arranged as follows from left to right: positive negative, positive, negative.",

The Metal sphere has 4 negative symbols arranged within the sphere as follows, one at the top, one at the bottom, and two along the right side (closest to the plastic sphere). The Plastic sphere has 4 negative symbols and 4 positive symbols arranged in two rows that are centered vertically within the sphere.
