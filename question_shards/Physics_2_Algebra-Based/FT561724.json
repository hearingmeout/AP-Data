    "question": "A sample of gas is in a container of fixed volume. The pressure of the gas is measured as its absolute temperature is increased. A graph of pressure measurements as a function of temperature is shown above. According to the ideal gas law, which of the following will be true if the container volume is reduced to half the original value and the experiment is repeated?",
