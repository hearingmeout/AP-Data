    "question": "Two containers, each holding a different gas, are brought into thermal contact. The gas atoms in container X have twice the mass and half the average speed of the gas atoms in container Y. Which of the following best describes the energy transfer by thermal conduction, if any, between the two containers?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There is a net energy transfer from container X to container Y.",

      {
        "label": "There is no net energy transfer between the containers, because no atoms move between them.",

      {
        "label": "There is no net energy transfer between the containers, because energy is transferred at approximately equal rates in each direction.",
