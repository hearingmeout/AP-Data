    "description": "A very hot gas composed of equal numbers of positive and negative ions is in a closed, thermally insulated container and is in thermal equilibrium at temperature T0. The figure above represents the initial distribution of the ions. A strong uniform electric field directed toward the bottom of the page is now created in and around the container, and the gas is allowed to reach a new thermal equilibrium at temperature T1.",
    "question": "Which of the following best represents a possible distribution of the ions at temperature T1?",
