    "question": "The electric field is now turned off, and the gas is allowed to reach a final equilibrium temperature T2. How does T2 compare to T1, and why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "T2 is less, because the electric potential energy added by the field to separate the ions is gone once the field is turned off.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T2 is less, because pairs of positive and negative ions bond to become molecules once the field is turned off, and energy is required to create the bonds.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T2 is greater, because work is done on the ions in the process of turning off the field.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T2 is greater, because the electric potential energy of the separated ions is converted to kinetic energy as they mix and collide.",

    "answer": "T2 is greater, because the electric potential energy of the separated ions is converted to kinetic energy as they mix and collide."
