    "question": "Students in a lab are given the plunger-syringe system represented above, which contains air at room temperature. The students take their physics textbooks and place them on top of the plunger one at a time. Each time a book is added, they allow the system to come to room temperature and then record the volume of the air in the syringe. Assume that air may be treated as an ideal gas. Which of the following best represents the expected graph of the volume of the air as a function of the number of books?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Option A shows a straight line that begins near the intersection of the axes and extends up and to the right.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Option B shows a straight line that begins near the top of the vertical axis and extends down and to the right.",

      {
        "label": "Option C shows a concave up curve that begins near the top of the vertical axis and extends down and to the right and almost levels off as it approaches the horizontal axis.",

        "label": "Option D shows a concave up curve that begins near the bottom of the vertical axis and extends to the right and up and increases in slope until almost vertical.",
