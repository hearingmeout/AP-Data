    "question": "A hydrogen atom is isolated in a vacuum chamber. The electron is now separated from the proton and moved to a distance 1 cm away. Let FG be the magnitude of the gravitational force between the proton and electron, and let FE be the magnitude of the electric force between the proton and electron. How does the ratio FG /FE change as the particles are separated?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "FG /FE does not change; it is the same nonzero value for all separations.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "FG /FE becomes larger as the particles are moved apart.",
