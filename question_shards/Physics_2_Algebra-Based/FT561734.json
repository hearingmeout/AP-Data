    "question": "The gray rectangle in the figure above represents a region of uniform magnetic field directed out of the page. A square loop of wire of side s is in the plane of the page and is pulled at constant speed v through the field. Which of the following could show the current I in the loop as a function of the position of the right edge of the loop?",
