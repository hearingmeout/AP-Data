    "question": "Students are asked to perform an experiment to determine the focal length of a converging lens. They are given an optical bench that includes a lamp, a converging lens in a holder, and a screen. All three of these can be positioned anywhere along the optical bench. The students decide to form real images by placing the lamp at various specific distances from the lens and moving the screen until a focused image of the lamp filament is formed on the screen. They keep the lens at the 60 cm mark on the optical bench. The table below shows their data for the object and image distances.\n\nOn the figure below, representing the optical bench, draw and label the screen, lens, and lamp in correct positions for trial 1.\n\nWhat quantities could be plotted to create a linear graph that could be used to calculate the focal length of the lens? Justify your answer.\n\nUse the empty rows of the table above to record any values you need to calculate.\n\nOn the axes below, plot data for the quantities you indicated in part (b). Label and scale the axes.\n\nUse your graph to calculate the focal length of the lens. Show your calculations.\n\nThe students are now given a converging mirror of focal length 15 cm to replace the lens and asked to make measurements that would allow them to verify the focal length of the mirror. Describe a procedure that would result in creation of a real image from which the focal length could be determined. On the figure below, representing the optical bench, draw and label the screen, lamp, and mirror in appropriate positions. Indicate what measurements should be made and how they could be used to calculate the focal length.",
