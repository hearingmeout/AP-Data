    "question": "An uncharged air-filled capacitor has square plates of side L whose separation can be varied. The initial plate separation is d1, which is comparable to L. The capacitor is connected to a battery with potential difference V0,and a switch S, as shown above. Assume the dielectric constant of the air is 1.0 The switch is closed and remains closed for a long time On the diagram below, draw a vector at each dot to represent the electric field created by the charge on the capacitor plates . ii.The plates are now moved to a new separation d2 << d1 and allowed to reach equilibrium. Calculate the magnitude of the charge on each plate of the capacitor in terms of V0, L, d2, and physical constants, as appropriate. b. The plates are pulled apart to a separation of 2d2 , where 2d2 << d1. Suppose the switch remains closed while the plates are pulled apart. Compare the magnitude of the new electric field between the plates when their separation is 2d2 to the magnitude of the field for plate separation d2. Support your comparison using appropriate physics principles. Suppose the switch is opened before the plates are pulled apart. Compare the magnitude of the new electric field between the plates when their separation is 2d2 to the magnitude of the field for plate separation d2 . Support your claim using appropriate physics principles. c. The new circuit shown below is now assembled. The plates of the original capacitor, C1 , are at separation d2 . A second capacitor, C2 , with square plates of side 2L and plate separation d2 , is connected in parallel with the original capacitor. Both capacitors are initially uncharged. The switch is closed and the circuit reaches equilibrium. Let Q0 be the magnitude of the charge on each plate of capacitor C1 in the previous circuit, as determined in part (a)(ii). In terms of Q0 calculate the magnitude of the charge on each plate of the two capacitors in the new circuit.",
