    "question": "A capacitor initially has only air between its plates. The charge on the capacitor as a function of applied potential difference is measured, and the results are shown in graph 1 above. The capacitor is discharged, a dielectric material is inserted between the plates, and the charge as a function of applied potential difference is measured again. The results are shown in graph 2. Which of the following is equal to the dielectric constant of the material inserted into the capacitor?",
