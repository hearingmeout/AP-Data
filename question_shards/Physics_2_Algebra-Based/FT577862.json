    "question": "An electron is moving to the right, as shown in the figure above. It passes through the shaded region, which contains a magnetic field directed into the page. The electron travels along a path that takes it through point P. The gravitational force on the electron is negligible. Which of the following is a possible path of the electron?",

The path is horizontal outside the square, and it enters the square at a point near the top of the left side of the square. The path then changes abruptly to a straight line down and to the right, that continues directly to point P.",
