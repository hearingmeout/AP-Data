    "description": "Two conducting plates of area A are separated by a distance d, as shown above. The upper plate has a net charge of +Q and the lower plate has a net charge of -Q . Point P is located a distance s above the center of the lower plate and closer to the lower plate than the upper plate. Assume the plate dimensions are very large compared to d and all gravitational forces are negligible.",
    "question": "Which of the following indicates the direction of the electric field at point P and the reason it has that direction?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The electric field is in the +x direction because the charges are equal and opposite.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The electric field is in the -y direction because point P is farther from the positively charged plate.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The electric field is in the -y direction because electric fields point away from positive charge and toward negative charge.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The electric field is in the +y direction because electric fields point away from negative charge and toward positive charge.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The electric field is in the -y direction because electric fields point away from positive charge and toward negative charge."
