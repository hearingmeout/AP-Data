    "description": "Two conducting plates of area A are separated by a distance d, as shown above. The upper plate has a net charge of +Q and the lower plate has a net charge of -Q . Point P is located a distance s above the center of the lower plate and closer to the lower plate than the upper plate. Assume the plate dimensions are very large compared to d and all gravitational forces are negligible.",
    "question": "Assume the magnitude of the electric field at point P is 5.0 × 104 N/C. What is the magnitude and direction of the force on an electron at point P due to the electric field?",
