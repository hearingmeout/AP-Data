    "question": "Some students collect data to determine the focal length of a concave mirror. Using a small candle as the object, they move a piece of white cardboard until they see a focused image of the candle flame on it. The students measure the distances of the candle and the image from the mirror. A graph of the data is shown above. Which of the following is closest to the focal length of the mirror?",
