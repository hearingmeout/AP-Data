    "question": "The figure above represents three identical closed containers holding the same number of moles of different gases at the same temperature. From left to right, the gases are in order from smallest molar mass (H2) to largest molar mass (O2 ) . Modeling the gases as ideal, which gas, if any, has the greatest internal energy?",
