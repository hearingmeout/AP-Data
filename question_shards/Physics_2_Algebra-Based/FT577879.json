    "question": "A plutonium nucleus of mass M is at rest when it spontaneously emits a high-energy photon of frequency f. After the decay, the photon moves off in one direction and the nucleus recoils with speed v in the opposite direction. The nucleus’ mass decreases by an amount ∆m . Which of the following equations correctly represents the conservation of energy in the decay?",
