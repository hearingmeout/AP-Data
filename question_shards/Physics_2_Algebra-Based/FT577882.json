    "question": "Small solid sphere X is made of an insulating material and has negative charge distributed throughout its volume. Small solid sphere Y is made of a conducting material and is also negatively charged. The spheres are initially far apart and are then brought near each other, as shown above. Which of the following cross sections best represents the charge distribution on the two spheres when they are near each other? ;",
