The student assumes that the intensity of light from the bulb is directly proportional to the power it dissipates. The student measures the light intensity at one location near the bulb and the current through the bulb as the voltage across the bulb is varied. The data are shown above. Based on the data, is the bulb ohmic, and why?",
