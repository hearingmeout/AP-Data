    "question": "A student is doing an experiment in which monochromatic light passes through a double slit, creating a pattern of dark and bright lines on a nearby screen. The student has a red light and a green light. The student also has two sets of slits, one with a small separation between the slits and one with a large separation. Which of the following lists the color and slit separation that will create the pattern with the greatest separation between the bright lines?",
