    "question": "Electronic transitions between the n = 2 and n = 4 energy levels of a hydrogen atom are associated with the emission or absorption of photons of visible light of frequency f. Which of the following statements about the electronic transition from the n = 1 to the n = 4 energy level of hydrogen must be true as a consequence of energy conservation?",
