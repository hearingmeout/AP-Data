    "question": "A piece of a thick ring of metal with height h and resistance R is connected to a battery, creating a uniform current I throughout the piece of ring, as shown in the figure above. A second piece of a ring has height 2h but is otherwise identical to the first piece. The second piece of ring is connected to the battery in the same way as the first piece. What is the resistance of the second piece?",
