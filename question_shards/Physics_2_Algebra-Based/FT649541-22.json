(10 points, suggested time 20 minutes) A student is performing some lab experiments with batteries, ohmic resistors, capacitors, and some identical ohmic lightbulbs. (a) The student first connects four lightbulbs and an ideal battery as shown above in circuit 1 and observes the brightness of each lightbulb. The student then moves lightbulb C to obtain circuit 2. In a coherent, paragraph-length response, describe how the brightnesses of lightbulbs A and D in circuit 2 compare to their brightnesses in circuit 1. Support your claims with appropriate physics principles.",
