The circuit then splits into two branches. The first branch has a resistor labeled R sub 2. The second branch  has an ammeter across the top and a resistor labeled R sub 3 with a voltmeter connected across it. The branches then come together and the bottom side to the left of the junction has a variable resistor labeled R sub 1 that then connects to the battery.",
