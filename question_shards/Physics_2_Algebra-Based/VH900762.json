    "question": "A student has several conducting rods made from the same material. The rods have the same length but different square cross-sectional areas. The student places the rods in a circuit so that they have the same potential difference across them and then measures the current in each conducting rod. Which of the following graphs most likely contains a best-fit line to the graph of the current <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of the cross-sectional area <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> of the rods?",

The horizontal axis is labeled A, and the vertical axis is labeled I. The curve begins high above the horizontal axis, a little to the right of the vertical axis, and initially moves steeply downward and to the right. About one third of the way along the horizontal axis, the curve begins to level out and moves more gradually downward and to the right.",
