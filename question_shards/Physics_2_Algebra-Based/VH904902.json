    "description": "A student is performing experiments to determine the dielectric constant of various materials. The figure above shows one of the student’s circuits, containing three parallel-plate capacitors arranged in a circuit with a battery of <math alttext=\"e m f\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>e</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> <math alttext=\"V naught\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math>. The capacitors have the same plate area but have different separations, as shown, and are filled with dielectrics of unknown dielectric constant. The circuit has reached steady state.",
    "question": "The dielectric is now removed from capacitor <math alttext=\"Z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>Z</mi></mrow></math>, and the circuit is again allowed to reach steady state. Which of the following statements about the potential difference across each capacitor and the charge on each capacitor is true?",

    "choices": [
      {

      {
        "label": "Only the charge on each capacitor will change, because the ratio of potential differences across the capacitors will remain the same.",

      {
