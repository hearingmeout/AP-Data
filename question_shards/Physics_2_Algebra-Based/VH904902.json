    "question": "The dielectric is now removed from capacitor <math alttext=\"Z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>Z</mi></mrow></math>, and the circuit is again allowed to reach steady state. Which of the following statements about the potential difference across each capacitor and the charge on each capacitor is true?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Neither will change, because the total potential difference across the capacitors is the same.",

      {
        "label": "Only the charge on each capacitor will change, because the ratio of potential differences across the capacitors will remain the same.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Only the potential difference across each capacitor will change, because the charges on the capacitors must still be equal to each other.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Both will change, because the charge on each capacitor will change due to the change in total capacitance.",

    ],
    "answer": "Both will change, because the charge on each capacitor will change due to the change in total capacitance."
