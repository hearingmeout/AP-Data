    "question": "A student has parallel plate capacitors with the same plate separation and dielectric material, but different known plate areas. The student wants to experimentally determine the effect of plate area on capacitance. The student connects each capacitor in the circuit shown above. Which of the following indicates quantities to be measured that will provide useful information and explains why the information is useful?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Current in the circuit and potential difference across the resistor immediately after the switch is closed, because that will indicate how much charge the capacitor can store.",
