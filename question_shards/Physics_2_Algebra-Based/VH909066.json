    "question": "A student has a collection of resistors made of the same material and wants to experimentally determine the effect of a resistor’s geometry on its resistance. The student connects each different resistor in the circuit shown above, using the same other components. Which of the following indicates quantities to measure that will provide useful information and explains why the information is useful?",
