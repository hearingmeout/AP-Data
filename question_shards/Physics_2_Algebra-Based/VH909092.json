    "question": "A student connects the circuit shown above and measures the values shown for three currents. The student indicates that each value has a measurement error of <math alttext=\"plus or minus 0.2 amperes\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>±</mo><mn>0.2</mn><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mtext> </mtext><mi>A</mi></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math>. Can the information be used as evidence for conservation of charge, and why or why not?",

      {
        "label": "Yes, because the sum of the currents in the two branches equals the current through the battery, within measurement error.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the total current must be measured on the other side of the battery, near where the currents in the two branches come together.",

    "answer": "Yes, because the sum of the currents in the two branches equals the current through the battery, within measurement error."
