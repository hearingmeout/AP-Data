    "question": "A voltmeter must be connected in parallel with a circuit component to correctly measure the potential difference across the component. Which of the following explains why the voltmeter should have a very large resistance?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "A large resistance is needed to make sure the voltmeter has the same current through it as the circuit component, so the potential difference across the voltmeter is the same as that across the component.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A large resistance is needed to make sure a large current passes through the voltmeter, so the rest of the circuit is not affected.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A large resistance is needed to make sure negligible current passes through the voltmeter, so the rest of the circuit is not affected.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A large resistance is needed to make sure the current through the voltmeter has the same nonnegligible value whenever it is used, regardless of the current in the rest of the circuit.",
        "image": null
      }

    "answer": "A large resistance is needed to make sure negligible current passes through the voltmeter, so the rest of the circuit is not affected."
