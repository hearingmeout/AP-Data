Classmates gave the student the above data that show the charge on the equivalent capacitance in a circuit as additional identical capacitors are added to the circuit, but the classmates did not indicate whether the capacitors were added in series or parallel. What evidence from the data can be used to determine whether the capacitors were added in series or parallel?",
