    "question": "A student must determine the resistance of a circuit component. In addition to the component, the student has a battery of known <math alttext=\"e m f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>e</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, an ammeter, and five identical resistors, and connects the circuit shown above. The box represents the component. The student starts with one resistor in the circuit, then adds one resistor at a time in series, recording the current in the circuit each time. The graph shows the student’s data. The student then does a best-fit curve to the data. How can the curve be used to determine the resistance of the component?",
