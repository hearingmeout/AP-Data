    "question": "A student is analyzing results from several experiments where electrons were projected at various orientations near wires that could carry current. Which of the following, where the heavy line is the wire, shows a path for the electrons that would correspond to an experiment where the electrons were projected parallel to a current-carrying wire?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a wire with a helical path that shows the electrons moving in circles around the wire as they travel along the wire.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a wire with an electron path that shows the electrons moving up and to the right above the wire. The path is concave up so that its slope increases as the electron moves away from the wire below.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a wire and an electron path that moves steadily upward and to the right above the wire. The path is linear and to the right.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a wire and an electron path that is above and moving parallel to the wire.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The figure presents a wire with an electron path that shows the electrons moving up and to the right above the wire. The path is concave up so that its slope increases as the electron moves away from the wire below."
