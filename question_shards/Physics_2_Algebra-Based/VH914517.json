    "question": "An initially neutral and non-polarized conducting rod is moving to the right at a constant speed <math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> through a large region that has a uniform magnetic field, as shown above. Which of the following statements correctly describes the motion of the particles within the rod and the resulting charge separation in the rod caused by this motion?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Positively charged particles within the rod moved downward, causing the bottom of the rod to have a positive charge and the top to have a negative charge.",
