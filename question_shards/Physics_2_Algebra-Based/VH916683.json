    "question": "A student has a small disc of unmagnetized iron and places it close to the north pole of a magnet. In the figures below, the arrows represent the alignment of the magnetic fields of domains in the disc. Which of the figures best represents the alignment of the domains before and after the disc is placed near the magnet?",
