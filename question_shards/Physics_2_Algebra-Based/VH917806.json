      {
        "label": "The ammeter needle remains at zero.",

        "label": "The ammeter needle deflects in one direction as the magnet approaches, passes through, and moves away from the loop.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The ammeter needle deflects in one direction as the north end of the magnet approaches the loop, returns to zero when the center of the magnet is in the loop, and deflects in the same direction when the south end of the magnet is moving away from the loop.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The ammeter needle deflects in one direction as the north end of the magnet approaches the loop, returns to zero when the center of the magnet is in the loop, and deflects in the other direction when the south end of the magnet is moving away from the loop.",
