    "question": "Is there a force exerted by the magnet on the loop as the magnet falls through it? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "No. Because the loop is not magnetized, it will not be affected by the magnet.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No. Because the loop is not moving, there are no forces on it.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes. Because the magnetic field due to current in the loop exerts a force on the magnet, the magnet also exerts a force on the loop.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes. Because gravity acts on the loop, the magnet must exert a force on the loop to keep it at rest.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes. Because the magnetic field due to current in the loop exerts a force on the magnet, the magnet also exerts a force on the loop."
