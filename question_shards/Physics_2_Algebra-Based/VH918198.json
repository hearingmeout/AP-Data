    "question": "A sphere with net charge <math alttext=\"positive q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> hangs vertically from a spring scale, as shown above. There is a vertical wire to the left of the sphere. The current in the wire can be switched on or off. Students want to determine the direction of the current in the wire when it is switched on using only the apparatus shown above. Which of the following measurements could be used to determine the direction of the current?",
