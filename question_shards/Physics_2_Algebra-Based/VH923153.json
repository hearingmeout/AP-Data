    "question": "Tape 1\n Tape 2\n\nPositively charged object\n Attracted\n Repelled\n\nNegatively charged object\n Repelled\n Attracted\n\nUncharged object\n Attracted\n Attracted\n\nTwo pieces of transparent adhesive tape, labeled 1 and 2, are stuck together. The pieces of tape are then quickly pulled apart and stuck to an insulating rod, as shown above. Three objects are brought near each piece of tape, one at a time. One of the objects is positively charged, one is negatively charged, and one is uncharged. The reaction of each piece of tape is recorded in the table above. Based on the results, what can be concluded about the signs of the charges on the tapes, and why?",
