    "question": "A beam of electrons is incident on a crystal, creating a diffraction pattern. How should the speed of the electrons be changed to increase the separation of the spacing of the maxima in the pattern, and why would the pattern change?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The speed should be increased, because that would increase the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The speed should be increased, because that would decrease the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons.",
