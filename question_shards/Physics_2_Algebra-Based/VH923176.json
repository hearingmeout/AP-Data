    "question": "A canister and the hydrogen gas it contains are at <math alttext=\"100 degrees Celsius\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. The canister is placed in a vacuum, and the temperature of the canister and gas begins to decrease. Which of the following statements of reasoning best explains how the canister-gas system loses energy?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "High-energy hydrogen molecules collide with lower-energy molecules and the walls inside the canister, losing energy during the collisions.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The molecules collide with the walls of the canister, causing the canister molecules to vibrate and carry energy from the canister to the canister’s surroundings.",

      {
        "label": "Energy is released from the canister as infrared radiation that can travel through the vacuum, causing a decrease in the average energy of the canister and the molecules.",
