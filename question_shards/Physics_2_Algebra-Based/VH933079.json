    "question": "An unmagnetized iron bar has a pivot through its center. The iron bar is held in place as the south pole of a bar magnet is brought near one end of the iron bar, as shown in the figure. If the iron bar is released so it is free to rotate about the pivot, in which direction, if any, will it rotate, and why?",
