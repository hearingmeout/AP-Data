    "question": "Conducting spheres 1 and 2 are on insulated stands and are placed close to each other, as shown in the figure. The spheres are initially uncharged, and sphere 1 is connected to ground. A rod carrying positive charge is brought near the right side of sphere 2. The ground is disconnected and then the rod is removed. Which of the following represents the resulting charge distribution on the two spheres?",
