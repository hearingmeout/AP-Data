    "question": "The dashed line in the figure is equidistant from two positively charged plates. A small positively charged object is placed at point <math alttext=\"P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>P</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> and released from rest. Assuming gravitational effects are negligible, which of the following correctly predicts how the kinetic energy of the object will change, if at all, after it is released?",
