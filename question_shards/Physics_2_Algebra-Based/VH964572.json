    "question": "A student makes the claim that when one end of an uncharged iron rod is brought near a charged glass sphere, one end of the rod becomes positively charged and the other end becomes negatively charged, resulting in a net charge on the rod. Which of the following provides evidence that the rod still does not have a net charge?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The ends of the rod will attract or repel a small metal sphere.",
