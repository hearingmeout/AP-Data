    "question": "An electroscope with two gold leaves is connected to an uncharged metal can. Initially, the gold leaves of the electroscope are hanging vertically downward and touching. When a probe with an unknown charge is lowered into the middle of the can without touching the can, the gold leaves separate, as shown in the figure. The wire to the electroscope is then cut, and the electroscope is moved far away from the can. A second conducting probe with no net charge is then brought near the isolated electroscope, and the gold leaves are observed to be attracted to the probe. Are these observations sufficient to determine the sign of the charge on the first probe that was lowered into the can? Why or why not?",
