    "question": "A neutral metal ball is suspended from a light insulating string and hangs vertically downward. A negatively charged rod is brought near the metal ball, and the metal ball is observed to move toward the negatively charged rod. Which of the following best describes the observed behavior of the neutral metal ball?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The metal ball gains positive charges from the string, which attract the negative charges in the rod.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The neutral charges in the sphere and the negative charges in the rod are opposite and therefore attract.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The negatively charged rod induces charge separation within the metal ball, so the side of the ball closest to the rod is positively charged.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The negatively charged rod has more charge than the neutral metal ball and exerts a large attractive force on the metal ball.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The negatively charged rod induces charge separation within the metal ball, so the side of the ball closest to the rod is positively charged."
