    "question": "Students want to figure out which force, the gravitational force or the electric force, has more impact at different scales in the universe. They choose two scenarios: a hydrogen atom consisting of a proton and an electron, and a solar system consisting of a star and a single planet. Which of the following best describes which force has more impact at each of these two scales?",
