    "question": "A system consists of two uncharged metal spheres, each suspended on an insulating string and connected to the other by a thin conducting wire. A positively charged rod is brought near, but does not touch, the left sphere, and the sphere is attracted to the rod. Which of the following is correct about the net charge on the right sphere as a result?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The right sphere is still uncharged.",

      {
        "label": "The right sphere has a negative charge.",
