    "question": "A student conducts an experiment with tiny charged oil drops suspended in an observation chamber. One individual oil drop is found to have a net charge of <math alttext=\"\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow></mrow></mstyle></math><math alttext=\"negative 3.2 times 10 to the power negative 19 coulombs\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3.2</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>19</mn></mrow></msup><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. While suspended, the drop is seen to split into two smaller drops, which immediately move horizontally away from each other. One drop has an acceleration that is three times the acceleration of the other drop. The student claims that one drop has a charge of <math alttext=\"negative 0.8 times 10 to the power negative 19 coulombs\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.8</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>19</mn></mrow></msup><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and the other drop has a charge of <math alttext=\"negative 2.4 times 10 to the power negative 19 coulombs\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>2.4</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>19</mn></mrow></msup><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, a ratio of three to one, to account for the different accelerations. Is the student’s conclusion reasonable? Why or why not?",
