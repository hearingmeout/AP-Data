    "question": "A particle with a small electric charge is moved in an electric field by an external force. When the particle is moved along an electric potential isoline, in what direction, if any, is the force exerted by the electric field on the particle?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "In the same direction as the particle’s motion",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Opposite to the direction of the particle’s motion",

      {
        "label": "Perpendicular to the direction of the particle’s motion",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "In no direction, since no force is exerted on a particle moving parallel to an isoline",
        "image": null
