The direction of the wave’s motion before it hits the barrier is represented by a vertical arrow that points upward, and is below and perpendicular to the barrier. There are horizontal lines below the barrier that represent wave fronts, which are parallel to each other and to the barrier, and extend to the right farther than the end of the barrier. Shorter horizontal, parallel wave fronts continue past the right side of the barrier, with a vertical arrow that points upward to show their direction of motion.  There are no lines in the region behind the barrier.",

The left end of these wave fronts connect to parallel wave fronts behind the barrier that are at a 45 degree angle. An arrow directed up and to the right shows the direction of motion of these wave fronts.",
