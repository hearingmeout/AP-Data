The direction of the wave’s motion before it hits the barrier is represented by a vertical arrow that points upward, and is below and perpendicular to the barrier.

Shorter horizontal, parallel wave fronts continue past the right side of the barrier, with a vertical arrow that points upward to show their direction of motion.  There are no lines in the region behind the barrier.",
