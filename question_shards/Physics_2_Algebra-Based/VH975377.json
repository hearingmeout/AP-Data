    "description": "The figure shows a cylindrical tube that is closed at both ends. There is a piston in the tube that can slide with negligible friction and is attached to the left end of the tube by a spring. The left half of the tube contains a mixture of one mole of atomic helium gas (with mass <math alttext=\"4 atomic mass units\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>amu</mtext></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>) and one mole of atomic argon gas (with mass <math alttext=\"40 atomic mass units\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>amu</mtext></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>). The right half of the tube contains a vacuum. Initially, the gas mixture is in thermal equilibrium with the surroundings and the piston is in the center of the tube.",
