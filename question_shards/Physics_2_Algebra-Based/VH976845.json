    "question": "A student has a small metal sphere that hangs from an insulating string. In seeking to determine the charge on the sphere, the student brings a positively charged rod near the sphere and finds that the sphere is attracted to the rod. The student then brings a negatively charged rod near the sphere and finds that the sphere is repelled by the rod. Which of the following conclusions, if any, can be drawn from the results?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The sphere must be negatively charged.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The sphere must be positively charged.",
