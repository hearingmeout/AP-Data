    "question": "The rod is removed from the apparatus and placed in a warm room until it reaches thermal equilibrium. Its ends are then positioned to touch the ends of an identical rod with a much colder temperature, as shown in the figure. Which of the following is the best explanation of how energy is transferred between the rods as they approach thermal equilibrium?",
