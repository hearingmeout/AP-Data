The rod is 1 <math alttext=\"meter\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>m</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> long and 2 <math alttext=\"centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>cm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> in diameter.

    "question": "The rod is removed from the apparatus and placed in a warm room until it reaches thermal equilibrium. Its ends are then positioned to touch the ends of an identical rod with a much colder temperature, as shown in the figure. Which of the following is the best explanation of how energy is transferred between the rods as they approach thermal equilibrium?",
