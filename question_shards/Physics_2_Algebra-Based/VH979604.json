    "question": "Some students want to investigate the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas. They take a sealed, thin-walled metal can full of air, place it in a vat of liquid nitrogen, and observe that the can collapses. Another student says that their procedure is a better demonstration of the effect of temperature on another property of the gas. Which of the following properties of the gas does the procedure best relate to temperature?",
