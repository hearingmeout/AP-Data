    "question": "One mole of an ideal gas is sealed in a cylinder with a moveable piston. The temperature of the gas inside the cylinder increases from <math alttext=\"0 degrees Celsius \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"100 degrees Celsius \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> as the gas expands, as shown in the figure. Which of the following correctly justifies the change, if any, of the internal energy of the gas?",
