Let <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> be the weight of the piston, <math alttext=\"F sub P \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> be the force the piston exerts on the gas, and <math alttext=\"F sub A \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> be the force the atmosphere exerts on the piston. Which of the following best indicates the forces on the piston?",
