    "question": "In a movie set in space, a planet explodes, simultaneously producing a bright flash of light and a loud boom. The director of the movie wants to depict how people in a spaceship that is speeding away from the planet would perceive the explosion. Which of the following best explains what the people should perceive?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The light and sound should both be perceived but with a lower frequency than was produced, because the spaceship is moving away from the source.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The light should be perceived but the sound should not, because light is an electromagnetic wave while sound is a mechanical wave.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The light and sound should be perceived simultaneously, because light and sound travel the same distance from the explosion to the spaceship.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The light should be perceived before the sound, because light propagates faster than sound.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The light should be perceived but the sound should not, because light is an electromagnetic wave while sound is a mechanical wave."
