    "question": "A laser is directed toward a pair of identical linear polarizing filters with unknown orientation. The intensity of laser light that passes through both filters is measured by a sensor. In order for the orientation of the filters to be determined, filter 2 is rotated through <math alttext=\"360 degrees\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mn>360</mn><mi>°</mi></mrow></math> from its initial orientation. The graph plots the resulting intensity data as a function of the angle of rotation. Which of the following explains how to determine the orientation of filter 1 ?",
