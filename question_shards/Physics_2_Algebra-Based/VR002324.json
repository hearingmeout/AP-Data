    "question": "A student is holding one end of a spring. The other end of the spring is attached to a metal ring, as shown, that can slide freely along a vertical rod. The student creates one wave on the spring, and the ring moves up and down the rod. The student creates a second wave, and the ring does not move. Which of the following can be concluded about the two waves and their polarizations?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The first wave is transverse and polarized vertically. The second wave is transverse and polarized vertically.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The first wave is transverse and polarized vertically. The second wave is longitudinal.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The first wave is transverse and is not polarized horizontally. The second wave is transverse and polarized horizontally.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The first wave is transverse and is not polarized horizontally. The second wave could be either longitudinal or transverse and polarized horizontally.",

    "answer": "The first wave is transverse and is not polarized horizontally. The second wave could be either longitudinal or transverse and polarized horizontally."
