The other end of the string is attached to a metal ring, as shown, that can slide freely on a vertical rod. The student creates a transverse wave that travels along the string. The student changes the amplitude of the wave and measures the amplitude of the motion of the ring. The data are shown in the table. Based on this data, what can be concluded about the polarization of the wave on the string?",
