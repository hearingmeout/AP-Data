    "question": "Light travels across a boundary from material 1 to material 2, causing a change in the path of the light ray at the boundary of the two media. The angle of incidence <math alttext=\"theta sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> and the angle of refraction <math alttext=\"theta sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> are measured, and the graph shown is created from the data. Based on the graph, which of the following diagrams best represents a possible path of a light ray?",

A solid horizontal line is drawn, and the top section is labeled Material 1, and the bottom section is labeled Material 2. A dashed vertical line bisects the solid horizontal line. Two arrows represents the light ray as it travels from Material 1 to Material 2. The first arrow moves downward and to the right, and touches the intersection of the solid and dashed lines. From the intersection of the solid and dashed lines, the second arrow moves downward and to the right at the same angle as the first arrow. In Material 1, the angle formed by the first arrow and the dashed vertical line is labeled theta sub 1. In Material 2, the angle formed by the second arrow and the dashed vertical line is labeled theta sub 2.",
