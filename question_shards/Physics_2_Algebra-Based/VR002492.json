    "question": "Two tin cans are attached by a horizontal string that is pulled taught, as shown. When a student speaks into the can on the left, the student’s voice can be heard in the can on the right, because the disturbance caused by the student’s voice is carried by a wave that travels the length of the string from the left to the right. Which of the following best describes the wave that carries the student’s voice?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The wave is a longitudinal wave, because the molecules in the string oscillate up and down.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The wave is a longitudinal wave, because the molecules in the string oscillate right and left.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The wave is a transverse wave, because the molecules in the string oscillate up and down.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The wave is a transverse wave, because the molecules in the string oscillate right and left.",
