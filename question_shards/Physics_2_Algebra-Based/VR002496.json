    "question": "A wave on a string approaches a piece of cardboard and passes through a narrow slit in the cardboard. The wave has amplitude <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as it approaches the slit, which is much longer than <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> . The wave on the other side of the slit has amplitude <math alttext=\"A over 3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> . Which of the following could explain why the amplitude <math alttext=\"A over 3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math> on the other side of the slit is smaller?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The wave is polarized vertically and the slit is aligned horizontally, so the amplitude would be reduced.",

        "label": "The wave is polarized vertically and the slit is aligned vertically, but the finite width of the slit means only some of the wave will pass through the slit.",

        "label": "The wave is polarized horizontally and the slit is aligned vertically, so only vertical components of the wave pass through the slit.",

      {
        "label": "The wave is polarized at some angle between horizontal and vertical, and the slit is aligned vertically, so only the vertical component of the wave will pass through the slit.",
