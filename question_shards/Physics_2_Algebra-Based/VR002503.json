    "question": "A student shines a laser at a diffraction grating and observes a pattern of dots on a wall behind the grating. The student then puts a second laser at the same location as the first and shines it at the diffraction grating. A new pattern of dots is observed on the wall behind the grating. The second laser emitted light of equal brightness, and shorter wavelength. How will the pattern of dots on the wall generated by the second laser compare to that generated by the first laser?",
