    "question": "In an experiment to investigate the photoelectric effect, monochromatic light is shined on a metal plate. Electrons emitted from the metal move across a vacuum to a collector plate, as shown in the diagram. As the potential difference of the power supply increases, the number of electrons detected by the ammeter decreases. The potential difference is increased until it reaches <math alttext=\"V sub s\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, at which no electrons reach the collector plate. When the potential difference is set to <math alttext=\"V sub s\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> , which of the following claims is correct about the emitted electrons?",
