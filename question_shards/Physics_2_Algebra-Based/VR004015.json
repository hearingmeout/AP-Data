    "question": "A beam of electrons, all with the same speed, is incident on a crystal whose atoms are at a fixed spacing. The electrons then strike a detection screen, resulting in a diffraction pattern with alternating areas of minimum/maximum intensity similar to a double slit interference pattern. If the potential difference used to accelerate the electrons is increased, which of the following predictions is correct about the spacing between the maxima change?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The spacing decreases because as potential difference increases, so do the kinetic energy and momentum of the electrons, resulting in a longer wavelength.",
