    "question": "A beam of electrons that all have the same speed is directed at a pair of slits, and forms an interference pattern. The figure represents the electron waves before and after encountering the slits. Which of the following correctly compares the intensity of electrons measured by a detector along each of the labeled arrows?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The intensity is greater along 1 and 2 than along 3 and 4.",
