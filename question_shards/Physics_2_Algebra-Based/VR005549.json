    "question": "An electron beam is projected at a crystal, as shown in the diagram. The signal on the other side of the crystal is recorded on a screen. A student claims this is evidence that the electrons can exhibit wave properties. Which of the following statements justifies the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "A signal from the electrons passes through the crystal.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pattern of signal intensity on the screen has bright and dark areas.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pattern of the signal intensity on the screen is similar to the interference pattern of electromagnetic radiation passing through narrow slits.",
