    "question": "In a demonstration of the double slit experiment, a high velocity stream of dense spheres is fired at a slit , and another stream is fired at an adjacent identical slit. For each stream, all spheres pass straight through the slit, then hit the same location on a screen. Next, two streams of electrons are fired at two slits next to one another. On a screen beyond the slits, a diffraction pattern is formed. Which situation does classical mechanics explain, and which situation does quantum mechanics explain?",
