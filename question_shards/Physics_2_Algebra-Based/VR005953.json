    "question": "Electrons are accelerated through a potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and are then incident on a crystal. The resulting diffraction pattern is observed on a screen. If the potential difference is then decreased, the spacing between maxima of the diffraction pattern increases. Does this increase in spacing support the wave model of matter, and why or why not?",
