    "question": "Some students observe that a hollow metal sphere hanging on an insulating string is attracted to a positively charged rod. They decide that this is evidence that the sphere could also be charged. The answer to which of the following questions might determine whether they are correct?",

      {
        "label": "Is the sphere still attracted when the positively charged rod is placed on the other side of the sphere?",
