    "question": "The system in the figure above consists of a conducting bar moving with negligible friction along a pair of stationary parallel conducting rails that are connected to a light bulb, forming a circuit. The rails are slightly tilted from horizontal, and the system is in a uniform magnetic field <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> that is perpendicular to the plane of the rails and pointing up. As the bar slides downward along the rails, a current is induced that causes the bulb to light. Which of the following statements is true about the energy in the system or the forces exerted on the sliding bar?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy of the circuit-magnetic field-Earth system is converted only to kinetic energy of the sliding bar.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The gravitational potential energy of the circuit-magnetic field-Earth system increases due to the work done by the magnetic field on the moving bar.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The motion of the bar is determined by the magnetic force due to the induced current and a component of the force of gravity, which are in the same direction.",

      {
        "label": "The motion of the bar is determined by the magnetic force due to the induced current and a component of the force of gravity, which are in opposite directions.",

    ],
    "answer": "The motion of the bar is determined by the magnetic force due to the induced current and a component of the force of gravity, which are in opposite directions."
