(12 points, suggested time 25 minutes) Students use a lightbulb, a screen, and a meterstick to determine the focal length of a concave mirror from a graph. (a) i. Describe a procedure that could be used to collect appropriate data and the measurements to be taken. Label the axes below with the quantities to be graphed. Draw a clearly labeled diagram of the experimental setup. Describe the procedure and indicate the quantities to be measured. ii. Describe how the focal length can be determined from the graph.",

They measure the temperature of the air in front of the mirror along the principal axis and graph the air temperature as a function of distance from the mirror. The graph below is their best-fit curve to the data. i. Based on the curve, at what distance from the mirror would you expect to find the image of the Sun? ii. Use a relevant equation to explain how your response to (c)(i) relates to the focal length of the mirror.",
