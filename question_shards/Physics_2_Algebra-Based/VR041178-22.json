A horizontal beam of protons with a variety of speeds enters the region, as shown above. Protons exit the region at a variety of locations, including points 1 and 2 shown on the figure. In a coherent, paragraph-length response, explain why some protons exit the region at point 1 and others exit at point 2. Use physics principles to explain your reasoning.",
