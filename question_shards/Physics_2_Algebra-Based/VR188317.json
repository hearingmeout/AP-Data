    "question": "A student has two lenses. One lens is a converging lens, and the other is a diverging lens. The student is attempting to focus the image of a lightbulb onto a movable screen by allowing light from the bulb to pass through just one of the lenses. Which lens should the student use, and at what distance from the bulb should the student place the lens, to clearly focus the image onto the screen?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The converging lens, at a distance less than the focal length of the lens",
