The horizontal axis is labeled “Volume, in liters,” and the numbers 0 through 1.5, in increments of 0.5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Pressure, in kilopascals,” and the numbers 0 through 600, in increments of 100, are indicated. The lower leftmost vertex of the cycle is at the point representing 0.4 liter and 240 kilopascals. The cycle moves counterclockwise as follows. From the lower left vertex, a concave upward curve extends downward and to the right, ending at 0.6 liters and approximately 155 kilopascals. From there a horizontal line extends rightward to 1.2 liters. Then, a concave upward curve extends upward and to the left until it ends at 0.4 liter and approximately 475 kilopascals. Finally, a vertical line extends downward to the lower leftmost vertex.",
