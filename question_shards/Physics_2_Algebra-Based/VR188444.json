    "question": "A beam of electrons moves to the right with speed <math alttext=\"lowercase v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> between two conducting plates and parallel to a wire with current <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> directed to the right, as shown above. The bottom plate is grounded <math alttext=\"V sub B equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>, and the top plate has potential <math alttext=\"V sub T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>. Several values of <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> are used. For each value, the potential <math alttext=\"V sub T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> of the top plate is adjusted until the beam is undeflected while it is between the plates. A graph of <math alttext=\"V sub T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is shown. The procedure is repeated, but <math alttext=\"V sub T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> is fixed and the speed <math alttext=\"lowercase v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of the electrons is adjusted to keep the beam undeflected. Which of the following graphs correctly shows <math alttext=\"lowercase v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> for the new procedure?",
