    "question": "A positively charged particle is moving with a constant speed in the plane of the page and directed to the right. It enters the region between two parallel plates that are perpendicular to the page and have equal and opposite charges, as shown above. If gravitational effects are negligible, which of the following describes the path of the particle when it is between the plates?",
