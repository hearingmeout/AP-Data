After the collision, the electron moves toward the top of the page and to the right, as shown above on the right, at a known speed and angle. In a coherent, paragraph-length response, indicate a possible direction for the photon that exists after the collision and its frequency compared to that of the original photon. Describe the application of physics principles that can be used to determine the direction of motion and frequency of the photon that exists after the collision.",
