(10 points, suggested time 15 minutes)\n\nFour point charges, A, B, C, and D, are located at the centers of the sides of a square, as shown above. The charges have the values indicated in the figure. Each charge is held in place by an external force. Point P is at the center of the square.\n\n(a) The magnitude of the electric field at point P due to charge A is <math alttext=\"E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. Describe the magnitude and direction of the net electric field resulting from all four charges at point P in terms of <math alttext=\"E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and the coordinate axes shown.
