    "question": "This question is a short free-response question. Show your work for each part of the question. (10 points, suggested time 15 minutes) Four point charges, W, X, Y, and Z, are located at the centers of the sides of a square, shown above. The charges have the values indicated in the figure. Each charge is held in place by an external force. Point P is at the center of the square. (a) The magnitude of the electric field at point P due to charge Y is <math alttext=\"E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. Describe the magnitude and direction of the net electric field resulting from all four charges at point P in terms of <math alttext=\"E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and the coordinate axes shown. Briefly explain your reasoning.",
