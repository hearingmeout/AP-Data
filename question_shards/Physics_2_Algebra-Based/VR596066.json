    "question": "The switch is open and the capacitor is uncharged. A second resistor is added to the circuit, connected between <math alttext=\"X\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"Y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as shown above. How does the potential difference across Resistor <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>R</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> immediately after the switch is closed compare to that in the original circuit, immediately after the switch is closed?",
