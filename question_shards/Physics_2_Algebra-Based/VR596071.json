    "description": "A sample of a radioactive substance is placed near a small screen with an opening that separates the sample from a region of uniform magnetic field directed into the page, as shown above. The opening is small, so any decay products that pass through are initially traveling horizontally toward the right. The half-life of the substance is <math alttext=\"15\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> minutes.",
    "question": "If some of the decay products are electrons, in what direction will the electrons entering the magnetic field initially be deflected?",
