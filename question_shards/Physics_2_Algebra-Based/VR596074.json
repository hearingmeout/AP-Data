    "question": "On a dry day, a person runs a plastic comb through their dog’s hair. They notice that the dog’s hair tends to stand on end after using the comb. Which of the following best explains why this happens?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Because of the friction between the comb and hair, the hair acquires a negative charge, but the comb does not acquire a net charge.",

      {
        "label": "Because of the friction between the comb and hair, both acquire a negative charge.",
