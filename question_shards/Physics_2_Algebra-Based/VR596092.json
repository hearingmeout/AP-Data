    "question": "To investigate the propagation of light and sound waves, a scientist proposes an experiment to set off a bright and loud explosion on the Moon and then use sensitive instruments on the surface of Earth to measure the arrival times of the light and sound waves from the explosion. Which of the following statements correctly predicts and explains the results of this experiment?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will be detected a few seconds later because sound propagates at the same speed as light in the vacuum of space but slower than light in Earth’s atmosphere.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will be detected much later because sound propagates much slower than light for the entire distance from the Moon to Earth.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will never be detected because sound waves cannot propagate in the vacuum of space between the Moon and Earth.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Neither the light nor the sound will ever be detected because neither can propagate in the vacuum of space between the Moon and Earth.",

    "answer": "The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will never be detected because sound waves cannot propagate in the vacuum of space between the Moon and Earth."
