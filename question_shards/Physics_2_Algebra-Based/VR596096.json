    "question": "A circular loop of wire is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> directed out of the page, as shown. The magnitude of the magnetic field is decreased to zero at a steady rate over a period of time. Which of the following correctly describes the current in the wire while the field is changing?",
