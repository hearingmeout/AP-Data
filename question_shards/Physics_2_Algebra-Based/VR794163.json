    "description": "The resistivity of a particular material is known to increase with temperature. The material is used to make a cylindrical resistor and is connected to a battery with potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi> <mi>V</mi> </math>. While the resistor is connected to the battery, the temperature of the resistor slowly increases.",
    "question": "Which of the following correctly indicates how the current in the battery and the resistance of the resistor change, if at all, while the temperature is increasing?\n\nCurrent in Battery\n Resistance of Resistor\n\nA\n Increase\n Increase\n\nB\n Increase\n Stay the same\n\nC\n Decrease\n Increase\n\nD\n Decrease\n Stay the same",
