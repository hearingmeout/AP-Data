    "description": "Two parallel circular plates are separated by a distance <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>d</mi> </math> and are slightly overlapping in area, as shown. The plates are placed in a circuit and charged until there is a potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></math> between the plates. The plates are then disconnected from the circuit. While keeping the distance <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> between the plates constant, the bottom plate is moved upward so the amount that the plates overlap increases.",
    "question": "Which of the following correctly indicates how the capacitance and the potential difference between the plates changes as the bottom plate is moved?\n\nCapacitance\n Potential Difference\n\nA\n Decreases\n Decreases\n\nB\n Decreases\n Increases\n\nC\n Increases\n Decreases\n\nD\n Increases\n Increases",
