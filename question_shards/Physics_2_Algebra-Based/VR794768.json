    "description": "A circular loop is placed in a magnetic field of unknown orientation. The initial magnetic flux through the loop is nonzero. The loop is then rotated <math alttext=\"180 degrees\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <msup> <mn>180</mn> <mo>∘</mo> </msup> </math> about an axis in the plane of the loop and through the loop’s center.",
    "question": "Which of the following correctly compares the magnitude and sign of the magnetic flux after the loop has been rotated to those of the original flux?\n\nMagnitude of flux\n Sign of flux\n\nA\n The same\n The same\n\nB\n The same\n Opposite sign\n\nC\n Less\n The same\n\nD\n Less\n Opposite sign",
