The points 2 f that are two principal focal lengths away from the lens are also indicated to the left and to the right of the lens along the axis. Two light rays are shown moving from left to right above the axis toward the lens. The rays are horizontal and parallel until they reach point 2 f to the left of the lens. From there, they both move downward and to the right, but the upper ray slopes downward more steeply than the lower ray so that the gap between them slowly decreases until they intersect at point f to the right of the lens. They continue downward and to the right on their respective trajectories so that the ray that started out above the other ray now travels below, and the gap between them increases as they move to the right.",
