The vertical axis is labeled “Intensity,” and no values are indicated. The curve is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis. It consists of a tall central peak, followed by three peaks to the left and right of the central peak. Each of the successive peaks is much shorter than the central peak, and they grow shorter as they get further from the vertical axis. The curve covers approximately three quarters of the total length of the horizontal axis.",
