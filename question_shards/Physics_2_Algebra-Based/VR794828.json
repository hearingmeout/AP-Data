    "question": "Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nStudents are given a clear, rigid cylindrical container that is sealed with a movable piston. The piston slides with negligible friction and can be locked in place. The container is filled with one mole of a gas and can be placed in a cold-water bath to keep the temperature of the gas constant. The students have access to a meterstick and a pressure sensor that can be placed inside the container. They are asked to determine if the relationship between the pressure and the volume of the gas is consistent with the ideal gas law.\n\n(a) Describe an experimental procedure the students could use to collect the data needed to determine if the relationship between the pressure and the volume of the gas is consistent with the ideal gas law. Provide enough detail so that another student could replicate the experiment, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty.",
