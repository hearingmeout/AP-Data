    "question": "The figures show two different capacitors made of identical parallel conducting plates. In Capacitor <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, the plates are separated by a distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> and a block of material with dielectric constant <math alttext=\"kappa\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>κ</mi></math> is inserted between the plates. In Capacitor <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, the plates are separated by a distance <math alttext=\"2 d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mi>d</mi></math> and two identical blocks of material with dielectric constant <math alttext=\"kappa\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>κ</mi></math> are inserted between the plates. A student claims that the capacitance of Capacitor <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> is the same as that of Capacitor <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. Which of the following indicates whether the claim is correct or incorrect, and provides a valid justification?",

      {
        "label": "Correct, because the effects of doubling the distance between the plates and doubling the volume of the dielectric cancel each other.",
