    "question": "A diver is swimming underwater in a pool filled with water. An observer is standing at the edge of the pool, as shown. Will the observer always be able to see the diver no matter where the diver is in the pool? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because there will always be a light ray originating from the diver that will refract toward the observer and reach the observer.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because for every position of the diver, there is a straight-line path connecting the diver and the observer.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because light passing from a medium with high index of refraction to low index of refraction will always totally reflect at the boundary between the two media.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because for some positions of the diver some of the light rays from the diver will totally reflect at the water-air boundary.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because there will always be a light ray originating from the diver that will refract toward the observer and reach the observer."
