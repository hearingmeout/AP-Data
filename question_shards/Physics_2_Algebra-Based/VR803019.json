    "question": "An ideal gas at a certain temperature is described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution shown in the figure. The temperature of the gas is then increased. The axes in all figures in this question have the same scales. Which of the following figures represents a possible Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the gas after the increase in temperature?",
