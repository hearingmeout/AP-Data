    "question": "An ideal gas is inside a rigid container of constant volume that is made from a thermally conductive material. An open flame is brought near the container, allowing energy to transfer into the gas by heating. Which of the following correctly indicates the change, if any, in the gas pressure, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The pressure increases, because the gas atoms deliver a greater average impulse when colliding with the container walls.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pressure increases, because an increase in temperature always corresponds to an increase in pressure.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pressure stays the same, because the volume of the container does not change.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pressure stays the same, because the same number of gas atoms collide with the container walls every second.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The pressure increases, because the gas atoms deliver a greater average impulse when colliding with the container walls."
