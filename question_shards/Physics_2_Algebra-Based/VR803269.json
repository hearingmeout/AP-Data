    "question": "Two containers, <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>, are made of a thermally conducting material and contain different ideal gases. Container <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> is at a temperature much greater than room temperature, while Container <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math> is at room temperature. The two containers are brought into thermal contact and isolated from their surroundings. Which of the following correctly describes the change in temperature, if any, of the two containers and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "They will stay at their respective temperatures because the two containers have different ideal gases inside them.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "They will stay at their respective temperatures because the entropy of the system is higher when both gases are at different temperatures.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "They will come to the same equilibrium temperature because the gases inside the containers are different ideal gases.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "They will come to the same equilibrium temperature because the entropy of the system is highest when the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "They will come to the same equilibrium temperature because the entropy of the system is highest when the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium."
