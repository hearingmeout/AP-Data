    "question": "Positively charged particles are sent through a region with magnetic and electric fields that are perpendicular to each other, as shown in the figure. Some particles are deflected upward, while others are deflected downward. What is the difference between these two sets of particles?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The particles that are deflected upward have a smaller electric charge.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The particles that are deflected upward have a greater velocity.",
