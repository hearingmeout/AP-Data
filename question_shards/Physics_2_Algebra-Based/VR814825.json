    "question": "A person touches a metal cart with rubber wheels that moves along a carpeted surface. The person feels a shock. Which of the following claims is correct and provides correct justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The shock did not come from the wheels because they are made of rubber, which is an insulator, they cannot be charged by friction with the floor.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The shock did not come from the wheels, because the charges that were created when the wheels rolled along the floor, were destroyed upon contact with the person.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The person could have experienced a shock whether the cart had an excess positive or negative charge because in either case an excess charge will be neutralized when given a path to the ground.",
