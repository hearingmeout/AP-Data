    "question": "A balloon is rubbed on a wool sweater, transferring electrons to the balloon. The balloon is then touched to a nearby neutral wooden door and sticks to the door. Which of the following is a correct justification for why the balloon remains stuck to the door as it slides down to the ground?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The molecules in the door become polarized, with the positively charged end closer to the balloon causing a net attraction.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The normal forces from the balloon and the door combine creating a net upward normal force to balance the force of gravity.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "When the balloon touches the door, some of the electrons from the balloon transfer to the door.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The coefficient of static friction between rubber (the balloon) and wood is large and holds the balloon onto the door regardless of charge.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The molecules in the door become polarized, with the positively charged end closer to the balloon causing a net attraction."
