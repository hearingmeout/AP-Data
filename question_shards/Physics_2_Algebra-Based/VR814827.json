    "question": "A parallel-plate capacitor is connected to a power supply with potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></math>. The area of the plates of the capacitor is doubled while the potential difference of the power supply is halved. A student claims that the charge stored on the capacitor must have increased. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the capacitance increased.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the electric potential decreased.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the distance between the plates remains the same.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the capacitance and electric potential difference both changed.",
