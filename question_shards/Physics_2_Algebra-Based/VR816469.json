    "question": "A closed cylindrical container is filled with a monatomic ideal gas at room temperature. The area of the circular top surface of the container is <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>A</mi></math> and the area of the cylindrical side of the container is <math alttext=\"2 A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mi>A</mi></math>, as indicated in the figure. Which of the following statements about the pressure exerted by the gas on the top and side of the container is correct?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The gas exerts zero pressure on the top and side.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The gas exerts the same nonzero pressure on the top and the side.",
