    "question": "Identical containers <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math> each contain a sample of the same monatomic ideal gas. The two samples have the same temperature but the pressure of the gas in Container <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> is greater than the pressure of the gas in Container <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math>. A student claims that Container <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> must contain more gas atoms than Container <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math>. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the claim is correct or incorrect, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Correct, because the average speed of the gas atoms is the same in both gases and therefore the number of collisions per second of the atoms with the container walls must be greater in Container <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math>.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Correct, because having more gas atoms means that the average speed of the atoms will be greater and each atom in Container <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> will on average exert a greater force on the container walls.",

      {
        "label": "Incorrect, because the gases in both containers are at the same temperature and therefore must have the same number of gas atoms.",

      {
        "label": "Incorrect, because the pressure of the gas in Container <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> is greater and therefore will have fewer collisions per second with the container walls.",
