    "question": "An ideal monatomic gas is initially in State <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and undergoes a thermodynamic process. After the process, the gas is in State <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>. The graph shows the distribution of atomic speeds of the gas in states <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the temperature of the gas increased or decreased, and provides a valid justification?",
