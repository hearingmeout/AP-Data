    "question": "In a sample of a monatomic ideal gas, a particular gas atom has speed <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> at time <math alttext=\"t sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>. At a later time <math alttext=\"t sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>, the gas atom has speed <math alttext=\"v sub 2 equals 2 v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>. Which of the following correctly indicates how the temperature of the gas may have changed, and provides a valid justification?",
