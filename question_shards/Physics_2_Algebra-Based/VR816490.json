    "question": "A hot metal sphere is placed in a vacuum chamber close to, but not touching, a cool metal sphere. The chamber is thermally isolated from the surroundings. After a long time, both metal spheres are at thermal equilibrium with each other. A student claims that no energy was transferred between the spheres. Is the claim correct? Why or why not?",

      {
        "label": "Yes, because energy transfer by conduction requires contact",
