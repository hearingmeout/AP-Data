    "question": "An ideal gas is sealed in a container with a moveable piston and is taken through the isothermal process from State <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> to State <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>, as shown in the <math alttext=\"P V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>PV</mi></math> diagram. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the work done on the gas is positive or negative during the process, and provides a valid justification?",
