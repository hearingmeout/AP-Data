    "question": "In an experiment, a cylindrical rod is held with its ends in thermal contact with hot and cold reservoirs. The difference in temperature <math alttext=\"delta uppercase T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>T</mi></math> between the ends of the rods is varied, and the rate of energy transfer <math alttext=\"the fraction Q over delta lowercase t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>Q</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> is measured. The results are represented in the graph of <math alttext=\"the fraction Q over delta lowercase t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>Q</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"delta uppercase T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>T</mi></math>, with a best-fit line drawn to the data points. In a second experiment, the rod is cut in half and the same procedure is performed. Which of the following correctly predicts how the graph of <math alttext=\"the fraction Q over delta lowercase t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>Q</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> as a function of would compare to the graph for the first experiment?",
