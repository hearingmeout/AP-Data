    "question": "A metal pot is filled with room-temperature water and is then set on a stove. The stove is turned on and the surface in contact with the bottom of the pot is quickly heated to a very high temperature. Which of the following depicts a situation that would increase the time it takes for the water to reach its boiling point?",
