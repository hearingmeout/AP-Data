    "question": "A solid substance is isolated from the surroundings. Energy is then added to the system during a heating process, increasing its temperature just until the substance begins to melt. Which of the following choices correctly compares the entropy of the substance as a solid to the entropy of the substance as it begins melting at the same temperature?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The entropy stays the same.",

      {
        "label": "The entropy as a solid is greater than the entropy as the substance melts.",
