    "question": "A partially inflated bicycle tire is left outside in cold weather. The tire is then brought inside a classroom and warm air is added to the tire. The mixed air in the tire eventually reaches thermal equilibrium. During which of the following times is the entropy of all the air in the bicycle tire at a maximum value?",
