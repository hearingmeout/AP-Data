    "question": "Two closed containers, <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math>, each contain a sample of an ideal gas and are brought into thermal contact, as shown, and the system is isolated from the surroundings. Container <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math> is initially at a higher temperature than Container <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math>. Which of the following is a correct claim about the two-container system after the two containers are brought into thermal contact?",

      {
