    "question": "A closed system consists of two identical metal blocks at different temperatures. Initially, one block has a temperature twice that of the other. The blocks are placed in thermal contact and isolated from their surroundings. A student claims that the entropy of the isolated system increases over time. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the process of reaching thermal equilibrium is irreversible.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the two blocks will continue to cool after reaching thermal equilibrium.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because in a closed system the entropy remains constant.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the system moves toward a more orderly state of uniform temperature",
