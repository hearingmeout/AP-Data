    "question": "A metal rod is briefly brought near two candles so that the ends of the rod are hotter than the middle of the rod. The rod is then thermally isolated from its surroundings. Which of the following correctly indicates how the entropy of the rod changes after it is thermally isolated, and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The entropy stays the same, because the rod is thermally isolated and no energy can transfer to the surroundings",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The entropy stays the same, because the average temperature of the rod will not change",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The entropy increases, because the average temperature of the rod will continue to increase",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The entropy increases, because the thermal energy in the rod becomes less localized and more spread out",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The entropy increases, because the thermal energy in the rod becomes less localized and more spread out"
