    "question": "Bars of initially unmagnetized iron and unmagnetized aluminum are placed in a strong magnetic field directed to the right, as shown in the middle figure. Iron is ferromagnetic, while aluminum is paramagnetic. After leaving the two bars in the field for a long time, the field is removed. Which of the following correctly represents the orientation of the magnetic dipoles inside each of the samples?\nIronAluminumABCD",
