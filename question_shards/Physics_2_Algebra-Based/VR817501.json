    "question": "A wire made of aluminum, which is paramagnetic, has magnetic domains as shown on the left. A permanent magnet is placed near the wire and the magnetic domains in the wire align, as shown on the right. The magnet is then removed. Which of the following best represents the magnetic domains in the wire after the magnet is removed?",
