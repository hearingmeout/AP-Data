    "question": "Two identical bar magnets are brought close together. The magnetic field lines of the two magnets are shown in the figure. A student claims that the poles of the magnets are aligned north pole to north pole. Which of the following correctly states whether the student’s claim is correct and provides a correct justification?",

      {
