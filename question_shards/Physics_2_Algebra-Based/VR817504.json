    "question": "Two bar magnets, <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>, separated from each other, are cut in half along the dashed lines shown in the diagram. Each half of each magnet is kept in its original orientation. Which of the following correctly describes whether the two halves of Magnet <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> attract each other and whether the two halves of Magnet <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math> attract each other and provides a correct justification?",
