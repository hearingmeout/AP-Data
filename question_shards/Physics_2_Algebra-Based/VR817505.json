    "question": "A bar magnet is placed on a table with the north pole facing right and the south pole facing left. A short time later, the bar is cut in half and each piece is separated so that there is a gap between the two pieces as shown. A magnetic compass is placed directly between the two pieces. Which of the following best describes the direction the compass needle will point and provides correct justification?",
