    "question": "A cyclotron consists of two semicircular regions of constant and equal magnetic fields as shown. Particles move in semicircular paths through one region, then cross a gap between the semicircles where there is an electric field oriented such that the particles accelerate, increasing their speed through the gap. The particles continue to move from one region to the other, speeding up each time they pass through the gap and moving through each region in a semicircular path with a larger radius each time. Which of the following correctly compares the magnitude of the magnetic force exerted on the particles and the length of time it takes a particle to complete a half circle as the particle spirals outward through the cyclotron?\nMagnitude of the magnetic forcePeriod of orbitADecreasesIncreasesBRemains the SameRemains the SameCIncreasesRemains the SameDIncreasesDecreases",
