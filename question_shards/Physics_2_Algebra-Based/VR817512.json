    "question": "A proton moves with a constant speed to the right as it enters a region containing a magnetic field directed into the page, as shown. If the proton is replaced with an electron moving at the same speed in the same direction as the proton, which of the following statements best describes the force experienced by the electron due to the magnetic field when compared to the force experienced by the proton?",
