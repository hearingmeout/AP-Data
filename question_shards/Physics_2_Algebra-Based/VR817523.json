    "question": "A current-carrying wire is initially placed perpendicular to a magnetic field directed out of the page, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. The wire is then rotated so that it is parallel to the field with the current directed into the page, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. Which of the following correctly describes the change to the magnetic force exerted on the wire from Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> to Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> and provides correct justification?",
