    "question": "A lightbulb attached to a closed, conducting wire loop moves at a constant speed from Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> to Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math> through a uniform magnetic field directed into the page, as shown. Which of the following correctly describes the behavior of the lightbulb as the loop moves from Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> to Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>, and provides the correct justification?",
