    "question": "A square loop of wire moves to the right toward a uniform magnetic field directed into the page, as shown. As the loop moves into the field but before its left end is entirely inside the field, which of the following correctly describes the direction of the current induced in the wire and provides the correct justification?",

      {
        "label": "The current in the wire is counterclockwise because the magnetic flux is increasing with a magnetic field directed into the page.",
