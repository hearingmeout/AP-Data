The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nA group of students are given two small charged plastic disks that are on an air table, as shown. The disks are identical, have known mass <math alttext=\"m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>m</mi></math>, and have the same net charge. There is negligible friction between the disks and the table. The students are asked to use a straight-line graph to estimate the charge of one of the disks. The students have access to a meterstick and a motion sensor that can measure velocity and acceleration.\n\n(a) Design a procedure for collecting data that would allow the students to estimate the charge of one of the disks with a straight-line graph. Provide enough detail so that students could replicate the experiment, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty.",
