    "question": "Two identical conducting spheres are on insulating stands, as shown in the figure. The spheres have been given charges <math alttext=\"positive q sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> and <math alttext=\"negative q sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mpadded></math>, which have opposite signs and different magnitudes; i.e., <math alttext=\"positive q sub 1 is not equal to the absolute value of negative q sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mpadded><mo>≠</mo><mrow><mo>|</mo><mpadded><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mpadded><mo>|</mo></mrow></math>. The spheres are brought together to make contact and are then separated again. Which of the following correctly describes the electric force between the spheres before and after they make contact with each other?",
