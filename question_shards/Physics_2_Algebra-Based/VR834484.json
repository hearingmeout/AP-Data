    "question": "A negatively charged rod is brought close to, but does not touch, a neutral metal sphere, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. A wire is then connected between the sphere and ground as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. The wire is later removed, after which the rod is moved far away from the sphere. Which of the following figures best represents how the excess charge, if any, is distributed on the sphere’s surface after the wire and then the rod are both removed?",
