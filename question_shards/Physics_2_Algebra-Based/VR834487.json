    "description": "A solid conducting sphere with zero net charge is sitting on an insulating stand, also with zero net charge, as shown in the figure. An insulating rod with a positive charge is held near the sphere. A student makes the following incorrect claim:",
    "question": "“Since the sphere is a solid conductor and has zero net charge, it must be electrically neutral everywhere throughout its interior as well as everywhere on its surface.”Which of the following explains why the student’s claim is incorrect?",
