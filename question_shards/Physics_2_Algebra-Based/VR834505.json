    "question": "Four small, charged spheres are initially fixed in place at the corners of a square of side length <math alttext=\"s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>s</mi></math>, as shown in the figure labeled “Initial Configuration.” The charges on the spheres are as indicated. Then the top two spheres are each moved a distance <math alttext=\"s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>s</mi></math> to the right, as shown in the figure labeled “Final Configuration.” What happens to the electric potential energy <math alttext=\"U\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>U</mi></math> of the four-sphere system when the top two spheres are moved to the final configuration, and what evidence or reasoning supports the claim?",
