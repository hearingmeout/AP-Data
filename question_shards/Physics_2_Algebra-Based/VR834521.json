    "description": "A parallel plate capacitor consists of two plates separated by a distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math>. The capacitor is connected to a battery so that there is a potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></math> between the plates. The capacitor is then disconnected from the battery and isolated. While the capacitor is disconnected, the plates are moved together until they are a distance <math alttext=\"d over 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> apart. How do the magnitude of the electric field between the plates and the electric potential energy stored in the capacitor change, if at all, when the plates are moved closer together?",
