    "question": "An electron is moving with a horizontal velocity <math alttext=\"vector v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover><mi>v</mi><mo>→</mo></mover></math> toward two horizontal, parallel plates, as shown in the figure. The plates are made of a conducting material. The top plate has a positive charge, and the bottom plate has a negative charge of equal magnitude. Which of the following best represents the path of the electron when it is between the plates, and provides evidence or reasoning to support the claim? Assume that gravitational forces are negligible.\nElectron PathEvidence or ReasoningAThe electric field is directed toward the bottom of the figure.BThe electron is attracted to the negative plate and repelled by the positive plate.CThe net force on the electron is toward the top of the figure.DThe potential energy of the electron-plate system is higher when the electron is closer to the positive plate.",
