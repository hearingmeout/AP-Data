    "question": "The figure shows a close-up view of a portion of a long, thin, horizontal wire. If the current in the wire is zero, which of the following best represents the motion of individual charge carrier particles within the wire? The arrows represent instantaneous particle velocities, and a dot with no arrow indicates a particle at rest.",
