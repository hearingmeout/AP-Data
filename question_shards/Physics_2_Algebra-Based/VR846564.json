    "description": "Students have a collection of conductive cylinders, all made from the same material. The students measure the resistance and other properties of each cylinder. The students then group the cylinders into two sets, Set <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> and Set <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, based on their measurements.",
    "question": "Next, the students create the graph shown in the figure but do not label the horizontal axis. The graph shows resistance as a function of some physical quantity. A different physical quantity has a fixed value for all cylinders within the same set, and the fixed quantity is greater for the cylinders in one of the sets. The following table lists possible combinations of quantities and a proposed set for which the fixed quantity is greater. Which combination of quantities and claims is consistent with the graph?Quantity onhorizontal axisQuantity within a setthat is fixed in valueSet with greater valuefor the fixed quantityALengthCross-sectional areaSet <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> has cylinders with a greater cross-sectional area.BCross-sectional areaLengthSet <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> has cylinders with a greater length.CReciprocal of lengthCross-sectional areaSet <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> has cylinders with a greater cross-sectional area.DReciprocal of cross-sectional areaLengthSet <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> has cylinders with a greater length.",
