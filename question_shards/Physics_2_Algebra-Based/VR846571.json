    "description": "A motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The figure shows a setup in which a motor is used to spin a spool and pull a block horizontally across a table using a string wrapped around the spool. The spool has negligible mass and negligible friction in its axle, and the block can move with negligible friction on the tabletop.",
    "question": "Two groups of students have separate setups like the one shown in the figure. The two groups’ setups use identical blocks but have different motors. Both blocks are initially at rest when the motors are turned on.Student Group <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> applies a potential difference <math alttext=\"10 volts\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mi></math> to their motor, resulting in a motor current of <math alttext=\"0.40 amp\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.40</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math>. They turn their motor off <math alttext=\"2.0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2.0</mn></math> seconds after turning it on.Student Group <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> applies a potential difference <math alttext=\"20 volts\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>20</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mi></math> to their motor, resulting in a motor current of <math alttext=\"0.30 amp\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.30</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math>. They turn their motor off <math alttext=\"1.0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1.0</mn></math> second after turning it on.Assume that both motors convert <math alttext=\"100 percent\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>100</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of electrical energy into mechanical energy. Which group’s block is moving faster at the time the motor pulling it is turned off, and what evidence or reasoning supports the claim?",
