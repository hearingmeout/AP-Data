    "description": "A cylindrical tank is filled with water, and the walls of the tank are insulated so that no energy is transferred into or out of the tank by thermal processes. Inside the tank are two heating elements, Heater <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> and Heater <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math> with resistances <math alttext=\"R sub X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></msub></math> and <math alttext=\"R sub Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></msub></math>, respectively. <math alttext=\"R sub X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></msub></math> is greater than <math alttext=\"R sub Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></msub></math>. The heaters are connected by wires to the same source of <math alttext=\"e m f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>emf</mi></math>, and each is controlled by its own switch. (The switches and the source of <math alttext=\"e m f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>emf</mi></math> are not shown in the figure.)",
