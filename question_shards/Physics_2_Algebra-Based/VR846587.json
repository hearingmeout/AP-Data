    "question": "The figure shows a circuit comprised of a battery and six resistors with the indicated resistances. The labeled points indicate seven locations in the circuit, and the electric potential is defined to be zero at point <math alttext=\"O\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>O</mi></math>. Which of the following pairs of graphs best represents the electric potential <math alttext=\"V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>V</mi></math> as a function of position along the two circuit paths <math alttext=\"A B C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ABC</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"X Y Z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>XYZ</mi></math>? Assume that all graphs have the same scale for the potential.",
