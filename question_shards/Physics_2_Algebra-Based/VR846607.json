    "question": "A lightbulb, an uncharged capacitor, a battery, and an open switch are connected in a circuit, as shown in the figure. The switch is then closed. Which of the following correctly describes and provides a valid justification for the bulb’s behavior after the switch is closed?",

      {
        "label": "The bulb is lit immediately after the switch is closed and then gets dimmer. As charge carriers flow, they collect on the capacitor plates, so the current, initial at maximum, decreases as the potential difference on the capacitor increasingly opposes that of the battery.",

        "label": "The bulb is lit immediately after the switch is closed and then gets dimmer. The capacitor creates a flow of charge carriers that decreases until the capacitor is completely discharged, resulting in a gradual decrease in current in the circuit.",

      {
        "label": "The bulb is off immediately after the switch is closed and then gets brighter. Initially, the capacitor prevents the flow of charge carriers. Later, the eventual movement of charge carriers as the capacitor becomes charged results in a gradual increase in current in the circuit.",
