    "question": "A circuit consists of a lightbulb, a capacitor, a resistor, a battery, and two switches <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math>, as shown in the figure. Both switches are initially open. Switch <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math> is then closed and a long time passes while the capacitor becomes fully charged. Switch <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math> is then opened and Switch <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> is closed. Which of the following correctly describes and provides a valid justification for the bulb’s behavior over time after Switch <math alttext=\"X \" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> is closed?",
