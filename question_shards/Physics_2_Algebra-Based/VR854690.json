The object is free to be moved to any location along the principal axis in front of the mirror. Ray <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> and Ray <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> are two principal rays originating from the top of the object as shown, with Ray <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> parallel to the principal axis and Ray <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> directed toward the center of the mirror. (a) For the following claims, select the one that correctly describes images formed by the mirror._____ The image is real for any object location._____ The image is virtual for any object location._____ The image can be real or virtual, depending on the object location.Justify the claim you selected, referring to the behavior of the two principal rays shown in the figure. Do not manipulate equations in order to justify your selection.",
