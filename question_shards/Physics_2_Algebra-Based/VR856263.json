    "question": "An object is placed in front of a concave mirror at a location where the image formed by the mirror is at the same location as the object. The object is then moved a short distance closer to the mirror. What happens to the size of the image, and what evidence or reasoning helps support the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The image increases in size. When the object is moved a short distance closer to the mirror, the image moves farther from the mirror.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The image increases in size. When the object is moved a short distance closer to the mirror, the image moves even closer to the mirror than the object.",
