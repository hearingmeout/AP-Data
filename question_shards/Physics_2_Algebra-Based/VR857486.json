    "question": "An object is located in front of a spherical mirror. The image formed by the mirror is also located in front of the mirror and is larger in size than the object. Is the mirror concave or convex? What evidence supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Concave. The image is a virtual image.",
