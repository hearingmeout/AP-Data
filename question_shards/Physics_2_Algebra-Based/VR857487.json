    "question": "Which of the following correctly describes the images that can be formed by a concave mirror when an object is located on the mirror’s principal axis? Additionally, what reasoning in terms of the rays that originate from a common point on the object helps support the claim?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The images are always real. After being reflected from a concave mirror, rays that originate from a common point on the object always converge on the same side of the mirror as the object.",
