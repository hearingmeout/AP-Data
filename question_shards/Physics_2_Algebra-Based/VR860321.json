    "question": "The beam of monochromatic light is replaced with a beam of light that consists of two different wavelengths, one with wavelength <math alttext=\"three fourths lambda\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac><mi>λ</mi></math> and one with wavelength <math alttext=\"four thirds lambda\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mi>λ</mi></math>. Will the interference pattern on the screen be the same as the pattern with monochromatic light? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes , because the interference pattern does not depend on wavelength",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the average wavelength is still <math alttext=\"lambda\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>λ</mi></math>",

      {
        "label": "No, because there will be two superimposed interference patterns, each with different distances between maxima",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the light with different wavelengths will cancel each other and there will be no interference pattern",
