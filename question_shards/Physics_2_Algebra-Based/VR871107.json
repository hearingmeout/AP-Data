    "question": "A beam of photons and a beam of electrons are each sent through identical pairs of narrow, closely-spaced slits. The photons’ wavelength and the electrons’ wavelength are the same and comparable to the width of the slits. Which of the following correctly describes the patterns produced by the two beams on a screen located some distance beyond the slits?",

      {
