    "question": "A photon is moving toward the right with an initial frequency <math alttext=\"f sub i\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>. The photon then interacts with an electron that is initially moving to the left, toward the photon. After the interaction, the photon has a new frequency <math alttext=\"f sub f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></math> that is greater than <math alttext=\"f sub i\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>. Which of the following correctly describes the change, if any, in the speeds of the photon and the electron as a result of the interaction?",
