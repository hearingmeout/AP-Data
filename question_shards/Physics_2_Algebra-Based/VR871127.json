    "question": "A hypothetical atom with the energy levels shown in the diagram is in the ground state. Which of the following statements correctly describes whether a photon of wavelength <math alttext=\"95 nanometers\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>95</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>nm</mtext></math> can interact with the atom, and provides reasoning that supports the claim?",
