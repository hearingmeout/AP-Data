    "question": "The spectrum of radiation emitted by a blackbody can be represented with a graph of the radiated intensity per unit wavelength as a function of wavelength. Such a graph exhibits a peak wavelength at which the intensity per unit wavelength is a maximum. Two spherical blackbodies, Sphere <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>X</mtext></math> and Sphere <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Y</mtext></math>, are at the same temperature, while Sphere <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>X</mtext></math> has a greater mass and greater surface area than Sphere <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Y</mtext></math>. Which of the following claims correctly relates the peak wavelengths for the two spheres, and cites evidence or reasoning that supports the claim?",
