    "question": "Electromagnetic radiation is incident on the surface of a blackbody with a power per unit area that is the same as the radiation being emitted from the blackbody. What, if anything, is happening to the temperature of the blackbody under these conditions, and what reasoning supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The temperature is decreasing. The emission of radiation transfers energy out of the blackbody.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The temperature is decreasing. A longer peak wavelength is associated with a lower temperature.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The temperature is not changing. There is no net energy transfer into or out of the blackbody.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The temperature is not changing. All incident radiation gets absorbed by a blackbody.",

    "answer": "The temperature is not changing. There is no net energy transfer into or out of the blackbody."
