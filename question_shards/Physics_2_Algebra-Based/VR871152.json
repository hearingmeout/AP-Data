    "question": "Electromagnetic waves, in the form of x-rays with a specific wavelength, are observed to scatter off of a material. The scattered waves exhibit a wavelength shift that depends on the angle at which the waves are scattered. Which of the following provides evidence that the electromagnetic waves can be treated as a collection of discrete, quantized energy packets (i.e., photons)?",
