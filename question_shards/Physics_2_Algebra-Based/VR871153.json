    "question": "An x-ray photon travels toward an initially stationary electron and then scatters off of the electron with a different wavelength and in a different direction than it had initially. Is the wavelength of the scattered photon longer or shorter than the initial wavelength of the photon, and what is the reason for the change?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The scattered photon’s wavelength is longer because energy gets transferred from the photon to the electron.",
