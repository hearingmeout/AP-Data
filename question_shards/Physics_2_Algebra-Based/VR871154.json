    "question": "A photon travels toward an initially stationary electron and then scatters off the electron. After the scattering event, the photon travels in the opposite direction that it had initially. Which of the following correctly describes the energy transferred to the electron and provides evidence to support the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The energy transferred to the electron is a minimum compared to other photon scattering angles. The decrease in the photon’s wavelength is least when it’s direction changes by 180 degrees.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The energy transferred to the electron is a minimum compared to other photon scattering angles. The decrease in the photon’s frequency is least when it’s direction changes by 180 degrees.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The energy transferred to the electron is a maximum compared to other photon scattering angles. The increase in the photon’s wavelength is greatest when it’s direction changes by 180 degrees.",
