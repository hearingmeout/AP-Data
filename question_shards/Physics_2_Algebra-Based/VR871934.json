An upward pointing arrow is at a distance 2 f to the left of the lens and an incident ray is drawn from the top of that arrow horizontally to the right to the upper part of the lens. The ray is deflected upward and to the right by the lens. A dashed line is drawn from a distance f to the left of the lens to the upper part of the lens. The dashed line overlaps the ray on the right side of the lens.",
