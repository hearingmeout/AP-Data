    "description": "A student has three sunglass lenses. Lenses <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi> </math> have identical polarization patterns, as indicated by the lines in the figure. When unpolarized light passes through lenses <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math>, it becomes polarized, with the electric field oscillating in the direction of the lines. Lens <math alttext=\"C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">C</mi></math> is not polarizing.",
