    "description": "A student is doing an experiment in which monochromatic light passes through a double slit, creating a pattern of dark and bright lines on a nearby screen. The student has a red light and a green light. The student also has two sets of slits, one with a smaller separation between the slits and one with a larger separation.",
    "question": "Which of the following combinations of light color and slit separation will create the pattern with the greatest separation between the bright lines?\n\nColor\n Slit Separation\n\nA\n Green\n Large\n\nB\n Green\n Small\n\nC\n Red\n Large\n\nD\n Red\n Small",
