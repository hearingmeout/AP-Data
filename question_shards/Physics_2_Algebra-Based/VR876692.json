    "description": "Two different uniform strings are attached to each other, as shown in the figure. The strings are made of the same material, and the string on the left has a smaller diameter than the string on the right. A wave pulse in the left string has an upward displacement and is traveling to the right, as indicated, toward the attachment point between the two strings. Which of the following correctly identifies the displacement direction for the wave pulse reflected back to the left at the point of attachment, and also correctly identifies whether a wave pulse is transmitted along the thick string on the right?",
