    "question": "A satellite dish is a receiver for radio waves emitted by a satellite in orbit around Earth. Which of the following correctly states whether the radio waves received by a satellite dish could be polarized, and provides evidence or reasoning that supports the statement?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The radio waves could be polarized. The electric field of a radio wave is directed perpendicular to the wave’s direction of travel.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The radio waves could be polarized. The waves travel through the air before being detected, and air can only transmit transverse waves.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The radio waves cannot be polarized. The electric field of a radio wave is directed along the wave’s direction of travel.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The radio waves cannot be polarized. The waves travel through the air before being detected, and air can only transmit longitudinal waves.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The radio waves could be polarized. The electric field of a radio wave is directed perpendicular to the wave’s direction of travel."
