    "question": "A toy consists of two metal cans connected by a long, thin, string that is stretched taut. When one person speaks into one can, the sound waves in the air cause the can to vibrate. The vibrations of the can then cause a wave that travels along the string. When the wave reaches the other end of the string, it causes the other can to vibrate, which creates a sound wave in the air that a second person can hear.\nThe toy is stretched between two students, Student <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> and Student <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math>. In case <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, Student <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> speaks into one can at a normal speaking volume. In case <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, the students add additional tension to the string and Student <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> speaks into the can with a significantly quieter voice. Which of the following best indicates how the speeds of the waves on the string compare in the two cases and provides a valid justification?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The speeds of the waves are the same in each case. The speed at which a wave propagates through a string is independent of the tension of the string.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The speeds of the waves are the same in each case. The speed at which a wave propagates through a string is a property of the string and does not change.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The speeds of the waves are different in the two cases. The speed at which a wave propagates through a string depends on the tension in the string.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The speeds of the waves are different in the two cases. The speed at which a wave propagates through a string depends on the energy carried by the wave.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The speeds of the waves are different in the two cases. The speed at which a wave propagates through a string depends on the tension in the string."
