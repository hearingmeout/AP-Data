    "description": "The figure shows one of three setups that are each used to generate a wave pulse on a taut string. In each setup, one end of the string is connected to a pulse generator and the other end of the string passes over a pulley and has a block hanging from it. The pulse generator creates a wave pulse that travels along the horizontal length of the string.",
    "question": "When the wave pulse in Setup <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> reaches the pulley, it reverses direction and travels back along the string toward the pulse generator. If some of the energy in the wave pulse is transferred to the surroundings during the short time it is reversing direction, how would the pulse change when it reverses direction?",
