    "question": "When the wave pulse in Setup <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math> reaches the pulley, it reverses direction and travels back along the string toward the pulse generator. If some of the energy in the wave pulse is transferred to the surroundings during the short time it is reversing direction, how would the pulse change when it reverses direction?",
