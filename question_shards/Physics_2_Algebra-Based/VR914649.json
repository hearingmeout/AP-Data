    "question": "The figure shows one end of a string connected to a pulse generator and the other end of the string passing over a pulley with a block hanging from it. The pulse generator can create wave pulses that travel along the horizontal length of the string. Which of the following changes to the configuration would cause an increase in the speed at which pulses propagate along the string?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Hang a block of less mass from the string.",
