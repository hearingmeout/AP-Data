    "question": "Two students are experimenting with wave pulses on a string, as shown in the figure. The student on the left holds one end of the string. The other end of the string passes over a pulley, held by the student on the right, and is attached to a cylinder that hangs vertically. In two experimental trials, a wave pulse is created and travels to the right along the string. In the first experimental trial, the students use nearly the full length of the string. In the second trial, they use approximately half the length of the string. The amplitude of the wave pulse is the same in both trials.\nWhich of the following correctly compares the propagation speed of the pulse in the two trials, and provides evidence or reasoning that helps support the claimed comparison?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The pulse speed is faster in the first trial. The pulse travels along a greater length of string in the first trial.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pulse speed is faster in the first trial. The pulse travels along a more massive section of string in the first trial.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pulse speed is the same in both trials. The pulse’s amplitude is the same in the two trials.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The pulse speed is the same in both trials. The string’s tension and mass per length are the same in the two trials.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The pulse speed is the same in both trials. The string’s tension and mass per length are the same in the two trials."
