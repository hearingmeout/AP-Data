    "question": "Four different periodic waves are produced on the same string, but at different times. Each of the following graphs represents, for one of the waves, the displacement <math alttext=\"delta y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>y</mi></math> as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> at the same location on the string. The graphs all use the same scale for both the displacement and the time. Which graph represents the wave that has the greatest period?",

The curve then moves upward and to the right, crosses the horizontal axis at 4 units, and reaches a second peak at the point with coordinates 5 units comma 0.5 unit. It then moves downward and to the right until it ends on the horizontal axis at 6 units. Note that all coordinates are approximate.",
