    "question": "Two sound waves are traveling through the air. The waves are both periodic but have different frequencies. Is it possible for the two sound waves to have the same loudness? What evidence or reasoning helps support the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes. The frequency and wavelength of a wave are inversely proportional to each other.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes. The amplitude and the frequency of a wave are independent of each other.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No. Higher frequency sound waves are always louder than lower frequency sound waves.",

        "label": "No. The amplitude and frequency of a wave are inversely related.",
