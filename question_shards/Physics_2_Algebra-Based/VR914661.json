    "question": "When tuning a stringed instrument, a musician can produce a different pitch by changing the tension in the string. The wavelength of the wave on the string does not change as a result of increasing the tension in the string. Which of the following correctly describes the change in the frequency of the wave that would be observed if the tension in the string is increased, and also provides evidence that helps support the claim?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The frequency increases. The speed of the wave on the string increases.",
