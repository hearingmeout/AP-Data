    "question": "Two different uniform strings are attached to each other, as shown in the figure. The strings are made of the same material, and the string on the left has a thicker diameter than the string on the right. A wave pulse in the left string has an upward displacement and is traveling to the right, as indicated, toward the attachment point between the two strings. After the pulse reaches the point of attachment between the strings, there is both a reflected pulse in the thick string and a transmitted pulse in the thin string. Which of the following correctly identifies both the displacement direction for the reflected pulse as well as the pulse that has a faster wave speed?\nReflected Wave Pulse DisplacementPulse with Faster Wave SpeedARemains upwardTransmitted pulseBRemains upwardReflected pulseCInverts to be downwardTransmitted pulseDInverts to be downwardReflected pulse",
