    "question": "An electromagnetic wave pulse, represented in the figure, consists of a pulse-shaped pattern of electric fields <math alttext=\"vector E\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover><mi>E</mi><mo>→</mo></mover></math> that travels through space, with a speed equal to the speed of light in that medium. The pulse initially travels in a vacuum and is incident on a piece of glass with an index of refraction of <math alttext=\"1.50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1.50</mn></math>. The pulse is then both reflected off the glass surface and transmitted into the glass. Which of the following correctly describes the energy carried by the transmitted pulse and the orientation of the reflected pulse?\nEnergy of Transmitted PulseOrientation of Reflected PulseAEqual to that of the incident pulse.The same as the incident pulse.BEqual to that of the incident pulse.Inverted relative to the incident pulse.CLess than that of the incident pulse.The same as the incident pulse.DLess than that of the incident pulse.Inverted relative to the incident pulse.",
