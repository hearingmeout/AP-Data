    "question": "Two polarizers are oriented at <math alttext=\"90\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>90</mn></math> degrees relative to one another, as shown in the figure. A beam of unpolarized light is incident on the first polarizer. Is any of the light transmitted through the second polarizer? What evidence or reasoning supports the claim? Assume that intensity losses at the polarizers, if any, are due only to polarization effects.",
