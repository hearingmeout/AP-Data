    "question": "A satellite is in orbit around Earth. The figure shows the satellite at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, and the satellite takes a time <math alttext=\"Uppercase T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>T</mi></math> to complete one orbit. Also shown is a distant space probe that emits radio waves that are later received by the satellite. Which of the following graphs best represents the frequency of the radio waves observed by the satellite?\nAssume that the distant space probe can be considered to be at rest and that Earth does not move appreciably during the time <math alttext=\"0, is less than or equal to, t, which is less than or equal to, uppercase T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>T</mi></math>.",
