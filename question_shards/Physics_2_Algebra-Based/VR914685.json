    "question": "An ambulance initially moves with a constant acceleration toward a student. The ambulance produces a constant sound wave with a rest frequency <math alttext=\"f sub R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>R</mi></msub></math>. The ambulance passes the student and continues moving in the same direction away from the student with the same constant acceleration. Which of the following graphs best represents the frequency <math alttext=\"f sub observed\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mtext>obs</mtext></msub></math> observed by the student as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math>?",

The vertical axis is labeled “f sub obs, of t,” and the value f sub R is indicated about two thirds of the way up the axis. A horizontal grid line extends to the right from f sub R. The graph consists of 3 line segments. The first line segment begins on the vertical axis, above f sub R, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends about halfway along the horizontal axis. The second line segment begins where the first segment ends, and moves vertically downward until it ends slightly below f sub R. The third line segment begins where the second segment ends, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends near the end of the horizontal axis.",
