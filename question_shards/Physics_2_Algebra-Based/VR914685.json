    "question": "An ambulance initially moves with a constant acceleration toward a student. The ambulance produces a constant sound wave with a rest frequency <math alttext=\"f sub R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>R</mi></msub></math>. The ambulance passes the student and continues moving in the same direction away from the student with the same constant acceleration. Which of the following graphs best represents the frequency <math alttext=\"f sub observed\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mtext>obs</mtext></msub></math> observed by the student as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math>?",
