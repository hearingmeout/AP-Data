    "question": "A soap bubble consists of a thin film of a soap-water solution with air on either side. The figure shows part of the soap bubble, where a wave of visible light is incident on the top interface between air and the film of soapy water. The wave gets reflected at both the top interface and the bottom interface. For which interface, if either, is there a <math alttext=\"180 degrees\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>180</mn><mo>°</mo></math> phase change when the wave reflects?",
