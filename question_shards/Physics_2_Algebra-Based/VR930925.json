The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nIn Experiment <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, students are asked to use a graph to determine the charge of an electron. Two metal plates are connected to a power supply of variable, known emf <math alttext=\"script uppercase E\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>Ɛ</mi></math>. The plates are inside and on opposite sides of a vacuum-filled chamber. Electromagnetic radiation is incident to one plate. This results in the ejection of electrons from the plate. Ejected electrons move toward the other plate, as shown. The students also have access to an ammeter and a device that emits electromagnetic radiation of variable, known wavelength <math alttext=\"lambda\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>λ</mi></math>. The device emits only one wavelength of electromagnetic radiation at a time.\n\n(a) Describe a procedure for collecting data that would allow the students to use a graph to determine the charge of an electron. Include any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty.",
