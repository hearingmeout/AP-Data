The population curve starts at zero in 1820, increases slowly then increases rapidly to two point two five million by 1850.

A)The dotted line overlaps the solid line until 1850, except that it reaches up to three million sheep, and then follows a similar pattern of fluctuation at a higher population level, between two and three million.",
