    "description": "An antigen can induce an immune response in a host organism. Antigens are targeted by antibodies that are produced by the organism’s immune system in response to contact with the antigen. Antibodies are specific to antigens. Many different cell types are involved in immune responses.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the role of cell-to-cell communication during a response to an invasion of antigens?",
