    "description": "Mollusks are a group of invertebrates that include animals such as clams, snails, and octopuses. Although their external phenotypes vary, all mollusks have three shared derived characters: the mantle, the muscular foot, and the radula.\n\nA possible evolutionary relationship among four groups of mollusks—Caudofoveata, Solenogastres, Polyplacophora, and Conchifera—is shown in the cladogram in the figure. The cladogram also shows the relationship with Annelida as a group of invertebrates that has a lineage and is an out-group. Horizontal lines indicate the evolution of certain characters.\n\nA Cladogram Representing a Possible Evolutionary Relationship Among Four Groups of Mollusks and One Group of Invertebrates",
