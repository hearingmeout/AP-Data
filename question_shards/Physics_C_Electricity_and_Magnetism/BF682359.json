    "question": "Evolution of a new trait typically takes many generations. Yet a dramatic shift in the extent of armor plating in the Lake Washington stickleback population occurred in the 50 years following the cleanup of the lake. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of the rapid evolution of the armor phenotype in the Lake Washington sticklebacks?",
