    "description": "A culture of white-eyed fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) was maintained for many generations. Females from the stock white-eyed culture were crossed with red-eyed (wild-type) males. The F1 females were crossed with the white-eyed males from the original culture. The resulting phenotypes of the progeny are summarized below.",
    "question": "Parental Generation Cross F1 Generation (at least 500 flies) White-eyed females × red-eyed males 100% of females are red-eyed 100% of males are white-eyed F1 Generation Cross F2 Generation (at least 500 flies) F1 red-eyed females × white-eyed males 50% of females are red-eyed and 50% are white-eyed 50% of males are red-eyed and 50% are white-eyed Which of the following best describes the mode of inheritance of eye color in the white culture?",
