    "description": "A small lake, located downstream of a power plant, recently experienced a die-off of multiple aquatic species. Environmentalists had been monitoring the temperature of the lake for several months prior to the die-off and noticed a significant spike in the temperature of the lake immediately preceding the die-off event.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains why the die-off event occurred in the lake following the increased water temperature?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The warm water increased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, which led to an increase in the photosynthetic rate of the aquatic organisms.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warm water increased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, which led to an increase in the amount of competition by consumers for food.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warm water decreased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, which led to an increase in the rate of decomposition in the lake.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warm water decreased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, which led to an increase in the respiration rate of the aquatic organisms.",

    ],
    "answer": "The warm water decreased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, which led to an increase in the respiration rate of the aquatic organisms."
