    "question": "​A saltwater fish has specialized cells that contain  \\(Na^+/K^+\\)ATPase to help with osmoregulation. Scientists studying this fish investigated the effect of the different concentrations of salt in the saltwater on the activity of  \\(Na^+/K^+\\)ATPase between six and 96 hours (Figure 1).​\n\n​Figure 1. Activity of \\(Na^+/K^+\\)ATPase at different saltwater concentrations over time. Error bars represent \\(\\pm SE_{\\overline{x}}\\)​\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately supports the data shown in Figure 1?",
