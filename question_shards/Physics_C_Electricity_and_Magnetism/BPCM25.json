    "question": "A team of scientists grew small pieces of coral in controlled tanks. Once these pieces of coral reached sufficient size, they were transferred to natural reefs to replace lost corals in the ocean. A scientist from the team suggested revising the experiment so that the water temperature in all the tanks would be increased to \\(0.5\\degree C\\) above the normal ocean temperature. The corals pieces that survived the increased temperature in the tank would be separated and allowed to grow into different colonies. When these new colonies grown from those coral pieces grown in warmer water reached sufficient size, they would be transferred to natural reefs.\n\nWhich of the following statements predicts the most likely outcome of the revised experiment?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The increased temperature will induce corals to create new genes, which will allow the corals to withstand future increases in ocean temperature.",

        "label": "Stress from the increased temperature will cause corals to evolve into a new species that can tolerate future increases in ocean temperature.",

      {
        "label": "After being transferred to the natural reef, the new colonies of corals will return to their previous heat tolerance level and will not survive future increases in ocean temperature.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The new colonies of corals are artificially selected for tolerating an increased temperature, so they will be better adapted to moderate future increases in ocean temperature.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The new colonies of corals are artificially selected for tolerating an increased temperature, so they will be better adapted to moderate future increases in ocean temperature."
