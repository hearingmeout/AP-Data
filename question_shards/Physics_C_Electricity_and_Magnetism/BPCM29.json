    "description": "Scientists studying the evolution of bears analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among several extant bear species using 27 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes. In addition to the five extant bear species, three genomes from an extinct species of cave bear were examined. The scientists constructed the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1).",
    "question": "Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree of bears based on 27 mtDNA genomes. Each square represents one mtDNA genome. The asterisk symbol (*) denotes brown bears from Admiralty, Baranof, and Chichagof Islands. Which of the following statements best explains the characteristics of two species that are on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1?",
