    "description": "Scientists studying small mammals called voles investigated how the growth rate of the female vole population changed during different seasons. Once a month, researchers captured voles, counted the females, and then released the voles back into their habitat. The data were used to estimate the total female population size and calculate the growth rate of the female population through each of the seasons (Figure 1).",
    "question": "Figure 1. Growth rate of female vole population across four seasons. The error bars represent \\(\\pm SE_{\\overline{x}}\\) Which of the following statements about the growth rate of the female vole population is best supported by the data in Figure 1?",
