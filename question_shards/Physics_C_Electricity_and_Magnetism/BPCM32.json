    "question": "Researchers studying parasitic hookworms investigated the effect of the size of the female hookworm population on the number of eggs produced per worm (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Eggs produced per hookworm in female populations of various sizes\n\nBased on the data in Figure 1, which of the following statements best explains the relationship between numbers of females and eggs produced per day per female?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "As the female population increases, each individual expends more energy on competition, leaving less energy available for egg production.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Females in larger populations reduce their energy output for egg-laying to conserve resources for maintaining the overall population size.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The decrease in eggs produced per female reflects a shift in energy allocation from reproduction to improved egg quality in denser populations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "As the number of females grows, the total energy output of the population for egg production remains stable, resulting in fewer eggs produced per female.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "As the female population increases, each individual expends more energy on competition, leaving less energy available for egg production."
