    "question": "A researcher is studying three transport proteins (A, B, and C) in the membrane and has observed that protein A exhibits passive transport. Figure 1 shows the movement of solute particles in the different transport proteins. In the figure, two different conformations of the same protein are shown for protein B and protein C.\n\nFigure 1. Transport proteins A, B, and C in the membrane\n\nBased on Figure 1, which of the following experiments would best confirm that protein A utilizes passive transport, while proteins B and C do not?",
