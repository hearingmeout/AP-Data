    "question": "Bt crops have been genetically modified to express a gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Bt crops produce a protein that is harmful to insects that consume it but is harmless to humans and other mammals. Scientists have observed that some insects appear to be resistant to the protein produced by Bt crops. They collected data to compare the amount of Bt crops being grown with the number of cases of resistance to the Bt crop protein in insects (Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Comparison of the Amount of Bt Crops Grown with the Number of Cases of Insect Resistance to Bt Crops\n\nYear\n Amount of Bt Crops Grown\n\n(million hectares*)\n Total Number of Cases of Insect Resistance\n\nto Bt Crops\n\n1996\n 0\n 0\n\n2000\n 11\n 0\n\n2004\n 22\n 2\n\n2008\n 46\n 6\n\n2012\n 70\n 11\n\n2016\n 98\n 16\n\n*1 hectare = \\(10,000\\ m^2\\)\n\nBased on the data in Table 1, which of the following best describes how the amount of Bt crops grown is related to incidence of insect resistance to Bt crops?",
