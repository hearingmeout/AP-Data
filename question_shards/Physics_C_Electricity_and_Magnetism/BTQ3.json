    "question": "Researchers analyzed the composition of cell membranes of bacteria living in different environments. Thermophiles are bacteria that live at extremely high temperatures, typically at or above \\(\\text{70}{}^\\circ \\text{C}\\). \n\nWhich of the following best predicts the effect of a greater proportion of saturated fatty acids, as compared with unsaturated fatty acids, on the stability of the cell membrane in thermophiles?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "A greater proportion of saturated fatty acids has no effect on cell membrane stability because both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are hydrophobic.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A greater proportion of saturated fatty acids leads to increased membrane stability at lower temperatures because saturated fatty acids increase the stability of the membrane.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A greater proportion of saturated fatty acids leads to decreased membrane stability because saturated fatty acids decrease the fluidity of the membrane.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A greater proportion of saturated fatty acids leads to increased membrane stability at higher temperatures because saturated fatty acids pack tightly together.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "A greater proportion of saturated fatty acids leads to increased membrane stability at higher temperatures because saturated fatty acids pack tightly together."
