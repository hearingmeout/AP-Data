    "question": "A researcher is studying a specific type of cellular defect in animal cells. She notices that cells with this defect have reduced energy storage and decreased cell membrane stability. \n\nWhich of the following predicts the type of cellular defect that is the most likely cause of the researcher’s observation?",
