    "question": "Read the following article from the Fremont Daily Times and answer the questions that follow. Fremont Daily TimesMay 1, 2018GREEN IS THE NEW COLOR AT FREMONT HIGH SCHOOL!A group of students from Fremont High School addressed the city council last night and proposed that one of the existing buildings at Fremont High School, which was built in 1970, be renovated to take advantage of recent advances in green technology. Currently the heat for the school is provided by fossil fuel combustion. The students said that the redesigned building would reduce the school’s carbon footprint, which is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds released by various human activities. Incorporating specific features that conserve energy and utilize renewable energy sources can help reduce the carbon footprint. Councilperson Gail Fassler praised the idea, saying that the project could conserve local water resources, and act as a “shining beacon” of sustainability for the greater Fremont community. Fassler suggested the project could even incorporate a living green roof as an additional sustainable feature. The council approved the initial site planning request and urged students to report back when the project was under way.The students want to reduce the school’s carbon footprint. Define carbon footprint. Identify one way the school’s heating system is likely adding to the school’s carbon footprint. Describe one realistic way to reduce the contribution of the heating system to the school’s carbon footprint. Identify TWO environmental benefits of a living green roof, such as that suggested by Councilperson Fassler. Describe TWO practices the cafeteria’s food service could use to decrease the environmental impacts of Fremont High School.Discuss TWO benefits of using native plants for landscaping at Fremont High School. During the renovation, the carpeting must be replaced. Discuss one environmental benefit of using flooring made of plant material, such as cork or bamboo, instead of carpet made of synthetic fibers.",
