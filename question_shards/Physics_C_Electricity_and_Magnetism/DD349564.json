    "description": "Researchers were studying species diversity in a savanna rangeland community in southwest Queensland, Australia. Researchers counted the numbers of plants species in four different categories at two nearby sites within the savanna rangeland; one lightly grazed by herbivores and one heavily grazed by herbivores (Figure 1).",
    "question": "Figure 1. Plant species richness in lightly and heavily grazed savanna communities. Which of the following best predicts the results of a drought in the savanna research area with regards to community resilience to this environmental change?",
