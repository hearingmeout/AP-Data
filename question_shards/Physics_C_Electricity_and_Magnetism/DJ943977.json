    "description": "Both liver cells and lens cells have the genes for making the proteins albumin and crystalline. However, only liver cells express the blood protein albumin and only lens cells express crystalline, the main protein in the lens of the eye. Both of these genes have enhancer sequences associated with them.",
    "question": "The claim that gene regulation results in differential gene expression and influences cellular products (albumin or crystalline) is best supported by evidence in which of the following statements?",
