    "description": "Certain bacteria can use both ethyl alcohol and acetate as sources of nutrients. In an experiment where both nutrients are available to a bacterial population, the following results were obtained and graphed.",
    "question": "What additional procedure would best help determine whether these movements are due to active transport or to passive transport?",
