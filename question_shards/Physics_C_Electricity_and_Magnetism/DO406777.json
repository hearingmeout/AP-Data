    "description": "In a population of coyotes, there is variation in the size of individual animals. Larger animals are able to bring down larger prey but also require more food to survive. In a particular area, the primary food source for many years had been rabbits, but disease led to a sudden crash in the rabbit population. However, the deer population in the area increased at about the same time. Over time, naturalists noted that the average size of coyotes in the population had increased.",
    "question": "Which of the following is the best explanation for the increase in average coyote size following the crash in the rabbit population?",

      {
        "label": "Deer run faster than rabbits, so coyotes needed to get larger to survive.",

      {
        "label": "Since the coyotes needed to be larger to bring down the deer, they grew larger.",

        "label": "Since smaller coyotes struggled to obtain enough food, they produced larger offspring to improve their fitness.",
