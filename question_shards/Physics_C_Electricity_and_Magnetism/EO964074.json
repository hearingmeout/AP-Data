    "description": "Blood clots are formed by a positive feedback loop. Two pathways exist, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, which converge during clot formation. There are many clotting factors involved, most of which are proteins. Vitamin <math alttext=\"K\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is required for the formation of the active form of several of the clotting factors, including Factor <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>X</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. A simplified model of the blood clotting process is shown in Figure 1.",
