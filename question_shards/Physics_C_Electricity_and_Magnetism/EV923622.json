    "description": "Platelets are fragments of larger cells and normally circulate in the blood without adhering to blood vessel walls. When the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, collagen fibers in the wall are exposed to the interior of the blood vessel. The exposed fibers and chemicals released from the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel attract platelets, which start to form a plug and release other chemicals (Figure 1).",
    "question": "Figure 1. Formation of a platelet plug in a damaged blood vessel wall Which of the following best explains the feedback mechanism illustrated in Figure 1 ?",
