    "description": "An African violet grower observes that genetically identical African violet plants growing near the walls of the greenhouse have white flowers, that plants growing farther away from the walls have pale blue flowers, and that plants growing nearest the center of the greenhouse have dark blue flowers.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the differences in flower color of the African violets in the greenhouse?",

      {

      {
        "label": "More light is available along the walls of the greenhouse, so the flowers need less pigment to absorb sunlight for photosynthesis.",
