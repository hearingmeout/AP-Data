    "description": "Catalase is an enzyme found in yeast cells that facilitates the chemical breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen gas. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of <math alttext=\"p H\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> on catalase function. Five buffer solutions of varying <math alttext=\"p H\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) were prepared and added to separate test tubes.

Yeast was added, and the reactions were timed. After 1 minute the amount of oxygen gas released was determined by measuring the foam layer produced in each test tube. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental setup.",
