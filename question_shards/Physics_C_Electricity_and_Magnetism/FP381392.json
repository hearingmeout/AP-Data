Effect of Exposing Identical Caterpillars to Specific Colors of Light Phenotype of Adult Butterfly Caterpillars Exposed to Red Light Caterpillars Exposed to Blue Light Wing color Darker Lighter Body size Smaller Larger Which of the following best explains the cause of the phenotypic variation observed in the butterflies?",
