    "question": "Beaked whales feed at various depths, but they\n defecate at the ocean’s surface. Nitrogen-rich\n whale feces deposited in surface waters supply\n nutrients for algae that are eaten by surface dwelling\n fish. Which of the following best\n predicts what would happen if the whale\n population decreased?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There would be a reduction in surface\n nitrogen concentration, which would cause\n an algal bloom.",
