    "description": "Rhagoletis pomonella is a parasitic fly native to North America that infests fruit trees. The female fly lays her\n eggs in the fruit. The larvae hatch and burrow through the developing fruit. The next year, the adult flies emerge.\n\nPrior to the European colonization of North America, the major host of Rhagoletis was a native species of\n hawthorn, Crataegus marshallii. The domestic apple tree, Malus domestica, is not native to North America, but was\n imported by European settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s.\n\nWhen apple trees were first imported into North America, there was no evidence that Rhagoletis could use them\n as hosts. Apples set fruit earlier in the season and develop faster, where hawthorns set later and develop more\n slowly.\n\nRecent analysis of Rhagoletis populations has shown that two distinct populations of flies have evolved from the\n original ancestral population of flies that were parasitic on hawthorns. One population infests only apple trees, and\n the other infests only hawthorns. The life cycles of both fly populations are coordinated with those of their host trees.\n The flies of each population apparently can distinguish and select mates with similar host preferences and reject\n mates from the population specific to the other host tree. There is very little hybridization (only about 5 percent)\n between the two groups.",
