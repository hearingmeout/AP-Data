    "question": "Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is a recessive\n genetic disorder that includes the characteristics\n of short stature and extra fingers or toes. In the\n general population, this syndrome occurs in\n approximately 1 in 150,000 live births. In a\n particular isolated population, however, the\n incidence of this syndrome among live births\n is 1 in 500.\n\nAssume that both the isolated population and\n the general population are in Hardy-Weinberg\n equilibrium with respect to this syndrome. Which\n of the following best describes the difference\n between the frequency of the allele that causes\n the syndrome in the general population and the\n frequency of the allele in the isolated population?",

      {
        "label": "The frequency of the Ellis-van Creveld allele\n is 0.002 in the isolated population and\n 0.0000066 in the general population,\n which suggests that selection for this trait\n is occurring in both populations.",

      {
        "label": "The frequency of the Ellis-van Creveld allele\n is 0.0447 in the isolated population and\n 0.0026 in the general population, showing\n that the rate of genetic mutation is highest\n among individuals in the isolated\n population.",
