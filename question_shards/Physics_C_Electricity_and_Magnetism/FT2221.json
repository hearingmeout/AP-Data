A steroid hormone is shown outside of the cell, and there is an arrow from the steroid hormone to a receptor molecule located inside the cell. The combination of the steroid hormone and the receptor molecule is shown in the cell both inside and outside of the nucleus and is labeled hormone-receptor complex. Inside the nucleus is a strand of D N A labeled transcription. Outside the nucleus a strand of R N A touching the nucleus is labeled translation.",
