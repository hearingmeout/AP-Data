    "question": "Lactose digestion in E. coli begins with its hydrolysis by the enzyme β-galactosidase. The gene encoding β-galactosidase, lacZ, is part of a coordinately regulated operon containing other genes required for lactose utilization.\n\nWhich of the following figures correctly depicts the interactions at the lac operon when lactose is NOT being utilized? (The legend below defines the shapes of the molecules illustrated in the options.)",

The operator is lactose fitted onto the repressor protein. On the right of operator, three structural genes are represented in intervals, labeled as lac Z, lac Y, and lac A.",
