    "question": "MRSA is the acronym for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Many of the strains of the common bacterium are also resistant to other antibiotics in use today. The resistance is linked to a collection of genes carried on plasmids that are passed from one bacterium to another by conjugation. Suppose a newly discovered, chemically different antibiotic is used in place of methicillin. Which of the following would be the most likely effect on Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic resistance?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The gene for methicillin resistance, no longer needed, would disappear entirely from Staphylococcus aureus populations within a few generations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Transmission of the methicillin-resistance plasmid by conjugation would increase among the Staphylococcus aureus population as the genes would confer resistance to the new antibiotic.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Transmission of the methicillin-resistance plasmid would gradually decrease but the plasmid would not entirely disappear from the Staphylococcus aureus population.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Transmission of the methicillin-resistance plasmid by conjugation would increase among the Staphylococcus aureus population due to destruction of bacteria without the plasmid through use of the new antibiotic.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Transmission of the methicillin-resistance plasmid would gradually decrease but the plasmid would not entirely disappear from the Staphylococcus aureus population."
