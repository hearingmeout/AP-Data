    "question": "To determine the evolutionary history and relationships among organisms, scientists gather evidence from a wide variety of sources including paleontology, embryology, morphology, behavior, and molecular biology. A phylogenetic tree of vertebrates is shown. Which of the following statements is most consistent with the phylogenetic tree shown?",
