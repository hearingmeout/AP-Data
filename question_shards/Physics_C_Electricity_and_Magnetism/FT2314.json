    "question": "Figure I shows the growth of an algal species in a flask of sterilized pond water. If phosphate is added as indicated, the growth curve changes as shown in Figure II.\n\nWhich of the following is the best prediction of the algal growth if nitrate is added instead of phosphate?",

The growth curve starts at the intersection of the x and y axes and increases exponentially then flattens out halfway up the the vertical axis. Nitrate is added after the growth curve flattens out, then the curve increases exponentially again and flattens out at the top of the vertical axis.",
