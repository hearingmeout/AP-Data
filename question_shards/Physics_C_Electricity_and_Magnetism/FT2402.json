    "question": "Lactose digestion in E. coli begins with its hydrolysis by the enzyme β-galactosidase. The gene encoding β-galactosidase, lacZ, is part of a coordinately regulated operon containing other genes required for lactose utilization.\nWhich of the following figures correctly depicts the interactions at the lac operon when lactose is NOT being utilized? (The legend below defines the shapes of the molecules illustrated in the options.)",

RNA polymerase is attached to the DNA at the promoter region, moving towards the operator. Lactose is attached to the repressor protein and is above the operator region not attached to the operon.",
