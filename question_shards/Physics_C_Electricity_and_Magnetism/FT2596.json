    "description": "A respirometer is a container used to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by an organism. A respirometer was used to determine how environmental temperature affects the uptake of oxygen in one 300-gram rat and one 50-gram mouse. The results of this experiment are shown on the graph below.",
