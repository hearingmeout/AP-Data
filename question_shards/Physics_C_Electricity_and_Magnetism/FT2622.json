    "description": "Directions: Each group of questions below concerns an experimental or laboratory situation or data. In each case, first study the description of the situation or data. Then choose the one best answer to each question following it and fill in the corresponding circle on the answer sheet.\n\nDialysis tubing is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose. Four dialysis tubes are half filled with 5 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent, and 40 percent sucrose solutions, respectively, and two dialysis tubes are half filled with distilled water. The dialysis tubes are all sealed at both ends, and the initial masses are determined. Five dialysis tubes are placed into beakers containing distilled water, and the sixth dialysis tube, containing distilled water, is placed into a 40 percent sucrose solution. The masses of the dialysis tubes are recorded at 30-minute intervals for 90 minutes, as shown in the table below.",
    "question": "The contents of which dialysis tube are initially isotonic to the distilled water in the beaker?",
