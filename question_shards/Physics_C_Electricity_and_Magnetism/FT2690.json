    "description": "Directions: Each group of questions below concerns an experimental or laboratory situation or data. In each case, first study the description of the situation or data. Then choose the one best answer to each question following it.\n\nThe following questions refer to the following information and graph.\n\nThe data presented in the figure below are measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption at differing body masses in a species of fish. Each point represents measurements from a different fish. Measurements were taken at different temperatures. (○= 10°C,●= 15°C, □= 20°C, ■= 25°C.)",
