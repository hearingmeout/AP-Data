    "description": "An experiment to measure the rate of respiration in crickets and mice at 10o C and 25o C was performed using a respirometer, an apparatus that measures changes in gas volume. Respiration was measured in mL of O2 consumed per gram of organism over several five-minute trials, and the following data were obtained.",
    "question": "According to the data, the mice at 10o C demonstrated greater oxygen consumption per gram of tissue than did the mice at 25o C. This is most likely explained by which of the following statements?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The mice at 10o C had a higher rate of ATP production than the mice at 25o C.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mice at 10o C had a lower metabolic rate than the mice at 25o C.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mice at 25o C weighed less than the mice at 10o C.",

      {
        "label": "The mice at 25o C were more active than the mice at 10o C.",
