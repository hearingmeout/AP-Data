    "description": "Directions: Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case and then fill in the corresponding circle on the answer sheet. \n\nThe food web above represents feeding relationships in a biological community near a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Hydrothermal vents are geysers on the seafloor that gush super-heated, mineral-rich water. The seawater surrounding hydrothermal vents typically contains carbon dioxide (CO2), molecular hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and methane (CH4). Sunlight, however, fails to reach the seafloor where deep-sea hydrothermal vents are located.\nAs part of an investigation, researchers collected living specimens from an area near a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Mussels in the collection were found to be dependent on molecular hydrogen in seawater. Also, the researchers discovered multiple species of bacteria living in the gills of the mussels. Mussels use gills for filter-feeding and gas exchange with the surrounding seawater. On the basis of their experimental results, the researchers hypothesized that some bacteria living in the gills of the mussels are capable of chemosynthesis.",
