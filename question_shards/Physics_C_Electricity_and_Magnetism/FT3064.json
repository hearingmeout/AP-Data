    "question": "A completely-plated stickleback from a marine population was mated to a low-plated stickleback from a freshwater population. The resulting F1 hybrids all displayed a completely plated phenotype. When the F1 hybrids were allowed to interbreed, the resulting F2 generation included completely plated offspring and low-plated offspring in an approximate 3:1 ratio. Which of the following conclusions is best supported by the results of the breeding experiments?",
