    "description": "Directions: Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case and then fill in the corresponding circle on the answer sheet.\n\nThe three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a small fish found in both marine and freshwater environments. Marine stickleback populations consist mainly of individuals with armor-like plates covering most of their body surface (completely plated). Approximately 10,000 years ago, some marine sticklebacks colonized freshwater environments. After many generations in the freshwater environments, the freshwater stickleback populations lacked the armor plating (low plated) typical of marine stickleback populations.\n\nOver the period between 1957 and 2005, one freshwater population, in Lake Washington, a lake in a coastal region of the northwestern United States, changed from having a majority of individuals of the low-plated phenotype to having more individuals of the completely-plated phenotype than of the low-plated phenotype. Figure 1 shows the distribution of plated phenotypes in Lake Washington sticklebacks at four time points between 1957 and 2005.\n\nA single gene, ectodysplasin (EDA), is thought to be responsible for the variation in the number of armor plates in sticklebacks. Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree constructed by comparing DNA sequences of the EDA gene from a number of stickleback populations with low-plated or completely plated phenotypes. Figure 3 shows a phylogenetic tree constructed by comparing the sequences of 25 genes that were randomly selected from the same populations as shown in Figure 2. In both figures, shaded populations display the completely plated phenotype.",
    "question": "Prior to 1960, Lake Washington was highly polluted and underwater visibility was limited to one or two meters. In the late 1960s, a large cleanup effort reduced pollution, resulting in visibility that increased to six to seven meters by 1976. Which of the following best explains how the change in underwater visibility affected armor plating in Lake Washington sticklebacks between 1957 and 1976?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Higher visibility allowed sticklebacks to increase their food consumption to make armor production easier.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Higher visibility made the sticklebacks more susceptible to large-toothed predators in the lakes, giving complete armor a selective advantage.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Clearer water allowed sunlight to penetrate to deeper depths, so the sticklebacks had to increase the amount of armor to protect themselves from the resulting increase in water temperature.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Clearer water contained fewer of the molecular building blocks needed for armor production, so sticklebacks showed a reduction in the amount of armor.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Higher visibility made the sticklebacks more susceptible to large-toothed predators in the lakes, giving complete armor a selective advantage."
