    "description": "Table I shows the results of breeding experiments to examine the inheritance of flower color (purple versus white) and pod shape (inflated versus constricted). For the crosses recorded in Table I, true-breeding parents were crossed to produce F1 offspring, which were then testcrossed to homozygous recessive individuals. Table II shows the results of computer-simulated crosses to model the inheritance of leaf shape (broad versus narrow) and flower color (purple versus white).",
    "question": "Based on the data in Table I, which of the following best explains why there are no individuals with constricted pods in the F1 generation?",
