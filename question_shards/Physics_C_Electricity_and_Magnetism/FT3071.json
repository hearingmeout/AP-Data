    "description": "Table I shows the results of breeding experiments to examine the inheritance of flower color (purple versus white) and pod shape (inflated versus constricted). For the crosses recorded in Table I, true-breeding parents were crossed to produce F1 offspring, which were then testcrossed to homozygous recessive individuals. Table II shows the results of computer-simulated crosses to model the inheritance of leaf shape (broad versus narrow) and flower color (purple versus white).",
    "question": "In Table I, the ratio of phenotypes in the offspring from the testcross with F1 plants that had purple flowers and inflated pods suggests that the genes for flower color and pod shape are located",
