    "question": "In Table II, the F1 offspring of the cross between broad-leaved, white-flowered plants with narrow-leaved, purple-flowered plants have a phenotype that differs from that of either parent. However, many testcross offspring have the same phenotype as one of the two plants in the parental cross, but relatively few testcross offspring have the same phenotype as the F1 offspring. Which of the following best explains the observation?",
