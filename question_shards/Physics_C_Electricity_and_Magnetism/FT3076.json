    "description": "Wolves, a top predator, were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 after a 50-year absence. In a multiyear study, the numbers of wolves and elk were monitored. The data are shown in Figure 1. In two different environments scientists monitored the percent of aspen trees browsed by herbivores (Figure 2) as well as the growth of the trees (Figure 3). The upland environments consist mostly of flat forested areas. The riparian environments are areas along streams with steep, wooded banks.",
    "question": "Based on the data, which of the following is the best explanation for the changes in the elk population size between 2000 and 2005 ?",
