    "description": "Wolves, a top predator, were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 after a 50-year absence. In a multiyear study, the numbers of wolves and elk were monitored. The data are shown in Figure 1. In two different environments scientists monitored the percent of aspen trees browsed by herbivores (Figure 2) as well as the growth of the trees (Figure 3). The upland environments consist mostly of flat forested areas. The riparian environments are areas along streams with steep, wooded banks.",
    "question": "Which of the following predictions about the community is most likely true?",
