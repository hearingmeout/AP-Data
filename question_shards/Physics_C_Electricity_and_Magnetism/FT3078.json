    "description": "Wolves, a top predator, were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 after a 50-year absence. In a multiyear study, the numbers of wolves and elk were monitored. The data are shown in Figure 1. In two different environments scientists monitored the percent of aspen trees browsed by herbivores (Figure 2) as well as the growth of the trees (Figure 3). The upland environments consist mostly of flat forested areas. The riparian environments are areas along streams with steep, wooded banks.",
    "question": "Based on the data, which of the following behaviors in elk could account for the differences between the percent of aspens browsed by herbivores and the height of aspen trees in riparian and upland environments?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Elk tend to avoid riparian areas where the steep, wooded riverbanks make it difficult to escape predators.",
