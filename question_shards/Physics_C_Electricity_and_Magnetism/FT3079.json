    "description": "Wolves, a top predator, were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 after a 50-year absence. In a multiyear study, the numbers of wolves and elk were monitored. The data are shown in Figure 1. In two different environments scientists monitored the percent of aspen trees browsed by herbivores (Figure 2) as well as the growth of the trees (Figure 3). The upland environments consist mostly of flat forested areas. The riparian environments are areas along streams with steep, wooded banks.",
    "question": "Which of the following models best predicts the effect on the ecosystem if a deadly communicable disease is introduced into the wolf population?",

The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the numbers appearing on it, from left to right, are 2005, 2010, and 2015.  There is one tick mark before 2005, one tick mark after 2015, and one for every year between 2005 and 2015.  The left vertical axis is labeled Wolf Population and has one tick mark on the top end labeled 20.  The right vertical axis is labeled Elk Population and has one tick mark on the top end labeled 120. For each graph, there is a horizontal downward pointing arrow right before the year 2008 that is labeled Disease Introduced. Option A. The solid line representing Wolves starts at approximately three-fourths of the way up the vertical axis at 2004 and moves horizontally right until about 2008 where it moves steeply down and to the right, ending at 2015 approximately one-twentieth of the way up the vertical axis.  The dashed line representing Elk starts at approximately one-fourth of the way up the vertical axis and moves gradually up at 2004 before curving gradually down again at 2005.  The line then moves horizontally right until approximately 2009 where it moves gradually up and to the right, ending on the right vertical axis at a point slightly higher than three-fourths.",
