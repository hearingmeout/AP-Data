    "description": "A biologist spent many years researching the rate of evolutionary change in the finch populations of a group of islands. It was determined that the average beak size (both length and mass) of finches in a certain population increased dramatically during an intense drought between 1981 and 1987. During the drought, there was a reduction in the number of plants producing thin-walled seeds.",
    "question": "Which of the following procedures was most likely followed to determine the change in beak size?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "A few finches were trapped in 1981 and again in 1987, and their beak sizes were compared. \u0003",

        "label": "The beak size in fifteen finches was measured in 1987, and the beak size in the original finches was determined by estimation.",

        "label": "Finches were captured and bred in 1981, and the beak size of the offspring was measured.",
