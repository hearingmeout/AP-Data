  "content": {
    "description": "A biologist spent many years researching the rate of evolutionary change in the finch populations of a group of islands. It was determined that the average beak size (both length and mass) of finches in a certain population increased dramatically during an intense drought between 1981 and 1987. During the drought, there was a reduction in the number of plants producing thin-walled seeds.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements might best explain the increase in average beak size in the finch population during the drought?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Finches with bigger beaks are better able to crack thick-walled seeds and produce more surviving offspring.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Finches with bigger beaks can attack and kill finches with smaller beaks.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Finches with bigger beaks possess more powerful flight muscles and are able to find more food.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Finches that crack large seeds develop larger beaks over time.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Finches with bigger beaks are better able to crack thick-walled seeds and produce more surviving offspring."
