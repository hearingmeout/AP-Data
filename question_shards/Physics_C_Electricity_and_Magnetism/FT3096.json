    "description": "An experiment to measure the rate of respiration in crickets and mice at 10oC and 25oC was performed using a respirometer, an apparatus that measures changes in gas volume. Respiration was measured in mL of O2 consumed per gram of organism over several five-minute trials and the following data were obtained.",
    "question": "According to the data, the mice at 10oC demonstrated greater oxygen consumption per gram of tissue than did the mice at 25oC. This is most likely explained by which of the following statements?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The mice at 10oC had a higher rate of ATP production than the mice at 25oC.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mice at 10oC had a lower metabolic rate than the mice at 25oC.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mice at 25oC weighed less than the mice at 10oC.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The mice at 25oC were more active than the mice at 10oC.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The mice at 10oC had a higher rate of ATP production than the mice at 25oC."
