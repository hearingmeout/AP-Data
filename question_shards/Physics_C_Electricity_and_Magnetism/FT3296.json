    "description": "For following group of questions first study the description of the situation or data and then choose the one best answer to each question following it and fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet.\n\nIn the first step of an experiment, rat liver cells were exposed for 5 minutes to amino acids labeled with a radioactive isotope. The cells were then washed to stop any further incorporation of radioactive amino acids. The cells were sampled periodically thereafter, and the radioactivity of a certain protein (protein X) was measured in various cell components, as shown below.",
