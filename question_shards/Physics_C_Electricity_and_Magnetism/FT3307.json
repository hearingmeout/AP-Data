    "description": "For following group of questions first study the description of the situation and then choose the one best answer to each question following it and fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet.\n\nA survey reveals that 25 percent of a population of 1,000 individuals have attached earlobes (are homozygous recessivefor the trait). For the following questions, assume that the population fits the parameters of the Hardy-Weinberg law.",
