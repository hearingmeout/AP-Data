    "description": "For following group of questions first study the description of the situation and then choose the one best answer to each question following it and fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet.\n\nA survey reveals that 25 percent of a population of 1,000 individuals have attached earlobes (are homozygous recessivefor the trait). For the following questions, assume that the population fits the parameters of the Hardy-Weinberg law.",
    "question": "If p equals the frequency of the dominant allele and q equals the frequency of the recessive allele, which of the following terms represents the frequency of the individuals who show the dominant phenotype?",
