    "description": "For following group of questions first study the description of the situation and diagrams and then choose the one best answer to each question following it and fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet.\n\nA student studied the effects of light intensity on oxygen production in green algae. The algae were suspended in water inside a sealed glass jar, and the jar was placed into a constant-temperature, lightproof box containing a light source. A probe was inserted into the jar to record the concentration of oxygen. The probe was connected to a recording device. The setup is shown below.\n\nThe student decreased the intensity of the light hourly and recorded the corresponding changes in oxygen concentration. The graph below shows the results from the recording device.",
    "question": "Based on the data shown, changes in the light intensity resulted in changes in the rate of which of the following processes?",
