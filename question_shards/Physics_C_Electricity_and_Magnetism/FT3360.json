    "description": "The following questions refer to an experiment in which a dialysis-tubing bag is filled with a mixture of 3% starch and 3% glucose and placed in a beaker of distilled water, as shown below. After 3 hours, glucose can be detected in the water outside the dialysis-tubing bag, but starch cannot.",

    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The initial concentration of glucose in the bag is higher than the initial concentration of starch in the bag.",

      {
        "label": "The pores of the bag are larger than the glucose molecules but smaller than the starch molecules.",
