    "description": "The following questions refer to an experiment in which a dialysis-tubing bag is filled with a mixture of 3% starch and 3% glucose and placed in a beaker of distilled water, as shown below. After 3 hours, glucose can be detected in the water outside the dialysis-tubing bag, but starch cannot.",
    "question": "If, instead of the bag, a potato slice were placed in the beaker of distilled water, which of the following would be true of the potato slice?",
