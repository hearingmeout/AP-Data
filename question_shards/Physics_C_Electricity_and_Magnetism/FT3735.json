    "question": "Simple cuboidal epithelial cells line the ducts of certain human exocrine glands. Various materials are transported into or out of the cells by diffusion. (The formula for the surface area of a cube is 6 X S2, and the formula for the volume of a cube is S3, where S = the length of a side of the cube.)\n\nWhich of the following cube-shaped cells would be most efficient in removing waste by diffusion?",
