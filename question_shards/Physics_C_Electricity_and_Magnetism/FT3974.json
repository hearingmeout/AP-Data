    "question": "In an experiment on the effects of deforestation of a portion of a northern temperate deciduous forest, all the trees were removed from a small mountainside watershed area and herbicides were applied for three years to prevent regrowth. Measurements of the concentration of calcium (an important nutrient) in runoff water were taken both before and after the deforestation. Monthly measurements also were made in a similar watershed in another part of the same forest that had been left undisturbed. The findings are displayed in the graph below.\n\nWhich of the following is best supported by the data?",
