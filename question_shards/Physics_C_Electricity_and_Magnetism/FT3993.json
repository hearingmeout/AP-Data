    "question": "A culture of white-eyed fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) was maintained for many generations. Females from the stock white-eyed culture were crossed with red-eyed (wild-type) males. The F1 females were crossed with the white-eyed males from the original culture. The resulting phenotypes of the progeny are summarized below.\n\nParental Generation Cross\n F1 Generation (at least 500 flies)\n\nWhite-eyed females × red-eyed males\n 100% of females are red-eyed\n\n100% of males are white-eyed\n\nF1 Generation Cross\n\nF2 Generation (at least 500 flies)\n\nF1 red-eyed females × white-eyed males\n\n50% of females are red-eyed and 50% are white-eyed\n\n50% of males are red-eyed and 50% are white-eyed\n\nWhich of the following best describes the mode of inheritance of eye color in the white culture?",
