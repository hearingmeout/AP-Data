    "description": "Directions: Each group of questions below concerns an experimental or a laboratory situation. In each case, first study the description of the situation. Then choose the one best answer to each question following it.\n\nA sterile agar plate, I, is streaked with a pure culture of bacteria by means of aseptic techniques. Paper discs treated with the antibiotics Aureomycin (A) and penicillin (P) are placed at opposite sides of the plate, as shown in the diagram above. The plate is examined after a 24-hour incubation period, and a clear ring is discovered around disc A, but not around disc P. Within the clear ring around disc A, a single bacterial colony with physical characteristics like those of the pure culture is observed. A second sterile agar plate, II, is then streaked with this single colony and also incubated with antibiotics.",
