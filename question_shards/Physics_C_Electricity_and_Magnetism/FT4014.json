    "description": "Directions: Each group of questions below concerns an experimental or a laboratory situation. In each case, first study the description of the situation. Then choose the one best answer to each question following it.\n\nIn dogs, one pair of alleles determines coat color (dark and albino). Another pair of alleles determines hair length (short and long). Thus, each gamete will contain one of the coat-color alleles, C or c and one of the hair-length alleles, B or b. In repeated crosses of a specific dark, short-haired dog with an albino, long-haired dog, all the offspring were dark with short hair, as shown in cross I. However, in subsequent crosses of another dark, short-haired dog with a dark, long-haired dog, the ratios shown in cross II below were obtained.",
