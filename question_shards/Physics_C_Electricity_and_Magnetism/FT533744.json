    "question": "Meiosis occurs in many organisms as part of sexual reproduction. Describe THREE differences between mitosis and meiosis. Discuss TWO differences between gametogenesis in male humans and gametogenesis in female humans. Discuss TWO examples of meiotic errors and their effects on offspring. Describe the sequence of events that make up the alternation of generations in plants. Include an explanation of where mitosis and meiosis occur in the sequence. You may use a labeled diagram as part of your answer.",
