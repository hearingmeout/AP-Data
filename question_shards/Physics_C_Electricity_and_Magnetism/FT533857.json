    "question": "Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) with a wild-type phenotype have gray bodies and red eyes. Certain mutations can cause changes to these traits. Mutant flies may have a black body and/or cinnabar eyes. To study the genetics of these traits, a researcher crossed a true-breeding wild-type male fly (with gray body and red eyes) with a true-breeding female fly with a black body and cinnabar eyes. All of the F1 progeny displayed a wild-type phenotype.\n\nFemale flies from the F1 generation were crossed with true-breeding male flies with black bodies and cinnabar eyes. The table on the next page represents the predicted outcome and the data obtained from the cross. Explain the difference between the expected data and the actual numbers observed.",
