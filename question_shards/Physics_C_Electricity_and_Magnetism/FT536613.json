Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. \nAssume the following: \n\nThe dishes all fit in one load. \n\nThe water coming into the water heater for the sink and into the water heater in the dishwasher is at 50°F.\n\nThe water heaters for the sink and the dishwasher are both 100 percent efficient. \n\nIn one complete cycle, the electric dishwasher uses 10 gallons of water heated to 140°F and the dishwasher also uses 0.500 kilowatt-hour of electrical energy for its mechanical operation. \n\nWashing the dishes by hand requires 20 gallons of water heated to 110°F.\nOther Information: \n1 gallon of water = 8 pounds of water \n1 BTU = the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1°F\n1 kilowatt-hour = 3,400 BTU's \n\n(a) Calculate the total energy (in BTU's) used to heat the water and run the electric dishwasher to wash a load of dishes. \n(b) Calculate the energy (in BTU's) used to heat the water for washing the load of dishes by hand. \n(c) Discuss the economic and environmental costs and benefits of \n\nusing the electric dishwasher (including its manufacture and disposal) \n\nWashing the dishes by hand",
