    "question": "The diagram below represents the pH ranges in which selected aquatic organisms exist. The solid figures represent pH ranges in which the organism thrives. Shaded figures represent pH ranges in which conditions are less favorable, but in which the organism survives. No symbol is placed in a pH range in which that organism cannot survive. Using the diagram and your understanding of environmental principles, answer the following questions. (a) Determine the pH range in which brook trout thrive. To what range of hydrogen-ion concentration, (H+), does this pH range correspond? (b) Which organism(s) might best provide an indication that a lake has changed from pH 5.8 to pH 5.2? Explain. (c) Discuss how pH affects biodiversity in a freshwater community. Consider chemical, physiological, and ecological factors in your answer. (d) Discuss the cause of lake acidifcation and describe potential ways to avoid or remediate it.",
