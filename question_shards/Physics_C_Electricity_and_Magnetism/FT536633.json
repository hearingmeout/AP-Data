    "question": "The map above show the town of Fremont, where biologists have noted that the population of a certain species of bird has been declining over the past several years. This bird species is now found only in the wooded area on the western edge of the city. Developers view this wooded area as prime real estate and have recommended to the Fremont City Council that the area be zoned for single-family housing. A group of citizens concerned about the bird species and its habitat recommended to the council that future urban expansion be directed toward the eastern portion of the city and that the wooded area be preserved. (a) Identify and briefly describe two federal laws or regulations that might apply to this situation. (b) Assume that the Fremont City Council votes to preserve the wooded area. explain the positive and negative consequences of this action. Include long- and short-term effects on the environmental, economic, and recreational needs of the citizens of Fremont. (c) Assume that the Fremont City Council votes against preserving the wooded area. Propose and defend an alternative plan that both protects the bird species and provides for urban expansion.",
