    "description": "The following questions are related to this scenario:\n\nTwo long, straight, parallel wires are held fixed, as shown above. A voltage is applied to wire X, creating a current IX to the right, and the wire experiences a magnetic force of magnitude FB toward wire Y.",
    "question": "Assuming the resistance of wire X is constant, which of the following graphs correctly illustrates the magnitude of the magnetic force F on wire X as a function of the voltage V applied to the wire?",
