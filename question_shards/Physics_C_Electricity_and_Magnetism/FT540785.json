    "description": "The following questions are related to this scenario:\n\nTwo long, straight, parallel wires are held fixed, as shown above. A voltage is applied to wire X, creating a current IX to the right, and the wire experiences a magnetic force of magnitude FB toward wire Y.",
    "question": "If the distance between the two wires is tripled, what is the magnitude of the new magnetic force exerted on wire X?",
