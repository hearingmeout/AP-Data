    "question": "A metal sphere with radius r1 has a total electric charge of magnitude q. An uncharged metal sphere with radius r2 (with r1 > r2) is then connected by a wire to the first sphere, as illustrated above. The separation of the spheres is much greater than the radius of either sphere. When equilibrium is reached, the spheres will have",
