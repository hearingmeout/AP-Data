    "question": "Three resistors having resistances of 3 Ω, 6 Ω, and 9 Ω, respectively, are connected in parallel with a 10 V battery. True statements about the circuit include which of the following? \n\nI. The current in the 9 Ω resistor is three times the current in the 3 Ω resistor. \n\nII. The potential difference across each resistor is the same. \n\nIII. The power dissipated in the 9 Ω resistor is greater than the power dissipated in either of the other two resistors.",
