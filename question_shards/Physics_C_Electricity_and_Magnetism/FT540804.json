    "question": "A loop of wire carrying a steady current I is initially at rest perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of magnitude B, as shown above. The loop is then rotated about a diameter at a constant rate. The torque on the loop is maximum when the loop has rotated, with respect to its initial position, through an angle of",
