    "question": "Two thin, concentric, conducting spherical shells, insulated from each other, have radii of 0.10 m and 0.20 m, as shown above. The inner shell is set at an electric potential of -100 V , and the outer shell is set at an electric potential of +100 V, with each potential defined relative to the conventional reference point. Let Qi and Q0 represent the net charge on the inner and outer shells, respectively, and let r be the radial distance from the center of the shells. Express all algebraic answers in terms of Qi , Qo , r, and fundamental constants, as appropriate. Using Gauss’s Law, derive an algebraic expression for the electric field E(r) for 0.10 m < r < 0.20 m . Determine an algebraic expression for the electric field E(r) for r > 0.20 m . Determine an algebraic expression for the electric potential V(r) for r > 0.20 m . Using the numerical information given, calculate the value of the total charge QT on the two spherical shells (QT = Qi + Q0) . On the axes below, sketch the electric field E as a function of r. Let the positive direction be radially outward. On the axes below, sketch the electric potential V as a function of r .",
