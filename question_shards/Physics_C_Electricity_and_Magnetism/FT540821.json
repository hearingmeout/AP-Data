    "question": "A closed loop is made of a U-shaped metal wire of negligible resistance and a movable metal crossbar of resistance R. The crossbar has mass m and length L. It is initially located a distance h0 from the other end of the loop. The loop is placed vertically in a uniform horizontal magnetic field of magnitude B0 in the direction shown in the figure above. Express all algebraic answers to the questions below in terms of B0 , L, m, h0 , R, and fundamental constants, as appropriate.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the magnetic flux through the loop when the crossbar is in the position shown.\n\nThe crossbar is released from rest and slides with negligible friction down the U-shaped wire without losing electrical contact.\nOn the figure below, indicate the direction of the current in the crossbar as it falls.\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the current in the crossbar as it falls as a function of the crossbar’s speed v.\n\nDerive, but do NOT solve, the differential equation that could be used to determine the speed v of the crossbar as a function of time t.\n\nDetermine the terminal speed vT of the crossbar.\n\nIf the resistance R of the crossbar is increased, does the terminal speed increase, decrease, or remain the same?\n____ Increases ____ Decreases ____ Remains the same\nGive a physical justification for your answer in terms of the forces on the crossbar.",
