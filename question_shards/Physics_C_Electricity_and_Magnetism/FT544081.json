    "question": "Circuit boards are assembled by selecting 4 computer chips at random from a large batch of chips. In this batch of chips, 90 percent of the chips are acceptable. Let X denote the number of acceptable chips out of a sample of 4 chips from this batch. What is the least probable value of X?",
