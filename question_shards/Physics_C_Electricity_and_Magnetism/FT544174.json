    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as the accuracy of your results and explanation.The table of data above provides the cumulative proportions for the United States population at selected ages for the years 1900 and 2000 (projected). For example, 0.344 or 34.4 percent of the population was at or under age 15 in 1900, while only 0.209 or 20.9 percent will be at or under age 15 in the year 2000. The graph below shows the cumulative proportions plotted against age for the years 1900 and 2000 (projected). The data and graph are to be used to compare the age distribution for the year 1900 with the projected age distribution for the year 2000.Approximate the median age for each distribution.Approximate the interquartile range for each distribution.Using the results from parts (a) and (b), write a sentence or two for a history textbook comparing the age distribution for the years 1900 and 2000.",
