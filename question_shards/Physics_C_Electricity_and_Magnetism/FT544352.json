    "question": "George and Michelle each claimed to have the better recipe for chocolate chip cookies. They decided to conduct a study to determine whose cookies were really better. They each baked a batch of cookies using their own recipe. George asked a random sample of his friends to taste his cookies and to complete a questionnaire on their quality. Michelle asked a random sample of her friends to complete the same questionnaire for her cookies. They then compared the results. Which of the following statements about this study is false?",
