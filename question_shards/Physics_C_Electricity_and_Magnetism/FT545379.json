    "question": "A circular ring made of an insulating material is cut in half. One half is given a charge –𝑞 uniformly distributed along its arc. The other half is given a charge +𝑞 also uniformly distributed along its arc. The two halves are then rejoined with insulation at the junctions 𝑱 , as shown above. If there is no change in the charge distributions, what is the direction of the net electrostatic force on an electron located at the center of the circle?",
