    "question": "The power dissipated in a wire carrying a constant electric current 𝐼 may be written as a function of 𝐼 , the length 𝓵 of the wire, the diameter 𝑑 of the wire, and the resistivity of 𝑝 of the material in the wire. In this expression, the power dissipated is directly proportional to which of the following?",
