    "question": "A conducting sphere of radius 𝑅 carries a charge 𝑄 . Another conducting sphere has a radius 𝑅/2, but carries the same charge. The spheres are far apart. The ratio of the electric field near the surface of the smaller sphere to the field near the surface of the larger sphere is most nearly",
