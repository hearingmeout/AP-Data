    "question": "Two metal spheres that are initially uncharged are mounted on insulating stands, as shown above. A negatively charged rubber rod is brought close to, but does not make contact with, sphere X. Sphere Y is then brought close to X on the side opposite to the rubber rod. Y is allowed to touch X and then is removed some distance away. The rubber rod is then moved far away from X and Y. What are the final charges on the spheres?",
