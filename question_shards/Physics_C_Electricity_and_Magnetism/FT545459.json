    "question": "Two initially uncharged conductors, 1 and 2, are mounted on insulating stands and are in contact, as shown above. A negatively charged rod is brought near but does not touch them. With the rod held in place, conductor 2 is moved to the right by pushing its stand, so that the conductors are separated. Which of the following is now true of conductor 2?",
