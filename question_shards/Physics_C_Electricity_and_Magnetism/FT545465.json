    "question": "• If there is no response or if an answering machine is reached, another number is automatically called.• If a person answers, a survey worker verifies that the person is at least 18 years of age.• If the person is not at least 18 years of age, no response is recorded, and another number is called.• If the person is at least 18 years of age, that person is surveyed.Some people claim the procedure being used does not permit the results to be extended to all registered voters. Which of the following is NOT a legitimate concern about the procedure being used?",
