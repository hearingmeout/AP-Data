    "question": "A beam of protons moves parallel to the x-axis in the positive x-direction, as shown above, through a region of crossed electric and magnetic fields balanced for zero deflection of the beam. If the magnetic field is pointed in the positive y-direction, in what direction must the electric field be pointed?",
