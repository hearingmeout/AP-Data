    "description": "Two concentric spherical surfaces are drawn around an isolated positive charge +q located at their center, as shown above. The inner surface has a radius that is 1/2 that of the outer surface.",
    "question": "If the total electric flux passing through the inner surface is 𝜙 , what is the total electric flux passing through the outer surface?",
