    "question": "A small positively charged sphere is lowered by a nonconducting thread into a grounded metal cup without touching the inside surface of the cup, as shown above. The grounding wire attached to the outside surface is disconnected and the charged sphere is then removed from the cup. Which of the following best describes the subsequent distribution of excess charge on the surface of the cup?",
