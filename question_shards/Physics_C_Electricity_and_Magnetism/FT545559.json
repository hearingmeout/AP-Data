  "content": {
    "description": "An emf of 20 V is induced around a metal ring by increasing a uniform magnetic field at a constant rate from zero to a final magnitude of 1.0 × 10–2 T throughout the region enclosed by the ring. The field direction is perpendicular to the plane of the ring.",
    "question": "If the area enclosed by the ring is 4.0 × 10–3 m2 , what is the time interval during which the field is increased?",
