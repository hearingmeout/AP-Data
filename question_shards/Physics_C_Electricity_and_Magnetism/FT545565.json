    "question": "In the circuit drawn above, the switch S is initially open, and the capacitor C is charged with the polarity indicated. The switch is then closed, and the capacitor begins discharging through the resistor. Which of the following is true of the current that is subsequently induced in the circular wire loop near the long, straight wire AB ?",
