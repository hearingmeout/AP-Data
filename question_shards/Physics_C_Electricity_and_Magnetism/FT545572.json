    "question": "Two parallel, straight conductors carry currents 3I and I in the same direction, as shown in the figure above. A plastic meterstick is held against the wires so that they are positioned at the 0.3 m and 0.7 m mark, respectively. At what position on the meterstick is the magnetic field zero?",
