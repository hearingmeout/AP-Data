    "question": "Two long, straight wires are fixed parallel to one another a distance d0 apart. The wires carry equal constant currents I0 in the same direction. The attractive magnetic force per unit length between them is f = F/L . What is the force per unit length between the wires if their separation is 2d0 and each carries current 2I0 ?",
