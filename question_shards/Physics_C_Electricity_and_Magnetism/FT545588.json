    "question": "Suppose that the magnetic field due to a very long straight wire carrying current I has magnitude B0 at a distance r0 from the wire. If the wire is bent into a right angle and placed on the xy-axes as shown above, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P on the x-axis at a distance of r0 from the bend is most nearly",
