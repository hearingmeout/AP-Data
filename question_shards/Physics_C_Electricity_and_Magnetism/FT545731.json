    "question": "A company currently uses Brand A lightbulbs, which have a mean life of 1,000 hours. A salesperson marketing Brand B, a new brand of bulb, contacts the company. The company will switch to the new brand of bulb only if there is convincing evidence that the mean life of Brand B is greater than 1,000 hours. Which of the following hypotheses should the company test?",
