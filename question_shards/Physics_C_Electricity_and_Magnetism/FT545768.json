    "question": "The plates of a parallel-plate capacitor of cross-sectional area A are separated by a distance d, as shown above. Between the plates is a dielectric material of constant K. The plates are connected in series with a variable resistance R and a power supply of potential difference V. The capacitance C of this capacitor will increase if which of the following is decreased?",
