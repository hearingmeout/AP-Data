    "question": "A sheet of copper in the plane of the page is connected to a battery as shown above, causing electrons to drift through the copper toward the bottom of the page. The copper sheet is in a magnetic field B directed into the page. P1 and P2 are points at the edges of the strip. Which of the following statements is true?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "P1 is at a higher potential than P2.",
