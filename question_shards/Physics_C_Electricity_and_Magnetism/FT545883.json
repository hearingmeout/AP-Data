    "question": "A small, circular loop of conducting wire is near a long, straight wire that carries a steady electric current I to the right, as shown above. Which of the following actions will result in a clockwise induced electric current in the wire loop?\n\nThe wire loop is pulled vertically upward in the plane of the page (away from the wire) at a constant speed.\n\nThe current in the straight wire is steadily increasing.\n\nThe wire loop is rotated about a diameter through a small angle so that it is no longer in the plane of the page.",
