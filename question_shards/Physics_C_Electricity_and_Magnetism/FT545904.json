    "question": "A negatively charged rod is brought near a metal object on an insulating stand, as shown above. When charges stop moving, the left side of the object has an excess of positive charge, and the right side of the object, where the radius of curvature is less, has an excess of negative charge. Which of the following best describes the electric potential on the metal object?",
