    "question": "The circular wire loop shown above has resistance 30 𝛀 and area 3.0 m2, and is fixed in position in the plane of the page. A uniform magnetic field B is directed perpendicularly into the plane of the page. The constant rate at which the magnetic field would have to change in order to induce a current of 1.0 mA in this loop is most nearly",
