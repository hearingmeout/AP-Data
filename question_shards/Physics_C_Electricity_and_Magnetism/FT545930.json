    "question": "A proton p and an electron e are released simultaneously on opposite sides of an evacuated area between large, charged parallel plates, as shown above. Each particle is accelerated toward the oppositely charged plate. The particles are far enough apart so that they do not affect each other. Which particle has the greater kinetic energy upon reaching the oppositely charged plate?",
