    "question": "A bar magnet is lowered at constant speed through a loop of wire as shown in the diagram above. The time at which the midpoint of the bar magnet passes through the loop is t1. Which of the following graphs best represents the time dependence of the induced current in the loop? (A positive current represents a counterclockwise current in the loop as viewed from above.)",
