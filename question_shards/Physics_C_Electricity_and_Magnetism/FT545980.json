    "question": "A long, cylindrical conductor with inner radius a and outer radius b carries a current I distributed uniformly over its cross section (the shaded region shown above). Which of the following graphs best shows the magnitude of the magnetic field B as a function of the distance r from the axis of the conductor?",
