    "question": "A uniform magnetic field vector B is directed out of the page, as represented above. A loop of wire of area 0.8 m2 is in the plane of the page. At a certain instant, the field has a magnitude of 5.0 T and is decreasing at the rate of 0.5 T/s. The magnitude of the induced emf in the wire loop at this instant is most nearly",
