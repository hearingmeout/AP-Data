    "question": "A permanent magnet of mass M is dropped down the interior of a hollow cylindrical tube made of copper, as shown at left in the figure above. Friction between the inside of the tube and the magnet is negligible. As the magnet moves downward, an upward magnetic force FB is induced, and the magnet’s velocity quickly reaches a constant terminal value vT. A nonmagnetic object of mass M is attached to the permanent magnet and the drop is repeated, as shown at right in the figure above. When terminal velocity is reached, how do the new values of FB and vT compare with their values without the object?",

      {
        "label": "FB and vT are the same.",
