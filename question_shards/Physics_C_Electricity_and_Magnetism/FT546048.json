    "description": "Two identical rectangular conducting loops and a very long, straight wire lie in the plane of the page, as shown above. The loops are equal distances from the wire, and there is a current to the right in the wire.",
    "question": "If the current in the wire is constant and the wire is moved toward loop X, what is the direction of the induced current, if any, in each of the loops?",
