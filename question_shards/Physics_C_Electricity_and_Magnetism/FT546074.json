    "description": "A capacitor is constructed of two large, identical, parallel metal plates separated by a small distance d. A battery fully charges the capacitor and is then disconnected.",
    "question": "If, instead of separating the plates, the empty space between the plates is filled with a slab of insulating material that has a dielectric constant K = 2, which of the following correctly describes the change, if any, of the voltage across the capacitor, the electric field between the plates, and the energy stored in the capacitor?",
