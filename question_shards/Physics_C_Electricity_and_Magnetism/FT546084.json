    "question": "A nonconducting sphere of radius R has a uniform volume charge density 𝝆. At the surface of the sphere, the electric field strength is E. If a second sphere of radius 2R was created of the same material and with the same charge density, what would be the strength of the electric field at the surface of the second sphere?",
