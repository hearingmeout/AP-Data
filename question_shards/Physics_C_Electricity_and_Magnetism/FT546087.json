    "description": "The figure above shows a thin, circular nonconducting sheet of positive charge uniformly distributed over its area. The radius of the sheet is R. Point O is at the center of the sheet. Point S is a distance x from the center of the sheet, and point T is a distance 4x from the center of the sheet. Assume R ≫ x.",
    "question": "If the magnitude of the electric field at point T is ET , which of the following best represents the magnitude of the electric field at point S ?",
