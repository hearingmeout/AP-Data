    "question": "The middle sections of two long, straight wires are each bent into semicircular shapes. The two wires are placed close to each other in a plane as shown above. Point A is the center of the circle formed by the two wires. There is a current I in each wire. Which of the following best represents the direction of the magnetic field, if any, at point A due to the currents?",
