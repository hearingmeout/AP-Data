The magnetic field region ends at the dashed line, as shown in the figure above. Later, the loop is at location Y and exiting the magnetic field with the same constant speed v. The process is then repeated with the loop moving at a speed of 2v. Which of the following best describes the emf in the loop at the two positions shown when the process is repeated at a speed of 2v?",
