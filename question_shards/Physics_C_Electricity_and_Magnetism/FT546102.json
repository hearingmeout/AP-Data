    "question": "A long solenoid has 300 loops. The region inside the solenoid has a uniform magnetic field that is directed parallel to the axis of the solenoid. Each loop has an area 2 × 10–4 m2 . The magnetic field decreases at a constant rate from 0.5 T to zero. What is the time duration for the change in magnetic field if a potential difference of 10 V is induced between the ends of the solenoid while the field is decreasing?",
