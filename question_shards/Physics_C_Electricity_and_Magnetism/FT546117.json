    "question": "A small object with a charge of q = +3.0 µC and a mass m = 2.0 × 10–6 kg enters a magnetic field of magnitude B = 0.20 T directed into the page, as shown in the figure above. If the speed of the object is 1000 m/s, the object's acceleration at the moment it enters the field is most nearly",
