    "question": "Uniform magnetic and electric fields exist between the two oppositely charged parallel plates shown in the figure above. An electron travels horizontally between the plates. Assuming gravitational effects to be negligible, which of the following diagrams shows a combination of electric and magnetic field directions that will allow the electron to travel undeflected?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The figure shows two parallel plates, with the area between them filled with a field of rows and columns of x’s.  Arrows pointing straight down extend from the top plate to the bottom plate.",
