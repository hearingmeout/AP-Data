    "question": "A recent study examined 699 car accidents in Toronto over a fourteen-month period. Records of phone-service providers were used to determine whether the driver was using a cell phone during or immediately before the accident. Overall, the researchers found that drivers using cell phones were 4.3 times as likely to have an accident as drivers who were not using cell phones. The result was statistically significant. Which of the following can be concluded from this study?",
