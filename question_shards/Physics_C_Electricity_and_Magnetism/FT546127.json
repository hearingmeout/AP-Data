    "question": "Two identical capacitors, Y and Z, are connected in series with an ideal battery, as shown in figure 1 above, and fully charged. Each capacitor has a dielectric slab of dielectric constant 𝜅 > 1 between its plates. If the dielectric slab is removed from capacitor Z, which of the following describes what happens to the voltage across each capacitor?",
