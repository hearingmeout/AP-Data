    "question": "A particle of charge +q is released from rest at position B, which is a distance 2d from the center of a fixed nonconducting sphere that has a charge of –Q distributed uniformly throughout its volume, as shown in the figure above. When the particle reaches position A, which is a distance d from the center of the charged sphere, its kinetic energy is K0. The same particle is now released from rest at position C, which is a distance 4d from the center of the nonconducting sphere. The kinetic energy of the particle when it again reaches position A is",
