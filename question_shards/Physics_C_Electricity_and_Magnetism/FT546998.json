    "description": "Frank, who lives in Texas, and his sister Lilly, who lives in Japan, correspond regularly. From what he can tell from the postmarks on both his and his sister’s letters, it appears that it takes longer for Lilly’s mail from Japan to reach him in Texas than it does for his letters from Texas to reach her in Japan. When Frank called his post office to ask if there was a reason for this, the postmaster told him that the delivery time of letters in both directions should be the same. Frank and his sister decided to collect data to see if letters from Japan to Texas take longer to be delivered than letters from Texas to Japan. They recorded the delivery time in days. After convincing themselves that the assumptions were reasonable, they performed a two-sample t-test and obtained the following computer output.",
    "question": "Using a significance level of 0.05, which of the following statements best describes the conclusion that can be drawn from these data?",
