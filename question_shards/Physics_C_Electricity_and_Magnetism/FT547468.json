    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem was written for The North Star, a nineteenth-century antislavery newspaper. The North Star was founded and edited by African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who had escaped slavery in Maryland by fleeing to the North.\n\nThe North Star\n\nStar of the North! whose steadfast ray\n\nPierces the sable pall of night,\n\nForever pointing out the way\n\nThat leads to freedom’s hallowed light:\n\n(5)   The fugitive lifts up his eye\n\nTo where thy rays illume the sky.\n\nThat steady, calm, unchanging light,\n\nThrough dreary wilds and trackless dells,\n\nDirects his weary steps aright\n\n(10)   To the bright land where freedom dwells;\n\nAnd spreads, with sympathizing breast,\n\nHer aegis over the oppressed;\n\nThough other stars may round thee burn,\n\nWith larger disk and brighter ray,\n\n(15)   And fiery comets round thee turn,\n\nWhile millions mark their blazing way;\n\nAnd the pale moon and planets bright\n\nReflect on us their silvery light.\n\nNot like that moon, now dark, now bright,\n\n(20)   In phase and place forever changing;\n\nOr planets with reflected light,\n\nOr comets through the heavens ranging;\n\nThey all seem varying in our view,\n\nWhile thou art ever fixed and true.\n\n(25)    So may that other bright North Star,\n\nBeaming with truth and freedom’s light,\n\nPierce with its cheering ray afar;\n\nThe shades of slavery’s gloomy night;\n\nAnd may it never cease to be\n\n(30)   The guard of truth and liberty.\n\n(1853)",
