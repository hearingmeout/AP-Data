    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nTheir Lonely Betters\n\nAs I listened from a beach-chair in the shade\n\nTo all the noises that my garden made,\n\nIt seemed to me only proper that words\n\nShould be withheld from vegetables and birds.\n\n(5)   A robin with no Christian name ran through\n\nThe Robin-Anthem which was all it knew,\n\nAnd rustling flowers for some third party waited\n\nTo say which pairs, if any, should get mated.\n\nNot one of them was capable of lying,\n\n(10)   There was not one which knew that it was dying\n\nOr could have with a rhythm or a rhyme\n\nAssumed responsibility for time.\n\nLet them leave language to their lonely betters\n\nWho count some days and long for certain letters;\n\n(15)   We, too, make noises when we laugh or weep:\n\nWords are for those with promises to keep.\n\n“Their Lonely Betters,” copyright 1951 by W.
