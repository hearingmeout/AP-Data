    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. \n\nThe Triple Fool\n\nI am two fools, I know,\n\nFor loving, and for saying so\n\nIn whining poetry;\n\nBut where’s that wise man, that would not be I,\n\n(5)       If she would not deny?\n\nThen as th’ earth’s inward narrow crooked lanes\n\nDo purge sea water’s fretful salt away,\n\nI thought, if I could draw my pains\n\nThrough rhyme’s vexation, I should them allay.\n\n(10)      Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce,\n\nFor he tames it, that fetters it in verse.\n\nBut when I have done so,\n\nSome man, his art and voice to show,\n\nDoth set and sing my pain;\n\n(15)   And, by delighting many, frees again\n\nGrief, which verse did restrain.\n\nTo love and grief tribute of verse belongs,\n\nBut not of such as pleases when ’tis read.\n\nBoth are increasèd by such songs,\n\n(20)   For both their triumphs so are published,\n\nAnd I, which was two fools, do so grow three.\n\nWho are a little wise, the best fools be.",
