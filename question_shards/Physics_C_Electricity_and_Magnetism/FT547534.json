    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nTo the Same Flower1\n\nWith little here to do or see\n\nOf things that in the great world be,\n\nDaisy! again I talk to thee,\n\nFor thou art worthy,\n\n(5)   Thou unassuming Common-place\n\nOf Nature, with that homely face,\n\nAnd yet with something of a grace,\n\nWhich Love makes for thee!\n\nOft on the dappled turf at ease\n\n(10)     I sit, and play with similes,\n\nLoose types of things through all degrees,\n\nThoughts of thy raising:\n\nAnd many a fond and idle name\n\nI give to thee, for praise or blame,\n\n(15)     As is the humour of the game,\n\nWhile I am gazing.\n\nA nun demure of lowly port;\n\nOr sprightly maiden, of Love’s court,\n\nIn thy simplicity the sport\n\n(20)       Of all temptations;\n\nA queen in crown of rubies drest;\n\nA starveling in a scanty vest;\n\nAre all, as seems to suit thee best,\n\nThy appellations.\n\n(25)   A little cyclops, with one eye\n\nStaring to threaten and defy,\n\nThat thought comes next—and instantly\n\nThe freak2 is over,\n\nThe shape will vanish—and behold\n\n(30)     A silver shield with boss of gold,\n\nThat spreads itself, some faery bold\n\nIn fight to cover!\n\nI see thee glittering from afar—\n\nAnd then thou art a pretty star;\n\n(35)     Not quite so fair as many are\n\nIn heaven above thee!\n\nYet like a star, with glittering crest,\n\nSelf-poised in air thou seem’st to rest;—\n\nMay peace come never to his nest,\n\n(40)        Who shall reprove thee!\n\nBright Flower! for by that name at last,\n\nWhen all my reveries are past,\n\nI call thee, and to that cleave fast,\n\nSweet silent creature!\n\n(45)   That breath’st with me in sun and air,\n\nDo thou, as thou art wont, repair\n\nMy heart with gladness, and a share\n\nOf thy meek nature!\n\n(1807)\n\n1 This poem is part of a series of three daisy poems, each of which is sometimes published with the title “To the Daisy.”\n\n2 whim",
