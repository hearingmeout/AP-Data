    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe Fair Singer\n\nTo make a final conquest of all me,\n\nLove did compose so sweet an enemy,\n\nIn whom both beauties to my death agree,\n\nJoining themselves in fatal harmony;\n\n(5)     That while she with her eyes my heart does bind,\n\nShe with her voice might captivate my mind.\n\nI could have fled from one but singly fair:\n\nMy disentangled soul itself might save,\n\nBreaking the curlèd trammels of her hair.\n\n(10)   But how should I avoid to be her slave,\n\nWhose subtle art invisibly can wreathe\n\nMy fetters of the very air I breathe?\n\nIt had been easy fighting in some plain,\n\nWhere victory might hang in equal choice,\n\n(15)   Who has th’ advantage both of eyes and voice,\n\nBut all resistance against her is vain,\n\nAnd all my forces needs must be undone,\n\nShe having gainèd both the wind and sun.\n\n(1681)",
