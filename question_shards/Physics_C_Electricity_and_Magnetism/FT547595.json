    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nA January Dandelion\n\nAll Nashville is a-chill! And everywhere,\n\nAs wind-swept sands upon the deserts blow,\n\nThere is, each moment, sifted through the air\n\nA powered blast of January snow.\n\n5O thoughtless dandelion! to be misled\n\nBy a few warm days to leave thy natural bed\n\nWas folly growth and blooming over soon.\n\nAnd yet, thou blasted, yellow-coated gem!\n\nFull many hearts have but a common boon\n\n10With thee, now freezing on thy slender stem.\n\nWhen once the heart-blooms by love’s fervid breath\n\nIs left, and chilling snow is sifted in,\n\nIt still may beat, but there is blast and death\n\nTo all that blooming life that might have been.\n\n(1916)",
