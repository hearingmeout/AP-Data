    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. \n\nSong\n\nSweetest love, I do not go\n\nFor weariness of thee,\n\nNor in hope the world can show\n\nA fitter love for me;\n\n(5)                 But since that I\n\nMust die at last, ’tis best\n\nTo use myself in jest,\n\nThus by feigned deaths to die.\nYesternight the sun went hence,\n\n(10)        And yet is here today;\n\nHe hath no desire nor sense,\n\nNor half so short a way:\n\nThen fear not me,\n\nBut believe that I shall make\n\n(15)   Speedier journeys, since I take\n\nMore wings and spurs than he.\n\nO how feeble is man’s power,\n\nThat if good fortune fall,\n\nCannot add another hour,\n\n(20)      Nor a lost hour recall!\n\nBut come bad chance,\n\nAnd we join to it our strength,\n\nAnd we teach it art and length,\n\nItself o’er us to advance.\n\n(25)   When thou sigh’st, thou sigh’st not wind,\n\nBut sigh’st my soul away;\n\nWhen thou weep’st, unkindly kind,\n\nMy life’s blood doth decay.\n\nIt cannot be\n\n(30)       That thou lov’st me, as thou say’st,\n\nIf in thine my life thou waste;\n\nThou art the best of me.\n\nLet not thy divining heart\n\nForethink me any ill;\n\n(35)      Destiny may take thy part,\n\nAnd may thy fears fulfill;\n\nBut think that we\n\nAre but turned aside to sleep;\n\n(40)   They who one another keep\n\nAlive, ne’er parted be.\n\n(1633)",
