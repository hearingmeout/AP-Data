    "description": "Read the following excerpt carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nA little learning is a dangerous thing;\n\nDrink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.*\n\nThere shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,\n\nAnd drinking largely sobers us again.\n\n(5)    Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts,\n\nIn fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts,\n\nWhile from the bounded level of our mind\n\nShort views we take, nor see the lengths behind;\n\nBut more advanced, behold with strange surprise\n\n(10)    New distant scenes of endless science rise!\n\nSo pleased at first the towering Alps we try,\n\nMount o’er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,\n\nTh’ eternal snows appear already past,\n\nAnd the first clouds and mountains seem the last;\n\n(15)    But, those attained, we tremble to survey\n\nThe growing labors of the lengthened way,\n\nTh’ increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes,\n\nHills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!\n\nA perfect judge will read each work of wit\n\n(20)    With the same spirit that its author writ:\n\nSurvey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find\n\nWhere nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;\n\nNor lose, for that malignant dull delight,\n\nThe generous pleasure to be charmed with wit.\n\n(25)    But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow,\n\nCorrectly cold, and regularly low,\n\nThat shunning faults, one quiet tenor keep,\n\nWe cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep.\n\nIn wit, as nature, what affects our hearts\n\n(30)    Is not th’ exactness of peculiar parts;\n\n‘Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,\n\nBut the joint force and full result of all.\n\nThus when we view some well-proportioned dome,\n\n(The world’s just wonder, and even thine, O Rome!)\n\nNo single parts unequally surprise,\n\nAll comes united to th’ admiring eyes;\n\nNo monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;\n\nThe whole at once is bold, and regular.\n\nWhoever thinks a faultless piece to see,\n\n(40)    Thinks what ne’er was, nor is, nor e’er shall be.\n\nIn every work regard the writer’s end,\n\nSince none can compass more than they intend;\n\nAnd if the means be just, the conduct true,\n\nApplause, in spite of trivial faults, is due;\n\n(45)    As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,\n\nT’ avoid great errors, must the less commit:\n\nNeglect the rules each verbal critic lays,\n\nFor not to know some trifles, is a praise.\n\nMost critics, fond of some subservient art,\n\n(50)    Still make the whole depend upon a part:\n\nThey talk of principles, but notions prize,\n\nAnd all to one loved folly sacrifice.\n\n(1711)\n\n* a spring sacred to the Muses",
