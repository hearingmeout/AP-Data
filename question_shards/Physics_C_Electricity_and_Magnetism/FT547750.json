    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nAdvice to a Prophet\n\nWhen you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city,\n\nMad-eyed from stating the obvious,\n\nNot proclaiming our fall but begging us\n\nIn God’s name to have self-pity,\n\n(5)   Spare us all word of the weapons, their force and range,\n\nThe long numbers that rocket the mind;\n\nOur slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind,\n\nUnable to fear what is too strange.\n\nNor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race.\n\n(10)   How should we dream of this place without us?–\n\nThe sun mere fire, the leaves untroubled about us,\n\nA stone look on the stone’s face?\n\nSpeak of the world’s own change. Though we cannot conceive\n\nOf an undreamt thing, we know to our cost\n\n(15)   How the dreamt cloud crumbles, the vines are blackened by frost,\n\nHow the view alters. We could believe,\n\nIf you told us so, that the white-tailed deer will slip\n\nInto perfect shade, grown perfectly shy,\n\nThe lark avoid the reaches of our eye,\n\n(20)   The jack-pine lose its knuckled grip\n\nOn the cold ledge, and every torrent burn\n\nAs Xanthus* once, its gliding trout\n\nStunned in a twinkling. What should we be without\n\nThe dolphin’s arc, the dove’s return,\n\n(25)   These things in which we have seen ourselves and spoken?\n\nAsk us, prophet, how we shall call\n\nOur natures forth when that live tongue is all\n\nDispelled, that glass obscured or broken\n\nIn which we have said the rose of our love and the clean\n\n(30)   Horse of our courage, in which beheld\n\nThe singing locust of the soul unshelled,\n\nAnd all we mean or wish to mean.\n\nAsk us, ask us whether with the worldless rose\n\nOur hearts shall fail us; come demanding\n\n(35)   Whether there shall be lofty or long standing\n\nWhen the bronze annals of the oak-tree close.\n\n* in Greek myth, a river scalded by Hephaestus, god of fire\n\n“Advice to a Prophet” in ADVICE TO A PROPHET AND OTHER POEMS, copyright © 1959 and renewed 1987 by Richard Wilbur, reproduced by permission of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.
