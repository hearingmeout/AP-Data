    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\n\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end;\n\nEach changing place with that which goes before,\n\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\n\n(5)     Nativity, once in the main of light,\n\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\n\nCrooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight,\n\nAnd Time that gave doth now his gift confound.\n\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth\n\n(10)   And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,\n\nFeeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,\n\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\n\nAnd yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\n\nPraising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\n\n(1609)",
