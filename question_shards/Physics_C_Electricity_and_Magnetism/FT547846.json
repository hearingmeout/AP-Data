    "description": "Read the following excerpt carefully before you choose your answers. \n\nYonder’s a work now, of that famous youth\n\nThe Urbinate1 who died five years ago.\n\n(’Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)\n\nWell, I can fancy how he did it all,\n\n(5) Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,\n\nReaching, that heaven might so replenish him,\n\nAbove and through his art—for it gives way;\n\nThat arm is wrongly put—and there again—\n\nA fault to pardon in the drawing’s lines,\n\n(10) Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,\n\nHe means right—that, a child may understand.\n\nStill, what an arm! and I could alter it:\n\nBut all the play, the insight and the stretch—\n\nOut of me, out of me! And wherefore out?\n\n(15) Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,\n\nWe might have risen to Rafael, I and you!\n\nNay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think—\n\nMore than I merit, yes, by many times.\n\nBut had you—oh, with the same perfect brow,\n\n(20) And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,\n\nAnd the low voice my soul hears, as a bird\n\nThe fowler’s pipe, and follows to the snare—\n\nHad you, with these the same, but brought a mind!\n\nSome women do so. Had the mouth there urged\n\n(25) “God and the glory! never care for gain.\n\nThe present by the future, what is that?\n\nLive for fame, side by side with Agnolo!2\n\nRafael is waiting: up to God, all three!”\n\nI might have done it for you. So it seems:\n\n(30) Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules.\n\nBeside, incentives come from the soul’s self;\n\nThe rest avail not. Why do I need you?\n\nWhat wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?\n\nIn this world, who can do a thing, will not;\n\n(35) And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:\n\nYet the will’s somewhat—somewhat, too, the power—\n\nAnd thus we half-men struggle. At the end,\n\nGod, I conclude, compensates, punishes.\n\n’Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,\n\n(40) That I am something underrated here,\n\nPoor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.\n\n[. . .]\n\nIf you would sit thus by me every night\n\nI should work better, do you comprehend?\n\nI mean that I should earn more, give you more.\n\n(45) See, it is settled dusk now; there’s a star;\n\nMorello’s3 gone, the watch-lights show the wall,\n\nThe cue-owls speak the name we call them by.\n\nCome from the window, love,—come in, at last,\n\nInside the melancholy little house\n\n(50) We built to be so gay with. God is just.\n\n(1855)\n\n1Rafael, Italian painter (1483-1520)\n\n2Michelangelo, Italian painter and sculptor (1475-1564)\n\n3A mountain north of Florence",
