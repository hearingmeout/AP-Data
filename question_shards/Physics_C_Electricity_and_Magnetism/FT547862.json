    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe Race\n\nWhen I got to the airport I rushed up to the desk,\n\nbought a ticket, ten minutes later\n\nthey told me the flight was cancelled, the doctors\n\nhad said my father would not live through the night\n\n(5) and the flight was cancelled. A young man\n\nwith a dark blond moustache told me\n\nanother airline had a non-stop\n\nleaving in seven minutes. See that\n\nelevator over there, well go\n\n(10) down to the first floor, make a right, you’ll\n\nsee a yellow bus, get off at the\n\nsecond Pan Am terminal, I\n\nran, I who have no sense of direction\n\nraced exactly where he’d told me, a fish\n\n(15) slipping upstream deftly against\n\nthe flow of the river. I jumped off that bus with those\n\nbags I had thrown everything into\n\nin five minutes, and ran, the bags\n\nwagged me from side to side as if\n\n(20) to prove I was under the claims of the material,\n\nI ran up to a man with a white flower on his breast,\n\nI who always go to the end of the line, I said\n\nHelp me. He looked at my ticket, he said\n\nMake a left and then a right, go up the moving stairs and then\n\n(25) run. I lumbered up the moving stairs,\n\nat the top I saw the corridor,\n\nand then I took a deep breath, I said\n\nGoodbye to my body, goodbye to comfort,\n\nI used my legs and heart as if I would\n\n(30) gladly use them up for this,\n\nto touch him again in this life. I ran, and the\n\nbags banged me, wheeled and coursed\n\nin skewed orbits, I have seen pictures of\n\nwomen running, their belongings tied\n\n(35) in scarves grasped in their fists, I blessed my\n\nlong legs he gave me, my strong\n\nheart I abandoned to its own purpose,\n\nI ran to Gate 17 and they were\n\njust lifting the thick white\n\n(40) lozenge of the door to fit it into\n\nthe socket of the plane. Like the one who is not\n\ntoo rich, I turned sideways and\n\nslipped through the needle’s eye,1 and then\n\nI walked down the aisle toward my father. The jet\n\n(45) was full, and people’s hair was shining, they were\n\nsmiling, the interior of the plane was filled with a\n\nmist of gold endorphin2 light,\n\nI wept as people weep when they enter heaven,\n\nin massive relief. We lifted up\n\n(50) gently from one tip of the continent\n\nand did not stop until we set down lightly on the\n\nother edge. I walked into his room\n\nand watched his chest rise slowly\n\nand sink again, all night\n\n(55) I watched him breathe.\n\n“The Race” from The Father by Sharon Olds, copyright © 1992 by Sharon Olds.
