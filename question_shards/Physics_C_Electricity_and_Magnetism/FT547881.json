    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nRemembrance\n\nCold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee,\n\nFar, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!\n\nHave I forgot, my only Love, to love thee,\n\nSevered at last by Time’s all-severing wave?\n\n(5)   Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover\n\nOver the mountains, on that northern shore,\n\nResting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover\n\nThy noble heart for ever, ever more?\n\nCold in the earth—and fifteen wild Decembers,\n\n(10)   From those brown hills, have melted into spring:\n\nFaithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers\n\nAfter such years of change and suffering!\n\nSweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee,\n\nWhile the world’s tide is bearing me along;\n\n(15)   Other desires and other hopes beset me,\n\nHopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong!\n\nNo later light has lightened up my heaven,\n\nNo second morn has ever shone for me;\n\nAll my life’s bliss from thy dear life was given,\n\n(20)   All my life’s bliss is in the grave with thee.\n\nBut, when the days of golden dreams had perished,\n\nAnd even Despair was powerless to destroy;\n\nThen did I learn how existence could be cherished,\n\nStrengthened and fed without the aid of joy.\n\n(25)   Then did I check the tears of useless passion—\n\nWeaned my young soul from yearning after thine;\n\nSternly denied its burning wish to hasten\n\nDown to that tomb already more than mine.\n\nAnd, even yet, I dare not let it languish,\n\n(30)   Dare not indulge in memory’s rapturous pain;\n\nOnce drinking deep of that divinest anguish,\n\nHow could I seek the empty world again?\n\n(1846)",
