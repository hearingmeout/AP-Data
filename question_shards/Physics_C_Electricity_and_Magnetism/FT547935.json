    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe Frog in the Swimming Pool\n\nA wet green velvet scums the swimming pool,\n\nfurring the cracks. The deep end swims\n\nin a hatful of rain, not enough to float\n\nthe bedspring barge, the tug of shopping cart.\n\n(5)   Green-wet himself, the bullfrog holds his court,\n\nsounding the summons to a life so low\n\nhe’s yet to lure a mate. Under the lip\n\nof concrete slab he reigns, a rumble of rock,\n\na flickering of sticky tongue that’s licked\n\n(10)   at any morsel winging into view.\n\nHow would he love her? Let me count the waves*\n\nthat scrape the underside of night and then\n\nlet go, the depth of love unplumbed, the breadth,\n\nthe height of the pool all he needs to know.\n\n(15)   How do I love him? Let me add the weight\n\nof one hush to another, the mockingbird\n\nat midnight echoing itself, not him,\n\none silence torn in two, sewn shut again.\n\nDown to his level in time wings everything.\n\n(20)   He calls the night down on his unlovely head,\n\non the slimy skin that breathes the slimy air—\n\nthe skin that’s shed and still he is the same,\n\nthe first voice in the world, the last each night.\n\nHis call has failed to fill the empty house\n\n(25)   across the street, the vacant swing that sways\n\nhalfheartedly, the slide slid into rust,\n\nthe old griefs waiting burial by the new.\n\n* Lines 11-14 allude to the Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) sonnet that begins, “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.”\n\nFrom Off-Season at the Edge of the World. Copyright 1994 by Debora Greger. Used with permission of the poet and the University of Illinois Press.",
