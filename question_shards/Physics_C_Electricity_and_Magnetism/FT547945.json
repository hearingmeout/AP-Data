    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nPatty’s Charcoal Drive-in\n\nFirst job. In tight black shorts\n\nand a white bowling shirt, red lipstick\n\nand bouncing pony tail, I present\n\neach overflowing tray as if it were a banquet.\n\n(5)   I’m sixteen and college-bound,\n\nthis job’s temporary as the summer sun,\n\nbut right now, it’s the boundaries of my life.\n\nAfter the first few nights of mixed orders\n\nand missing cars, the work goes easily.\n\n(10)   I take out the silver trays and hook them to the windows,\n\ninhale the mingled smells of seared meat patties,\n\nsalty ketchup, rich sweet malteds.\n\nThe lure of grease drifts through the thick night air.\n\nAnd it’s always summer at Patty’s Charcoal Drive-In—\n\n(15)   carloads of blonde-and-tan girls\n\npull up next to red convertibles,\n\nboys in black tee shirts and slick hair.\n\nEveryone knows what they want.\n\nAnd I wait on them, hoping for tips,\n\n(20)   loose pieces of silver\n\nflung carelessly as the stars.\n\nDoo-wop music streams from the jukebox\n\nand each night repeats itself,\n\nfaithful as a steady date.\n\n(25)   Towards 10 P.M., traffic dwindles.\n\nWe police the lot, pick up wrappers.\n\nThe dark pours down, sticky as Coke,\n\nbut the light from the kitchen\n\ngleams like a beacon.\n\n(30)   A breeze comes up, chasing papers\n\nin the far corners of the darkened lot,\n\nas if suddenly a cold wind had started to blow\n\nstraight at me from the future—\n\nI read that in a Doris Lessing book—\n\n(35)   but right now, purse fat with tips,\n\nthe moon sitting like a cheeseburger on a flat black grill,\n\nthis is enough.\n\nYour order please.",
