    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe Imaginary Iceberg\n\n(1)   We’d rather have the iceberg than the ship,\n\nalthough it meant the end of travel.\n\nAlthough it stood stock-still like cloudy rock\n\nand all the sea were moving marble.\n\n(5)     We’d rather have the iceberg than the ship;\n\nwe’d rather own this breathing plain of snow\n\nthough the ship’s sails were laid upon the sea\n\nas the snow lies undissolved upon the water.\n\nO solemn, floating field,\n\n(10)     are you aware an iceberg takes repose\n\nwith you, and when it wakes may pasture on your snows?\n\nThis is a scene a sailor’d give his eyes for.\n\nThe ship’s ignored. The iceberg rises\n\nand sinks again; its glassy pinnacles\n\n(15)   correct elliptics in the sky.\n\nThis is a scene where he who treads the boards\n\nis artlessly rhetorical. The curtain\n\nis light enough to rise on finest ropes\n\nthat airy twists of snow provide.\n\n(20)    The wits of these white peaks\n\nspar with the sun. Its weight the iceberg dares\n\nupon a shifting stage and stands and stares.\n\nThis iceberg cuts its facets from within.\n\nLike jewelry from a grave\n\n(25)   it saves itself perpetually and adorns\n\nonly itself, perhaps the snows\n\nwhich so surprise us lying on the sea.\n\nGood-bye, we say, good-bye, the ship steers off\n\nwhere waves give in to one another’s waves\n\n(30)   and clouds run in a warmer sky.\n\nIcebergs behoove the soul\n\n(Both being self-made from elements least visible)\n\nto see them so: fleshed, fair, erected indivisible.\n\n“The Imaginary Iceberg” from THE COMPLETE POEMS 1927-1979 by Elizabeth Bishop.
