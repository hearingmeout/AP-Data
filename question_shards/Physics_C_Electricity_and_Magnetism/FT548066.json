    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nTo an Inconstant One\n\nI loved thee once; I’ll love no more —\n\nThine be the grief as is the blame;\n\nThou art not what thou wast before,\n\nWhat reason I should be the same?\n\n(5)        He that can love unloved again,\n\nHath better store of love than brain:\n\nGod send me love my debts to pay,\n\nWhile unthrifts fool their love away!\n\nNothing could have my love o’erthrown\n\n(10)    If thou hadst still continued mine;\n\nYea, if thou hadst remained thy own,\n\nI might perchance have yet been thine.\n\nBut thou thy freedom didst recall\n\nThat it thou might elsewhere enthral:\n\n(15)    And then how could I but disdain\n\nA captive’s captive to remain?\n\nWhen new desires had conquered thee\n\nAnd changed the object of thy will,\n\nIt had been lethargy in me,\n\n(20)    Not constancy, to love thee still.\n\nYea, it had been a sin to go\n\nAnd prostitute affection so:\n\nSince we are taught no prayers to say\n\nTo such as must to others pray.\n\n(25) Yet do thou glory in thy choice—\n\nThy choice of his good fortune boast;\n\nI’ll neither grieve nor yet rejoice\n\nTo see him gain what I have lost:\n\nThe height of my disdain shall be\n\n(30)        To laugh at him, to blush for thee;\n\nTo love thee still, but go no more\n\nA-begging at a beggar’s door.",
