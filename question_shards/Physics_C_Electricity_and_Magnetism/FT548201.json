    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nTime was, a sober Englishman wou’d knock\n\nHis servants up, and rise by five a clock,\n\nInstruct his Family in ev'ry rule,\n\nAnd send his Wife to Church, his Son to school.\n\n(5)    To worship like his Fathers was his care;\n\nTo teach their frugal Virtues to his Heir;\n\nTo prove, that Luxury could never hold;\n\nAnd place, on good Security, his Gold.\n\nNow Times are chang'd, and one Poetick Itch\n\n(10)    Has seiz'd the Court and City, Poor and Rich:\n\nSons, Sires, and Grandsires, all will wear the Bays,\n\nOur Wives read Milton, and our Daughters Plays,\n\nTo Theatres, and to Rehearsals throng,\n\nAnd all our Grace at Table is a Song.\n\n(15)    I, who so oft renounce the Muses, lye,\n\nNot—'s self e'er tells more Fibs than I;\n\nWhen, sick of Muse, our follies we deplore,\n\nAnd promise our best Friends to ryme no more;\n\nWe wake next morning in a raging Fit,\n\n(20)    And call for Pen and Ink to show our Wit.\n\nHe serv'd a ’Prenticeship, who sets up shop;\n\nWard try'd on Puppies, and the Poor, his Drop;\n\nEv’n Radcliff’s Doctors travel first to France,\n\nNor dare to practise till they’ve learn'd to dance.\n\n(25)    Who builds a Bridge that never drove a pyle?\n\n(Should Ripley venture, all the World would smile)\n\nBut those who cannot write, and those who can,\n\nAll ryme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man.\n\nYet Sir, reflect, the mischief is not great;\n\n(30)    These Madmen never hurt the Church or State:\n\nSometimes the Folly benefits mankind;\n\nAnd rarely Av’rice taints the tuneful mind.\n\nAllow him but his Play-thing of a Pen,\n\nHe ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men:\n\n(35)    Flight of Cashiers, or Mobs, he'll never mind;\n\nAnd knows no losses while the Muse is kind.\n\nTo cheat a Friend, or Ward, he leaves to Peter;\n\nThe good man heaps up nothing but mere metre,\n\nEnjoys his Garden and his Book in quiet;\n\n(40)    And then—a perfect Hermit in his Diet.\n\nOf little use the Man you may suppose,\n\nWho says in verse what others say in prose;\n\nYet let me show, a Poet's of some weight,\n\nAnd (tho’ no Soldier) useful to the State.\n\n(45)    What will a Child learn sooner than a song?\n\nWhat better teach a Foreigner the tongue?\n\nWhat's long or short, each accent where to place,\n\nAnd speak in publick with some sort of grace.\n\nI scarce can think him such a worthless thing,\n\n(50)    Unless he praise some monster of a King,\n\nOr Virtue, or Religion turn to sport,\n\nTo please a lewd, or un-believing Court.",
