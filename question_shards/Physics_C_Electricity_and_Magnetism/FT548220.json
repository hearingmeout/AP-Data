    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe Eolian Harp*\n\nMy pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined\n\nThus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is\n\nTo sit beside our Cot, our Cot o'ergrown\n\nWith white-flower'd Jasmin, and the broad-leav'd Myrtle,\n\n(5)       Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!)\n\nAnd watch the clouds, that late were rich with light,\n\nSlow saddening round, and mark the star of eve\n\nSerenely brilliant (such should Wisdom be)\n\nShine opposite! How exquisite the scents\n\n(10)     Snatch'd from yon bean-field! and the world so hush'd!\n\nThe stilly murmur of the distant Sea\n\nTells us of silence.\n\nAnd that simplest Lute,\n\nPlaced length-ways in the clasping casement, hark!\n\nHow by the desultory breeze caress'd,\n\n(15)     Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover,\n\nIt pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs\n\nTempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings\n\nBoldlier swept, the long sequacious notes\n\nOver delicious surges sink and rise,\n\n(20)     Such a soft floating witchery of sound\n\nAs twilight Elfins make, when they at eve\n\nVoyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land,\n\nWhere Melodies round honey-dropping flowers,\n\nFootless and wild, like birds of Paradise,\n\n(25)     Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untam'd wing!\n\nO! the one Life within us and abroad,\n\nWhich meets all motion and becomes its soul,\n\nA light in sound, a sound-like power in light,\n\nRhythm in all thought, and joyance every where—\n\n(30)     Methinks, it should have been impossible\n\nNot to love all things in a world so fill'd;\n\nWhere the breeze warbles, and the mute still air\n\nIs Music slumbering on her instrument.\n\nAnd thus, my Love! as on the midway slope\n\n(35)     Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon,\n\nWhilst through my half-clos'd eye-lids I behold\n\nThe sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main,\n\nAnd tranquil muse upon tranquility;\n\nFull many a thought uncall'd and undetain'd,\n\n(40)     And many idle flitting phantasies,\n\nTraverse my indolent and passive brain,\n\nAs wild and various as the random gales\n\nThat swell and flutter on this subject Lute!\n\nAnd what if all of animated nature\n\n(45)     Be but organic Harps diversely fram'd,\n\nThat tremble into thought, as o’er them sweeps\n\nPlastic and vast, one intellectual breeze,\n\nAt once the Soul of each, and God of all?\n\nBut thy more serious eye a mild reproof\n\n(50)     Darts, O belovéd Woman! nor such thoughts\n\nDim and unhallow'd dost thou not reject,\n\nAnd biddest me walk humbly with my God.\n\nMeek Daughter in the family of Christ!\n\nWell hast thou said and holily disprais'd\n\n(55)     These shapings of the unregenerate mind;\n\nBubbles that glitter as they rise and break\n\nOn vain Philosophy's aye-babbling spring.\n\nFor never guiltless may I speak of him,\n\nThe Incomprehensible! save when with awe\n\n(60)     I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels;\n\nWho with his saving mercies healéd me,\n\nA sinful and most miserable man,\n\nWilder'd and dark, and gave me to possess\n\nPeace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honour'd Maid!\n\n*A box with strings across its open ends that makes music as the breeze passes through it",
