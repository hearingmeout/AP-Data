    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nHere, take my likeness with you, whilst 'tis so;\n\nFor when from hence you go,\n\nThe next sun's rising will behold\n\nMe pale, and lean, and old.\n\n(5)     The man who did this picture draw\n\nWill swear next day my face he never saw.\n\nI really believe, within a while,\n\nIf you upon this shadow smile,\n\nYour presence will such vigour give,\n\n(10)    (Your presence which makes all things live)\n\nAnd absence so much alter me,\n\nThis will the substance, I the shadow be.\n\nWhen from your well-wrought cabinet you take it,\n\nAnd your bright looks awake it;\n\n(15)    Ah, be not frighted, if you see,\n\nThe new-soul’d picture gaze on thee,\n\nAnd hear it breathe a sigh or two;\n\nFor those are the first things that it will do.\n\nMy rival-image will be then thought blest,\n\n(20)    And laugh at me as dispossesed;\n\nBut, thou, who (if I know thee right)\n\nI’th’ substance does not much delight,\n\nWilt rather send again for me,\n\nWho then shall but my picture's picture be.\n\n—Abraham Cowley",
