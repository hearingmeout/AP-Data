    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nA Whippoorwill in the Woods\n\nNight after night, it was very nearly enough,\n\nthey said, to drive you crazy: a whippoorwill\n\nin the woods repeating itself like the stuck groove\n\nof an LP with a defect, and no way possible\n\n(5)               of turning the thing off.\n\nAnd night after night, they said, in the insomniac\n\nsmall hours the whipsawing voice of obsession\n\nwould have come in closer, the way a sick\n\nthing does when it's done for—or maybe the reason\n\n(10)             was nothing more melodramatic\n\nthan a night-flying congregation of moths, lured in\n\nin their turn by house-glow, the strange heat\n\nof it—imagine the nebular dangerousness, if one\n\nwere a moth, the dark pockmarked with beaks, the great\n\n(15)              dim shapes, the bright extinction—\n\nif moths are indeed, after all, what a whippoorwill\n\nfavors. Who knows? Anyhow, from one point of view\n\ninsects are to be seen as an ailment, moths above all:\n\nthe filmed-over, innumerable nodes of spun-out tissue\n\n(20)    untidying the trees, the larval\n\nspew of such hairy hordes, one wonders what use\n\nthey can be other than as a guarantee no bird\n\ngoes hungry. We're like that. The webbiness,\n\nthe gregariousness of the many are what we can't abide.\n\n(25)           We single out for notice\n\nabove all what's disjunct, the way birds are,\n\nwith their unhooked-up, cheekily anarchic\n\ndartings and flashings,their uncalled-for color—\n\nthe indelible look of the rose-breasted grosbeak\n\n(30)           an aunt of mine, a noticer\n\nof such things before the noticing had or needed\n\na name, drew my five-year-old attention up to, in\n\nthe green deeps of a maple. She never married,\n\nbelieved her cat had learned to leave birds alone,\n\n(35)           and for years, node after node,\n\nby lingering degrees she made way within for\n\nwhat wasn't so much a thing as it was a system,\n\na webwork of error that throve until it killed her.\n\nWhat is health? We must all die sometime.\n\n(40)           Whatever it is out there\n\nin the woods, that begins to seem like\n\na species of madness, we survive as we can:\n\nthe hooked-up, the humdrum, the brief, tragic\n\nwonder of being at all. The whippoorwill out in\n\n(45)          the woods, for me, brought back\n\nas by a relay, from a place at such a distance\n\nno recollection now in place could reach so far,\n\nthe memory of a memory she told me of once:\n\nof how her father, my grandfather, by whatever\n\n(50)        now unfathomable happenstance,\n\ncarried her (she might have been five) into the breathing night.\n\n\"Listen!\" she said he'd said. “Did you hear it?\n\nThat was a whippoorwill.” And she (and I) never forgot.\n\nFrom Westward by Amy Clampitt. \n\nCopyright © 1990 by Any Clampitt. \n\nReprinted by permission of Alfred A.
