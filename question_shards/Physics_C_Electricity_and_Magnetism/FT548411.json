    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nI dreaded that first Robin, so,\n\nBut He is mastered, now,\n\nI'm some accustomed to Him grown,\n\nHe hurts a little, though—\n\n(5) I thought if I could only live\n\nTill that first Shout got by—\n\nNot all Pianos in the Woods\n\nHad power to mangle me—\n\nI dared not meet the Daffodils—\n\n(10) For fear their Yellow Gown\n\nWould pierce me with a fashion\n\nSo foreign to my own—\n\nI wished the Grass would hurry—\n\nSo—when 'twas time to see—\n\n(15) He’d be so tall, the tallest one\n\nCould stretch—to look at me—\n\nI could not bear the Bees should come,\n\nI wished they'd stay away\n\nIn those dim countries where they go,\n\n(20) What word had they, for me?\n\nThey're here, though; not a creature failed—\n\nNo Blossom stayed away\n\nIn gentle deference to me—\n\nThe Queen of Calvary—\n\n(25) Each one salutes me, as he goes,\n\nAnd I, my childish Plumes\n\nLift, in bereaved acknowledgment\n\nOf their unthinking Drums—\n\n—Emily Dickinson\n\n(c. 1862)\n\nReprinted by permission of the publishers and the Trustees of Amherst College from The Poems of Emily Dickinson, Thomas H.
