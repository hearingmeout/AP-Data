    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\n[Enter VOLPONE and MOSCA]\n\nVOLPONE:\n\nGood morning to the day; and next, my gold.\n\nOpen the shrine that I may see my saint.\n\nHail the world's soul, and mine. More glad than is\n\nThe teeming earth to see the longed-for sun\n\n(5)     Peep through the horns of the celestial Ram,\n\nAm I, to view thy splendor darkening his;\n\nThat, lying here, amongst my other hoards,\n\nShowest like a flame by night, or like the day\n\nStruck out of chaos when all darkness fled\n\n(10)     Unto the center. O thou Son of Sol*\n\nBut brighter than thy father, let me kiss,\n\nWith adoration, thee, and every relic\n\nOf sacred treasure in this blessèd room.\n\nWell did wise poets, by thy glorious name,\n\n(15)     Title that age which they would have the best;\n\nThou being the best of things, and far transcending\n\nAll style of joy, in children, parents, friends,\n\nOr any other waking dream on earth.\n\nThy looks when they to Venus did ascribe,\n\n(20)     They should have given her twenty thousand Cupids;\n\nSuch are thy beauties and our loves! Dear saint,\n\nRiches, the dumb god, that giv’st all men tongues,\n\nThat canst do nought, and yet makest men do all things;\n\nThe price of souls; even hell, with thee to boot,\n\n(25)     Is made worth heaven. Thou art virtue, fame,\n\nHonor and all things else! Who can get thee,\n\nHe shall be noble, valiant, honest, wise—\n\nMOSCA:\n\nAnd what he will, sir. Riches are a fortune\n\nA greater good than wisdom is in nature.\n\n(1606)\n\n(1681)\n\n*Sol: the sun",
