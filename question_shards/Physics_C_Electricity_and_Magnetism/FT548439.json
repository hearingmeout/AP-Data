    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe speaker in this poem is visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The monument, inscribed with the names of the Americans who died or disappeared in the Vietnam War, consists of two 250-foot-long black granite walls converging in a \"V.”\n\nFacing It\n\nMy black face fades,\n\nhiding inside the black granite.\n\nI said I wouldn't,\n\ndammit: No tears.\n\n(5)   I'm stone. I'm flesh.\n\nMy clouded reflection eyes me\n\nlike a bird of prey, the profile of night\n\nslanted against morning. I turn\n\nthis way—the stone lets me go.\n\n(10)   I turn that way—I’m inside\n\nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial\n\nagain, depending on the light\n\nto make a difference.\n\nI go down the 58,022 names,\n\n(15)    half-expecting to find\n\nmy own in letters like smoke.\n\nI touch the name Andrew Johnson;\n\nI see the booby trap's white flash.\n\nNames shimmer on a woman’s blouse\n\n(20)   but when she walks away\n\nthe names stay on the wall.\n\nBrushstrokes flash, a red bird's\n\nwings cutting across my stare.\n\nThe sky. A plane in the sky.\n\n(25)   A white vet's image floats\n\ncloser to me, then his pale eyes\n\nlook through mine. I'm a window.\n\nHe’s lost his right arm\n\ninside the stone. In the black mirror\n\n(30)   a woman's trying to erase names:\n\nNo, she's brushing a boy's hair.\n\nYusef Komunyakaa “Facing It\" from Dien Cai Dau © 1988 by Yusef Komunyakaa, \n\nWesleyan University Press by permission of University Press of New England.",
