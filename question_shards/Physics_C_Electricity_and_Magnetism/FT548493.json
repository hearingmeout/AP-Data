    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\nThe old books, Virgil, Euclid, and Aldrich—that wrinkled fruit of the tree of knowledge—had been all laid by, for Maggie had turned her back on the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise. In her first ardour she flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she had risen above the need of them, and if they had been her own, she would have burned them, believing that she would never repent. She read so eagerly and constantly in her three books, the Bible, Thomas à Kempis,* and the Christian Year (no longer rejected as a \"hymn-book”), that they filled her mind with a continual stream of rhythmic memories; and she was too ardently learning to see all nature and life in the light of her new faith to need any other material for her mind to work on as she sat with her well-plied needle making shirts and other complicated stitchings, falsely called \"plain”—by no means plain to Maggie, since wristband and sleeve and the like had a capability of being sewed in wrong side outwards in moments of mental wandering.\nHanging diligently over her sewing, Maggie was a sight anyone might have been pleased to look at. That new inward life of hers, notwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions, yet shone out in her face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as added loveliness with the gradually enriched colour and outline of her blossoming youth. Her mother felt the change in her with a sort of puzzled wonder that Maggie should be \"growing up so good”; it was amazing that this once “contrairy” child was become so submissive, so backward to assert her own will. Maggie used to look up from her work and find her mother's eyes fixed upon her; they were watching and waiting for the large young glance as if her elder frame got some needful warmth from it. The mother was getting fond of her tall, brown girl, the only bit of furniture now on which she could bestow her anxiety and pride; and Maggie, in spite of her own ascetic wish to have no personal adornment, was obliged to give way to her mother about her hair and submit to have the abundant black locks plaited into a coronet on the summit of her head after the pitiable fashion of those antiquated times.\n\"Let your mother have that bit o' pleasure, my dear,” said Mrs. Tulliver; \"I'd trouble enough with your hair once.”\nSo Maggie, glad of anything that would soothe her mother and cheer their long day together, consented to the vain decoration and showed a queenly head above her old frocks, steadily refusing, however, to look at herself in the glass. Mrs. Tulliver liked to call the father's attention to Maggie's hair and other unexpected virtues, but he had a brusque reply to give.\n\"I knew well enough what she'd be, before now; it's nothing new to me. But it's a pity she isn't made o' commoner stuff; she'll be thrown away, I doubt; there'll be nobody to marry her as is fit for her.”\nAnd Maggie's graces of mind and body fed his gloom. He sat patiently enough while she read him a chapter or said something timidly when they were alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing. He took it all as a part of his daughter's goodness, which made his misfortunes the sadder to him because they damaged her chance in life. In a mind charged with an eager purpose and an unsatisfied vindictiveness, there is no room for new feelings; Mr. Tulliver did not want spiritual consolation, he wanted to shake off the degradation of debt and to have his revenge.\n\n*Thomas à Kempis (1380–1471) was a Christian cleric, author of Imitation of Christ.",
