    "description": "A factory has two machines, A and B, making the same part for refrigerators. The number of defective parts produced by each machine during the first hour of operation was recorded on 19 randomly selected days. The scatterplot below shows the number of defective parts produced by each machine on the selected days.",
    "question": "Which statement gives the best comparison between the number of defective parts produced by the machines during the first hour of operation on the 19 days?",
