    "description": "A state educational agency was concerned that the salaries of public school teachers in one region of the state,region A, were higher than the salaries in another region of the state, region B. The agency took two independent random samples of salaries of public school teachers, one from region A and one from region B. The data are summarized in the table below.",
    "question": "Assuming all conditions for inference are met, do the data provide convincing statistical evidence that the salaries of public school teachers in region A are, on average, greater than the salaries of public school teachers in region B?",
