    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe Albuquerque Graveyard\n\nIt would be easier\n\nto bury our dead\n\nat the corner lot.\n\nNo need to wake\n\n(5)     before sunrise,\n\ntake three buses,\n\nwalk two blocks,\n\nsearch at the rear\n\nof the cemetery,\n\n(10)   to come upon the familiar names\n\nwith wilted flowers and patience.\n\nBut now I am here again.\n\nAfter so many years\n\nof coming here,\n\n(15)   passing the sealed mausoleums,\n\nthe pretentious brooks and springs,\n\nthe white, sturdy limestone crosses,\n\nthe pattern of the place is clear to me.\n\nI am going back\n\n(20)   to the Black limbo,\n\nan unwritten history\n\nof our own tensions.\n\nThe dead lie here\n\nin a hierarchy of small defeats.\n\n(25)   I can almost see the leaders smile,\n\nashamed now of standing\n\nat the head of those\n\nwho lie tangled\n\nat the edge of the cemetery\n\n(30)   still ready to curse and rage\n\nas I do.\n\nHere, I stop by the imitative cross\n\nof one who stocked his parlor\n\nwith pictures of Robeson,*\n\n(35)   and would boom down the days,\n\ndreaming of Othello's robes.\n\nI say he never bothered me,\n\nand forgive his frightened singing.\n\nHere, I stop by the simple mound\n\n(40)   of a woman who taught me\n\nspelling on the sly,\n\nparsing my tongue\n\nto make me fit for her own dreams.\n\nI could go on all day,\n\n(45)   unhappily recognizing small heroes,\n\ndiscontent with finding them here,\n\nreproaches to my own failings.\n\nUneasy, I search the names\n\nand simple mounds I call my own,\n\n(50)   abruptly drop my wilted flowers,\n\nand turn for home.\n\nFrom The Selected Poems of Jay Wright, copyright © 1987 by Jay Wright, published by Princeton University Press.
