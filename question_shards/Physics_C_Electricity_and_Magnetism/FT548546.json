    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe following sonnet, published in 1609, is addressed to a friend of the speaker.\n\nThen hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,\n\nNow, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\n\nJoin with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\n\nAnd do not drop in for an after-loss.\n\n(5) Ah, do not, when my heart has ’scaped this sorrow,\n\nCome in the rearward of a conquered woe;\n\nGive not a windy night a rainy morrow,\n\nTo linger out a purposed overthrow.\n\nIf thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\n\n(10) When other petty griefs have done their spite;\n\nBut in the onset come, so shall I taste\n\nAt first the very worst of fortune's might;\n\nAnd other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\n\nCompared with loss of thee, will not seem so.",
