    "question": "At a large airport, data were recorded for one month on how many baggage items were unloaded from each flight upon arrival as well as the time required to deliver all the baggage items on the flight to the baggage claim area. A scatterplot of the two variables indicated a strong, positive linear association between the variables. Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the word “strong” in the description of the association?",

      {
