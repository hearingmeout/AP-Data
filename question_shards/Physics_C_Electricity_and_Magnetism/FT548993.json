    "question": "An isolated conducting sphere of radius a = 0.20 m is at a potential of –2,000 V.\n\n(a) Determine the charge 𝑄0 on the sphere.\n\nThe charged sphere is then concentrically surrounded by two uncharged conducting hemispheres of inner radius b = 0.40 m and outer radius c = 0.50 m, which are joined together as shown above, forming a spherical capacitor. A wire is connected from the outer sphere to ground, and then removed.\n\n(b) Determine the magnitude of the electric field in the following regions as a function of the distance r from the center of the inner sphere.\n\nr < a\n\na < r < b\n\nb < r < c\n\nr < c\n\n(c) Determine the magnitude of the potential difference between the sphere and the conducting shell.\n\n(d) Determine the capacitance of the spherical capacitor.",
