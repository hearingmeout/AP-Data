    "question": "An isolated conducting sphere of radius a = 0.20 m is at a potential of –2,000 V. (a) Determine the charge 𝑄0 on the sphere. The charged sphere is then concentrically surrounded by two uncharged conducting hemispheres of inner radius b = 0.40 m and outer radius c = 0.50 m, which are joined together as shown above, forming a spherical capacitor. A wire is connected from the outer sphere to ground, and then removed. (b) Determine the magnitude of the electric field in the following regions as a function of the distance r from the center of the inner sphere. r < a a < r < b b < r < c r < c (c) Determine the magnitude of the potential difference between the sphere and the conducting shell. (d) Determine the capacitance of the spherical capacitor.",
