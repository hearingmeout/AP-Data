    "question": "Lightbulb A, B, and C are connected in the circuit shown above. (a) List the bulbs in order of their brightness, from brightest to least bright. If any bulbs have the same brightness, state which ones. Justify your answer. Now a switch S and a 5.0 mH inductor are added to the circuit, as shown above. The switch is closed at time t = 0. (b) Determine the currents IA, IB, and IC for the following times. Immediately after the switch is closed A long time after the switch is closed (c) On the axes below, sketch the magnitude of the potential difference VL across the inductor as a function of time, from immediately after the switch is closed until a long time after the switch is closed. (d) Now consider a similar circuit with an uncharged 5.0 μF capacitor instead of the inductor, as shown above. The switch is again closed at time t = 0. On the axes below, sketch the magnitude of the potential difference Vcap across the capacitor as a function of time, from immediately after the switch is closed until a long time after the switch is closed.",
