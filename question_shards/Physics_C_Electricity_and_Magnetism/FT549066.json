    "question": "A capacitor consists of two conducting, coaxial, cylindrical shells of radius a and b, respectively, and length L > > b. The space between the cylinders is filled with oil that has a dielectric constant 𝜅 . Initially both cylinders are uncharged, but then a battery is used to charge the capacitor, leaving a charge +𝑄 on the inner cylinder and –𝑄 on the outer cylinder, as shown above. Let r be the radial distance from the axis of the capacitor.
