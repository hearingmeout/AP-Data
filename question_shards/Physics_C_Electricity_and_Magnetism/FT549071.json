    "question": "A rod of uniform linear charge density 𝜆 = +1.5 × 10–5 C/m is bent into an arc of radius R = 0.10 m. The arc is placed with its center at the origin of the axes shown above.\n\nDetermine the total charge on the rod.\n\nDetermine the magnitude and direction of the electric field at the center O of the arc.\n\nDetermine the electric potential at point O.\n\nA proton is now placed at point O and held in place. Ignore the effects of gravity in the rest of this problem.\n\nDetermine the magnitude and direction of the force that must be applied in order to keep the proton at rest.\n\nThe proton is now released. Describe in words its motion for a long time after its release.",
