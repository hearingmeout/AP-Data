    "question": "A rod of uniform linear charge density 𝜆 = +1.5 × 10–5 C/m is bent into an arc of radius R = 0.10 m. The arc is placed with its center at the origin of the axes shown above. Determine the total charge on the rod. Determine the magnitude and direction of the electric field at the center O of the arc. Determine the electric potential at point O. A proton is now placed at point O and held in place. Ignore the effects of gravity in the rest of this problem. Determine the magnitude and direction of the force that must be applied in order to keep the proton at rest. The proton is now released. Describe in words its motion for a long time after its release.",
