    "question": "Your engineering firm has built the RC circuit shown above.

You may add resistors or capacitors to the original components and reconnect the RC circuit. In parts i and ii below, show how to reconnect the circuit, using either an additional resistor or a capacitor to decrease the charging time.\n\nIndicate how a resistor may be added to decrease the charging time. Add the necessary resistor and connections to the following diagram.\n\nInstead of a resistor, use a capacitor. Indicate how the capacitor may be added to decrease the charging time. Add the necessary capacitor and connections to the following diagram.",
