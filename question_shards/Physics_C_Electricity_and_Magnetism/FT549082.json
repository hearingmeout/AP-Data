    "question": "In the laboratory, you connect a resistor and a capacitor with unknown values in series with a battery of emf ℇ = 12 V . You include a switch in the circuit. When the switch is closed at time t = 0, the circuit is completed, and you measure the current through the resistor as a function of time as plotted below.

You are now asked to reconnect the circuit with a new switch in such a way as to charge and discharge the capacitor.

Draw a schematic diagram of the RC circuit that you constructed that would produce the graph above. Clearly indicate switch positions A and B on your circuit diagram and include whatever other devices you need to measure the voltage across the capacitor to obtain the above plot.
