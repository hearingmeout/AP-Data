    "question": "An airplane has an aluminum antenna attached to its wing that extends 15 m from wingtip to wingtip. The plane is traveling north at 75 m/s in a region where Earth’s magnetic field has both a vertical component and a northward component, as shown above. The net magnetic field is at an angle of 55 degrees from horizontal and has a magnitude of 6.0 × 10–5 T.\n\nOn the figure below, indicate the direction of the magnetic force on electrons in the antenna. Justify your answer.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the electric field generated in the antenna.\n\nDetermine the potential difference between the ends of the antenna.\n\nOn the figure below, indicate which end of the antenna is at higher potential.\n\nThe ends of the antenna are now connected by a conducting wire so that a closed circuit is formed.\n\nDescribe the condition(s) that would be necessary for a current to be induced in the circuit. Give a specific example of how the condition(s) could be created.\n\nFor the example you gave in i. above, indicate the direction of the current in the antenna on the figure below.",
