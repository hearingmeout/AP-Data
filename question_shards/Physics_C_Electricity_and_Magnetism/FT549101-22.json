    "description": "A symbol is an object, action, or event that represents something or that creates a range of associations beyond itself. In literary works a symbol can express an idea, clarify meaning, or enlarge literal meaning.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list, choose a work of fiction in which a symbol reveals something complex about the characters or themes within the work. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze what complex idea or meaning the symbol reveals and how it contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nAs I Lay Dying\n\nThe Awakening\n\nBeloved\n\nBleak House\n\nCat’s Eye\n\nThe Cherry Orchard\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nThe Crossing\n\nThe Crucible\n\nA Doll House\n\nEquus\n\nA Farewell to Arms\n\nFences\n\nThe Glass Menagerie\n\nThe Golden Bowl\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nThe Hairy Ape\n\nHeart of Darkness\n\nInvisible Man\n\nJude the Obscure\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nLady Windermere’s Fan\n\nMacbeth\n\nMadame Bovary\n\nThe Memory Keeper’s Daughter\n\nMoby-Dick\n\nThe Namesake\n\nNineteen Eighty-four\n\nOur Town\n\nThe Plague\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\n\nA Prayer for Owen Meany\n\nA Raisin in the Sun\n\nReservation Blues\n\nSnow\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nWaiting for Godot\n\nWise Blood\n\nThe Women of Brewster Place",
