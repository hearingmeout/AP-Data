    "description": "In Sir Philip Sidney’s poem “Thou Blind Man’s Mark,” published circa 1586, the speaker addresses the subject of desire. Read the poem carefully.  Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Sidney uses literary elements and techniques to convey the speaker’s complex attitude toward desire. In your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThou Blind Man’s Mark\n\nThou blind man’s mark,1 thou fool’s self-chosen snare,\n\nFond fancy’s scum, and dregs of scattered thought;\n\nBand of all evils, cradle of causeless care;\n\nThou web of will, whose end is never wrought;\n\n(5)Desire, desire! I have too dearly bought,\n\nWith price of mangled mind, thy worthless ware;\n\nToo long, too long, asleep thou hast me brought,\n\nWho should my mind to higher things prepare.\n\nBut yet in vain thou hast my ruin sought;\n\n(10)In vain thou madest me to vain things aspire;\n\nIn vain thou kindlest all thy smoky fire;\n\nFor virtue hath this better lesson taught—\n\nWithin myself to seek my only hire,2\n\nDesiring naught but how to kill desire.\n\n1harvest\n\n2reward",
