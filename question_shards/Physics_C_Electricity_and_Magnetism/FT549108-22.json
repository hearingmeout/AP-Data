    "description": "In John Updike’s poem “Marching Through a Novel,” published in 1993, the speaker discusses character development in the process of writing a novel. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Updike uses literary elements and techniques to convey the complex relationship between the novelist and the characters in the novel.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nMarching Through a Novel\n\nEach morning my characters\n\ngreet me with misty faces\n\nwilling, though chilled, to muster\n\nfor another day’s progress\n\n(5)   through the dazzling quicksand\n\nthe marsh of blank paper\n\nWith instant obedience\n\nthey change clothes and mannerisms\n\ndrop a speech impediment\n\n(10)         develop a motive backwards\n\nto suit the deed that’s done\n\nThey extend skeletal arms\n\nfor the handcuffs of contrivance,\n\nslog through docilely\n\n(15)   maneuvers of coincidence,\n\nlook toward me hopefully,\n\ntheir general and quartermaster,\n\nfor a clearer face, a bigger heart.\n\nI do what I can for them\n\n(20)         but it is not enough\n\nForward is my order\n\nthough their bandages unravel\n\nand some have no backbones\n\nand some turn traitor\n\n(25)   like heads with two faces\n\nand some fall forgotten\n\nin the trenchwork of loose threads\n\npoor puffs of cartoon flak.\n\nForward. Believe me, I love them\n\n(30)         though I march them to finish them off.\n\n“Marching Through a Novel,” from Collected Poems 1953-1993 by John Updike, copyright © 1993 by John Updike.
