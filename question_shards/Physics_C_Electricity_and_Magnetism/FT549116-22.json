    "description": "In The Defence of Poesy (1595), Sir Philip Sidney asserts that the purpose of imaginative literature is “to teach and delight.” He writes that “the poet” may sugarcoat a serious message:\n\n“[H]e cometh unto you, with a tale which holdeth children from play, and old men from the chimney corner. And, pretending no more, doth intend the winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue—even as the child is often brought to take most wholesome things by hiding them in such other as have a pleasant taste. . . .”\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list, choose a work of fiction which seems intended both “to teach and delight.” Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the complex pursuit of these dual purposes—instructing and pleasing the reader—contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\n\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland\n\nThe Bluest Eye\n\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\n\nCandide\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nThe Crucible\n\nDon Quixote\n\nThe Edible Woman\n\nEmma\n\nGulliver’s Travels\n\nA Handful of Dust\n\nLife of Pi\n\nLysistrata\n\nMan and Superman\n\nMidnight’s Children\n\nMoby-Dick\n\nMoll Flanders\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\n\nThe Piano Lesson\n\nThe Pilgrim’s Progress\n\nThe Portrait of a Lady\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\n\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\n\nRasselas\n\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\n\nSiddhartha\n\nTartuffe\n\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God\n\nTwelfth Night\n\nUncle Tom’s Cabin\n\nWaiting for Godot\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?",
