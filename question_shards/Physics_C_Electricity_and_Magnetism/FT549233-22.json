    "description": "In Derek Walcott’s poem “XIV,” published in 1984, the speaker recalls a childhood experience of visiting an elderly woman storyteller. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Walcott uses literary elements and techniques to convey the speaker’s complex experience.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nXIV\n\nWith the frenzy of an old snake shedding its skin,\n\nthe speckled road, scored with ruts, smelling of mold,\n\ntwisted on itself and reentered the forest\n\nwhere the dasheen1 leaves thicken and folk stories begin.\n\n(5) Sunset would threaten us as we climbed closer\n\nto her house up the asphalt hill road, whose yam vines\n\nwrangled over gutters with the dark reek of moss,\n\nthe shutters closing like the eyelids of that mimosa2\n\ncalled Ti-Marie; then—lucent as paper lanterns,\n\n(10) lamplight glowed through the ribs, house after house—\n\nthere was her own lamp at the black twist of the path.\n\nThere’s childhood, and there’s childhood’s aftermath.\n\nShe began to remember at the minute of the fireflies,\n\nto the sound of pipe water banging in kerosene tins,\n\n(15) stories she told to my brother and myself.\n\nHer leaves were the libraries of the Caribbean.\n\nThe luck that was ours, those fragrant origins!\n\nHer head was magnificent, Sidone. In the gully of her voice\n\nshadows stood up and walked, her voice travels my shelves.\n\n(20) She was the lamplight in the stare of two mesmerized boys\n\nstill joined in one shadow, indivisible twins.\n\n1dasheen: tropical plant with large leaves\n\n2mimosa: tropical plant whose leaves close or droop when touched or shaken\n\n“XIV” from MIDSUMMER by Derek Walcott.
