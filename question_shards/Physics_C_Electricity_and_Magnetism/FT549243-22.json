A new one.\n\n(5)   The man rubs his chin, scratches his ear.\n\nIn a room full of books in a world\n\nof stories, he can recall\n\nnot one, and soon, he thinks, the boy\n\nwill give up on his father.\n\n(10)   Already the man lives far ahead, he sees\n\nthe day this boy will go. Don’t go!\n\nHear the alligator story! The angel story once more!\n\nYou love the spider story. You laugh at the spider.\n\nLet me tell it!\n\n(15)   But the boy is packing his shirts,\n\nhe is looking for his keys. Are you a god,\n\nthe man screams, that I sit mute before you?\n\nAm I a god that I should never disappoint?\n\nBut the boy is here. Please, Baba, a story?\n\n(20)   It is an emotional rather than logical equation,\n\nan earthly rather than heavenly one,\n\nwhich posits that a boy’s supplications\n\nand a father’s love add up to silence.\n\nLi-Young Lee, “A Story” from The City in Which I Love You.
