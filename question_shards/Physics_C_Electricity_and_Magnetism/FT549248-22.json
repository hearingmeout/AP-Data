    "description": "Palestinian American literary theorist and cultural critic Edward Said has written that “Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted.” Yet Said has also said that exile can become “a potent, even enriching” experience.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which a character experiences such a rift and becomes cut off from “home,” whether that home is the character’s birthplace, family, homeland, or other special place. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the character’s experience with exile is both alienating and enriching and how this experience contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThe American\n\nAngle of Repose\n\nAnother Country\n\nAs You Like It\n\nBrave New World\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nHeart of Darkness\n\nInvisible Man\n\nJane Eyre\n\nJasmine\n\nJude the Obscure\n\nKing Lear\n\nThe Little Foxes\n\nMadame Bovary\n\nThe Mayor of Casterbridge\n\nMy Ántonia\n\nObasan\n\nThe Odyssey\n\nOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\n\nThe Other\n\nParadise Lost\n\nThe Poisonwood Bible\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\n\nThe Road\n\nRobinson Crusoe\n\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\n\nSister Carrie\n\nSister of My Heart\n\nSnow Falling on Cedars\n\nThe Tempest\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nThe Women of Brewster Place\n\nWuthering Heights",
