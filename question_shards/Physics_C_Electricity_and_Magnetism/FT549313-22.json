    "description": "In Anne Bradstreet’s poem “The Author to Her Book,” published in 1678, the speaker addresses a book she has written. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Bradstreet uses literary elements and techniques to convey the complex attitude of the speaker.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThe Author to Her Book\n\nThou ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain,\n\nWho after birth did'st by my side remain,\n\nTil snatched from thence by friends, less wise than true,\n\nWho thee abroad exposed to public view;\n\n(5)   Made thee in rags, halting, to the press to trudge,\n\nWhere errors were not lessened, all may judge.\n\nAt thy return my blushing was not small,\n\nMy rambling brat (in print) should mother call,\n\nI cast thee by as one unfit for light,\n\n(10)   Thy visage was so irksome in my sight;\n\nYet being mine own, at length affection would\n\nThy blemishes amend, if so I could.\n\nI washed thy face, but more defects I saw,\n\nAnd rubbing off a spot, still made a flaw.\n\n(15)   I Stretched thy joints to make thee even feet,\n\nYet still thou run'st more hobbling than is meet;\n\nIn better dress to trim thee was my mind,\n\nBut nought save homespun cloth in the house I find.\n\nIn this array, 'mongst vulgars may’st thou roam;\n\n(20)       In critics’ hands beware thou dost not come;\n\nAnd take thy way where yet thou are not known.\n\nIf for thy Father asked, say thou had'st none;\n\nAnd for thy Mother, she alas is poor,\n\nWhich caused her thus to send thee out of door.\n\n(1678)",
