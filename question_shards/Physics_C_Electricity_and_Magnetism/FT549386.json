    "question": "In the circuit shown above left, the switch S is initially in the open position and the capacitor C is initially uncharged. A voltage probe and a computer (not shown) are used to measure the potential difference across the capacitor as a function of time after the switch is closed. The graph produced by the computer is shown above right. The battery has an emf of 20 V and negligible internal resistance. Resistor R1 has a resistance of 15 kΩ and the capacitor C has a capacitance of 20 μF.\n\nDetermine the voltage across resistor R2 immediately after the switch is closed.\n\nDetermine the voltage across resistor R2 a long time after the switch is closed.\n\nCalculate the value of the resistor R2.\n\nCalculate the energy stored in the capacitor a long time after the switch is closed.\n\nOn the axes below, graph the current in R2 as a function of time from 0 to 15 s. Label the vertical axis with appropriate values.\n\nResister R2 is removed and replaced with another resistor of lesser resistance. Switch S remains closed for a long time.\n\nIndicate below whether the energy stored in the capacitor is greater than, less than, or the same as it was with resistor R2 in the circuit.\n\nExplain your reasoning.",
