    "question": "In the circuit shown above left, the switch S is initially in the open position and the capacitor C is initially uncharged. A voltage probe and a computer (not shown) are used to measure the potential difference across the capacitor as a function of time after the switch is closed. The graph produced by the computer is shown above right. The battery has an emf of 20 V and negligible internal resistance. Resistor R1 has a resistance of 15 kΩ and the capacitor C has a capacitance of 20 μF. Determine the voltage across resistor R2 immediately after the switch is closed. Determine the voltage across resistor R2 a long time after the switch is closed. Calculate the value of the resistor R2. Calculate the energy stored in the capacitor a long time after the switch is closed. On the axes below, graph the current in R2 as a function of time from 0 to 15 s. Label the vertical axis with appropriate values. Resister R2 is removed and replaced with another resistor of lesser resistance. Switch S remains closed for a long time. Indicate below whether the energy stored in the capacitor is greater than, less than, or the same as it was with resistor R2 in the circuit. Explain your reasoning.",
