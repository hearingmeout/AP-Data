    "question": "A physics student wishes to measure the resistivity of slightly conductive paper that has a thickness of 1.0 x 10–4 m. The student cuts a sheet of the conductive paper into strips of width 0.02 m and varying lengths, making five resistors labeled R1 to R5. Using an ohmmeter, the student measures the resistance of each strip, as shown above. The data are recorded below. Use the grid below to plot a linear graph of the data points from which the resistivity of the paper can be determined. Include labels and scales for both axes. Draw the straight line that best represents the data. Using the graph, calculate the resistivity of the paper. The student uses resistors R4 and R5 to build a circuit using wire, a 1.5 V battery, an uncharged 10 µF capacitor, and an open switch, as shown above. Calculate the time constant of the circuit. At time t = 0, the student closes the switch. On the axes below, sketch the magnitude of the voltage Vc across the capacitor and the magnitudes of the voltages VR4 and VR5 across each resistor as functions of time t. Clearly label each curve according to the circuit element it represents. On the axes, explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with values or expressions, as appropriate.",
