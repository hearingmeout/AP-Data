    "question": "A rectangular loop of copper wire of resistance R has width a and length b. The loop is stationary in a constant, uniform magnetic field B0 , directed into the page as shown above. What is the net magnetic flux through the loop of wire? What is the induced emf in the loop of wire? What is the net magnetic force on the loop of wire? Suppose instead that the uniform magnetic field varies with time t according to the relationship B = B0 cos 𝝎t, where 𝝎 and B0 are positive constants and B is positive when the field is directed into the page. Indicate on the diagram below the direction of the induced current in the loop when 𝝎t = 𝜋2, after the magnetic field begins to oscillate. Derive the expression for the magnitude of the induced current in the loop as a function of time in terms of a, b, B0 , 𝝎 , R, t, and fundamental constants. On the axes below, sketch a graph of the induced current I versus 𝝎t , taking clockwise current to be positive. State explicitly the maximum value of the current I.",
