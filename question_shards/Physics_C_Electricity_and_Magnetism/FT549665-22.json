    "description": "In Mary Oliver’s poem “Crossing the Swamp,” published in 1978, the speaker contemplates her experience traveling through a swamp. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Oliver uses literary elements and techniques to develop the complex relationship between the speaker and the swamp.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nCrossing the Swamp\n\nHere is the endless\n\nwet thick\n\ncosmos, the center\n\nof everything—the nugget\n\n(5)   of dense sap, branching\n\nvines, the dark burred\n\nfaintly belching\n\nbogs. Here\n\nis swamp, here\n\n(10)       is struggle,\n\nclosure—\n\npathless, seamless,\n\npeerless mud. My bones\n\nknock together at the pale\n\n(15)          joints, trying\n\nfor foothold, fingerhold,\n\nmindhold over\n\nsuch slick crossings, deep\n\nhipholes, hummocks*\n\n(20)              that sink silently\n\ninto the black, slack\n\nearthsoup. I feel\n\nnot wet so much as\n\npainted and glittered\n\n(25)   with the fat grassy\n\nmires, the rich\n\nand succulent marrows\n\nof earth—a poor\n\ndry stick given\n\n(30)       one more chance by the whims\n\nof swamp water—a bough\n\nthat still, after all these years,\n\ncould take root,\n\nsprout, branch out, bud—\n\n(35)           make of its life a breathing\n\npalace of leaves.\n\n* low mounds of earth\n\nFrom AMERICAN PRIMITIVE by Mary Oliver.\n\nCopyright © 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 by Mary\n\nOliver; First Appeared in ATLANTIC MONTHLY (1980).\n\nBy permission of Little, Brown and Company, (Inc.).",
