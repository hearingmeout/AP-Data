    "description": "In Ted Hughes’ poem “To Paint a Water Lily,” published in 1960, the speaker examines a water lily in its environment. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Hughes uses literary elements and techniques to convey the speaker’s complex attitudes toward nature and the artist’s task.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nTo Paint a Water Lily\n\nA green level of lily leaves\n\nRoofs the pond’s chamber and paves\n\nThe flies’ furious arena: study\n\nThese, the two minds of this lady.\n\n(5)First observe the air’s dragonfly\n\nThat eats meat, that bullets by\n\nOr stands in space to take aim;\n\nOthers as dangerous comb the hum\n\nUnder the trees. There are battle-shouts\n\n(10)And death-cries everywhere hereabouts\n\nBut inaudible, so the eyes praise\n\nTo see the colours of these flies\n\nRainbow their arcs, spark, or settle\n\nCooling like beads of molten metal\n\n(15)Through the spectrum. Think what worse\n\nIs the pond-bed’s matter of course;\n\nPrehistoric bedragonned times\n\nCrawl that darkness with Latin names,\n\nHave evolved no improvements there,\n\n(20)Jaws for heads, the set stare,\n\nIgnorant of age as of hour—\n\nNow paint the long-necked lily-flower\n\nWhich, deep in both worlds, can be still\n\nAs a painting, trembling hardly at all\n\n(25)Though the dragonfly alight,\n\nWhatever horror nudge her root.\n\n—“To Paint a Water Lily” from Collected Poems by Ted Hughes (1930–1998), published by Faber and Faber Ltd [www.faber.co.uk].
