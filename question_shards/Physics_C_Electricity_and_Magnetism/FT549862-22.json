    "description": "“You can leave home all you want, but home will never leave you.”\n\n—Sonsyrea Tate\n\nSonsyrea Tate’s statement suggests that “home” may be conceived of as a dwelling, a place, or a state of mind. It may have positive or negative associations, but in either case, it may have a considerable influence on an individual. Either from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which a central character leaves home yet finds that home remains significant. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze the continuing influence of “home” on the character and how that contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nAbsalom, Absalom!\n\nAll the Pretty Horses\n\nBeloved\n\nBleak House\n\nCandide\n\nThe Cherry Orchard\n\nThe Country of the Pointed Firs\n\nFences\n\nA Free Life: A Novel\n\nThe Glass Menagerie\n\nThe God of Small Things\n\nGoing After Cacciato\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nHome to Harlem\n\nA House for Mr. Biswas\n\nThe House of Mirth\n\nThe House on Mango Street\n\nThe Inheritance of Loss\n\nInvisible Man\n\nJane Eyre\n\nThe Little Foxes\n\nLook Homeward, Angel\n\nThe Namesake\n\nNever Let Me Go\n\nThe Piano Lesson\n\nThe Poisonwood Bible\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\n\nThe Road\n\nSong of Solomon\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n\nSula\n\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nWise Blood\n\nThe Women of Brewster Place\n\nWuthering Heights",
