    "description": "In The Writing of Fiction (1925), novelist Edith Wharton states the following.\n\nAt every stage in the progress of his tale the novelist must rely on what may be called the illuminating incident to reveal and emphasize the inner meaning of each situation. Illuminating incidents are the magic casements of fiction, its vistas on infinity.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which an “illuminating” episode serves as a “casement,” a window that opens onto meaning. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the “illuminating” episode contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\n\nAs I Lay Dying\n\nThe Awakening\n\nBeloved\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye\n\nDr. Faustus\n\nEmma\n\nThe Good Soldier\n\nHeart of Darkness\n\nM.
