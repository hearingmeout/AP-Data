    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A drug company currently sells a prescription pain reliever that has been shown to be effective at lowering arthritis pain. However, since the drug also causes stomach irritation in some patients, the company has created a new formulation that it hopes will reduce that side effect. To see if the new formulation reduces the occurrence of stomach irritation for users of the pain reliever, the company conducted a small preliminary study to compare the new formulation with the current pain reliever. In the preliminary study of 100 subjects with arthritis, 50 were randomly assigned to take the current pain reliever and 50 were randomly assigned to take the new formulation. Patient responses at the end of the study are summarized in the table below. Do the data from the preliminary study indicate, at the 10 percent level of significance, that the new formulation helps to reduce the proportion of patients with stomach irritation compared to the current pain reliever? (The conditions for inference have been checked and verified.) Based on your conclusion in part (a), which type of error, Type I or Type II, is possible? Describe the consequences of each error in the context of this study. After the preliminary study, one of the researchers of the company suggested that the procedure described above would have more statistical power if the sample size was increased and recommended that a simulation study be conducted to investigate that more completely. For the purposes of the simulation, the researcher assumed that 40 percent of the patients on the current pain reliever will have stomach irritation and that only 30 percent of the patients on the new formulation will have stomach irritation. Further, the total sample size will now be 200, with 100 subjects randomly assigned to each treatment. One-hundred trials of the simulation were conducted, and a p-value was calculated for each trial based on the testing procedure, significance level, and hypotheses used in part (a). A histogram of the p-values is given below. Use the information in the histogram to estimate the power of the test if the test is performed at the 0.10 level of significance. Indicate how you obtained your estimate. Explain, in the context of this study, what the value obtained in part (c) represents.",
