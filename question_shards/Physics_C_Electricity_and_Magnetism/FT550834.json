    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.In ecology, a measure of diversity of a species in a certain population is called the diversity index. The diversity index D is defined as the probability that any two organisms selected at random from the population will be from different species.If every organism in a population is from the same species, what is the value of the diversity index D ? Explain.Consider a large population of turtles in which 30 percent of the population are snapping turtles and 70 percent of the population are box turtles. What is the value of the diversity index D for the population?Suppose a large population of turtles consists only of two species, snapping turtle and box turtle, but the percentages of the species in the population are not known. What is the maximum possible value of the diversity index D for the population? Justify your answer.",
