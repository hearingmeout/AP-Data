    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. A survey will be conducted to examine the educational level of adult heads of households in the United States. Each respondent in the survey will be placed into one of the following two categories: Does not have a high school diploma Has a high school diploma The survey will be conducted using a telephone interview. Random-digit dialing will be used to select the sample. For this survey, state one potential source of bias and describe how it might affect the estimate of the proportion of adult heads of households in the United States who do not have a high school diploma. A pilot survey indicated that about 22 percent of the population of adult heads of households do not have a high school diploma. Using this information, how many respondents should be obtained if the goal of the survey is to estimate the proportion of the population who do not have a high school diploma to within 0.03 with 95 percent confidence? Justify your answer. Since education is largely the responsibility of each state, the agency wants to be sure that estimates are available for each state as well as for the nation. Identify a sampling method that will achieve this additional goal and briefly describe a way to select the survey sample using this method.",
