    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Two parents have each built a toy catapult for use in a game at an elementary school fair. To play the game, students will attempt to launch Ping-Pong balls from the catapults so that the balls land within a 5-centimeter band. A target line will be drawn through the middle of the band, as shown in the figure below. All points on the target line are equidistant from the launching location. If a ball lands within the shaded band, the student will win a prize. The parents have constructed the two catapults according to slightly different plans. They want to test these catapults before building additional ones. Under identical conditions, the parents launch 40 Ping-Pong balls from each catapult and measure the distance that the ball travels before landing. Distances to the nearest centimeter are graphed in the dotplots below. Comment on any similarities and any differences in the two distributions of distances traveled by balls launched from catapult A and catapult B. If the parents want to maximize the probability of having the Ping-Pong balls land within the band, which one of the two catapults, A or B, would be better to use than the other? Justify your choice. Using the catapult that you chose in part (b), how many centimeters from the target line should this catapult be placed? Explain why you chose this distance.",
