Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Auric Miners, Inc., won a contract to mine gold from the terrain represented in the diagram above. The terrain can be divided into 20 rectangular blocks, each with a volume of 200 cubic meters. Site analysis has revealed the average gold content of each block, as designated by the different patterns shown in the legend.Calculate the volume of gold, in cubic meters, that can be mined from the excavation of all 20 blocks. Show all work.Calculate the percent of gold in the total excavation. Show all work.If the total cost of excavating and extracting the gold is $1,520,000, calculate the price that the gold must be sold for, in dollars per gram, in order for the mine to break even. (The density of gold is 19 g/cm3 .)Describe TWO potential uses for the mine waste that will be produced during the extraction of the gold from the excavated material.Describe TWO environmental problems that are likely to develop at the mine site after the gold has been extracted and the mine is abandoned.",
