    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. An administrator at a large university is interested in determining whether the residential status of a student is associated with level of participation in extracurricular activities. Residential status is categorized as on campus for students living in university housing and off campus otherwise. A simple random sample of 100 students in the university was taken, and each student was asked the following two questions. Are you an on campus student or an off campus student? In how many extracurricular activities do you participate? The responses of the 100 students are summarized in the frequency table shown. a. Calculate the proportion of on campus students in the sample who participate in at least one extracurricular activity and the proportion of off campus students in the sample who participate in at least one extracurricular activity. On campus proportion: Off campus proportion: The responses of the 100 students are summarized in the segmented bar graph shown. b. Write a few sentences summarizing what the graph reveals about the association between residential status and level of participation in extracurricular activities among the 100 students in the sample. c. After verifying that the conditions for inference were satisfied, the administrator performed a chi-square test of the following hypotheses. H0 : There is no association between residential status and level of participation in extracurricular activities among the students at the university. Ha : There is an association between residential status and level of participation in extracurricular activities among the students at the university. The test resulted in a p-value of 0.23. Based on the p-value, what conclusion should the administrator make?",
