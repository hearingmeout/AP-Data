Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A researcher conducted a study to investigate whether local car dealers tend to charge women more than men for the same car model. Using information from the county tax collector’s records, the researcher randomly selected one man and one woman from among everyone who had purchased the same model of an identically equipped car from the same dealer. The process was repeated for a total of 8 randomly selected car models. The purchase prices and the differences (woman – man) are shown in the table below. Summary statistics are also shown. Dotplots of the data and the differences are shown below. Do the data provide convincing evidence that, on average, women pay more than men in the county for the same car model?",
