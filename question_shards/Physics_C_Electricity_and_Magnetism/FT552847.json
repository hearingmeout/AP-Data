It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nYeast cells are placed in an apparatus with a solution of sugar (a major nutrient for yeast metabolism). The apparatus detects bubbles of gas released by the yeast cells. The rate of respiration varies with the surrounding temperatures as indicated by the data below.",
