It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nAccording to fossil records and recent published observations, two species of leaf-eating beetles (species A and B) have existed on an isolated island in the Pacific Ocean for over 100,000 years. In 1964 a third species of leaf-eating beetle (species C) was accidentally introduced on the island. The population size of each species has been regularly monitored as shown in the graph above.",
