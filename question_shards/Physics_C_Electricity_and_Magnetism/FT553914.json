It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nAn experiment on a species of small freshwater fish recorded their behavioral responses to different temperatures. Ten fish were each tested once, one at a time. To begin the experiment, a fish was removed from a stock tank (maintained at 22oC) and placed in the temperature-gradient tank drawn below. After the fish had spent 30 minutes in the temperature-gradient tank, the section where the fish was located was recorded. Additional observations were recorded every 5 minutes, for a total of 7 observations per fish. A summary of the combined data for all 10 fish appears below.",
