It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nAn experiment was conducted to measure the reaction rate of the human salivary enzyme α-amylase. Ten mL of a concentrated starch solution and 1.0 mL of α-amylase solution were placed in a test tube. The test tube was inverted several times to mix the solution and then incubated at 25°C. The amount of product (maltose) present was measured every 10 minutes for an hour. The results are given in the table below.",
