    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nA new species of fly was discovered on an island in the South Pacific. Several different crosses were performed, each using 100 females and 100 males. The phenotypes of the parents and the resulting offspring were recorded. Cross I: True-breeding bronze-eyed males were crossed with true-breeding red-eyed females. All the F1 offspring had bronze eyes. F1 flies were crossed, and the data for the resulting F2 flies are given in the table below.\n\nCross II: True-breeding normal-winged males were crossed with true-breeding stunted-winged females. All the F1 offspring had stunted wings. F1 flies were crossed, and the data for the resulting F2 flies are given in the table below.\n\nCross III: True-breeding bronze-eyed, stunted-winged males were crossed with true-breeding red-eyed, normal-winged females. All the F1 offspring had bronze eyes and stunted wings. The F1 flies were crossed with true- breeding red-eyed, normal-winged flies, and the results are shown in the table below.",
