    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nOn a trip to a dense forest, a biologist noticed that millipedes (small invertebrates) were plentiful under logs but were rarely seen in any other location.",
    "question": "For ONE of the abiotic environmental variables you chose above, design a controlled experiment to test a hypothesis that this factor affects the distribution of millipedes on the forest floor. Describe data that would support your hypothesis.",
