    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nOn a trip to a dense forest, a biologist noticed that millipedes (small invertebrates) were plentiful under logs but were rarely seen in any other location.",
    "question": "Suppose that you were examining the distribution of a plant, instead of the millipede. Describe modifications in the experiment that you designed in (b) that would be required to determine whether the abiotic factor you chose affects the distribution of the plant.",
