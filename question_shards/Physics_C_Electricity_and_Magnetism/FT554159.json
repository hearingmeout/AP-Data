    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nMammalian milk contains antibodies that are produced by the mother's immune system and passed to offspring during feeding. Mammalian milk also contains a sugar (lactose) and may contain proteins (protein A, protein B, and casein), as indicated in the table.",
    "question": "Using the data in the table, construct a cladogram on the template provided to indicate the most likely evolutionary relationships among the different mammals. Indicate on the cladogram where each of the characters most likey arose in the evolutionary process, and justify the placement of the characters on the cladogram.",
