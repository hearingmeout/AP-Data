It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nAdult male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) exhibit genetically determined spots, while juvenile and adult female guppies lack spots. In a study of selection, male and female guppies from genetically diverse populations were collected from different mountain streams and placed together in an isolated environment containing no predators. The study population was maintained for several generations in the isolated area before being separated into two groups. One group was moved to an artificial pond containing a fish predator, while a second group was moved to an artificial pond containing no predators. The two groups went through several generations in their new environments. At different times during the experiment, the mean number of spots per adult male guppy was determined as shown in the figure below. Vertical bars in the figure represent two standard errors of the mean (SEM).",
