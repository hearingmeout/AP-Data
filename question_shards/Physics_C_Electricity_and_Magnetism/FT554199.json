    "description": "Directions: This is a long free-response question that requires about 22 minutes to answer.\n\nRead the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nCellular respiration includes the metabolic pathways of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, as represented in the figures. In cellular respiration, carbohydrates and other metabolites are oxidized, and the resulting energy-transfer reactions support the synthesis of ATP.",
    "question": "Using the information above, describe ONE contribution of each of the following in ATP synthesis.\n\nCatabolism of glucose in glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation\n\nOxidation of intermediates in the Krebs cycle\n\nFormation of a proton gradient by the electron transport chain",
