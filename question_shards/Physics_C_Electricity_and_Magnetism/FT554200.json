    "description": "Directions: This is a long free-response question that requires about 22 minutes to answer.\n\nRead the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nCellular respiration includes the metabolic pathways of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, as represented in the figures. In cellular respiration, carbohydrates and other metabolites are oxidized, and the resulting energy-transfer reactions support the synthesis of ATP.",
    "question": "Use each of the following observations to justify the claim that glycolysis first occurred in a common ancestor of all living organisms.\n\nNearly all existing organisms perform glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis occurs under anaerobic conditions.\n\nGlycolysis occurs only in the cytosol.",
