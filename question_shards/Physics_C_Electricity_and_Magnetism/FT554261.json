    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nPhylogeny reflects the evolutionary history of organisms.",
    "question": "The two phylogenetic trees represent the relationship of whales to six other mammals. All of the organisms shown have a pulley-shaped astragalus bone in the ankle except for the whale.\n\nFor each tree, describe a monophyletic group, the closest relative to the whale, and the point at which the pulley astragalus was lost or gained.\n\nBased on the principle of parsimony (the simplest explanation is the best) and the genomic information in the table shown, identify which tree is the best representation of the evolutionary relationship of these animals, and justify your answer.",
