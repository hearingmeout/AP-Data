Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nIn an attempt to rescue a small isolated population of snakes from decline, a few male snakes from several larger populations of the same species were introduced into the population in 1992. The snakes reproduce sexually, and there are abundant resources in the environment.\n\nThe figure below shows the results of a study of the snake population both before and after the introduction of the outside males. In the study, the numbers of captured snakes indicate the overall population size.",
