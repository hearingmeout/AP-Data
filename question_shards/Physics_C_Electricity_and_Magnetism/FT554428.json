    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nIn an investigation of fruit-fly behavior, a covered choice chamber is used to test whether the spatial distribution of flies is affected by the presence of a substance placed at one end of the chamber. To test the flies’ preference for glucose, 60 flies are introduced into the middle of the choice chamber at the insertion point indicated by the arrow in the figure above. A cotton ball soaked with a 10 percent glucose solution is placed at one end of the chamber, and a dry cotton ball with no solution is placed at the other end. The positions of flies are observed and recorded every minute for 10 minutes.",
