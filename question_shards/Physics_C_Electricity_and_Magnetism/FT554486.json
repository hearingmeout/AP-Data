    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nThe table below shows the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal segment of a conserved polypeptide from four different, but related, species. Each amino acid is represented by a three-letter abbreviation, and the amino acid residues in the polypeptide chains are numbered from the amino end to the carboxyl end. Empty cells indicate no amino acid is present.",
    "question": "Assuming that species I is the ancestral species of the group, explain the most likely genetic change that produced the polypeptide in species II and the most likely genetic change that produced the polypeptide in species III.",
