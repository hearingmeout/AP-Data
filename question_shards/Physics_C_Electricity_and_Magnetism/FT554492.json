    "description": "Directions: Answers must be in essay form. Outline form is not acceptable. Labeled diagrams may be used to supplement discussion, but in no case will a diagram alone suffice. It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nThe table below shows the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal segment of a conserved polypeptide from four different, but related, species. Each amino acid is represented by a three-letter abbreviation, and the amino acid residues in the polypeptide chains are numbered from the amino end to the carboxyl end. Empty cells indicate no amino acid is present.",
