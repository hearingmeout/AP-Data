    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nRead the article below and answer the questions that follow.\n\nThe Floridian Daily - May 21, 2013\n\nThe small community located on the edge of the magnificent wetlands of Florida's Everglades was the site of a press conference today where Governor Gayle Moss announced that the restoration of the Everglades is successfully underway. She noted that the Everglades ecosystem has suffered threats to its water quality, water quantity, and habitats in recent decades. Moss noted that intensive urban and agricultural development in adjacent areas has diverted substantial amounts of freshwater resources and impaired water quality. Governor Moss then emphasized that the preservation and enhancements of the Everglades, key goals of the restoration program, are absolutely essential for the continued environmental and economic health of the state. She closed the press conference by saying, \"The Everglades is a gem not only for Florida but for the entire world. Each of us has the responsibility to do our part to preserve this magnificent resource.\" \n\nDescribe how TWO human activities, other than those that result in anthropogenic climate change,have resulted in a decrease in the amount of freshwater flowing into the Everglades ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to water quantity problems, the Everglades is faced with a variety of water quality issues.For example, phosphorus concentrations in the Everglades have increased since the 1960s.\n\nDescribe how one specific human activity contributes to increased phosphorus levels in the Everglades.\n\nExplain one way in which an increase in phosphorus levels can adversely affect the Everglades ecosystem.\n\nDescribe one step that could be taken to reduce phosphorus inputs from the activity you identified in part (i).\n\nClimate change could have a variety of impacts on water quantity, water quality, and habitat. For EACH of these three factors, identify and describe one specific example of an impact on the Everglades likely to result from climate change.\n\nThe article states that Governor Moss believes that the “preservation and enhancement of the Everglades, key goals of the restoration program, are absolutely essential for the continued environmental and economic health of the state.”\n\nDescribe one way that restoring water quantity and water quality in the Everglades is expected to improve the structure and function of the ecosystem.\n\nDescribe one way that restoring the Everglades is expected to provide economic benefits to Florida.",
