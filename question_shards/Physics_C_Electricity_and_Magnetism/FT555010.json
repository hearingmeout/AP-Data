    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. A simple random sample of 9 students was selected from a large university. Each of these students reported the number of hours he or she had allocated to studying and the number of hours allocated to work each week. A least squares linear regression was performed and part of the resulting computer output is shown below. The scatterplot below displays the data that were collected from the 9 students. After point P, labeled on the graph on the previous page, was removed from the data, a second linear regression was performed and the computer output is shown below. Does point P exercise a large influence on the regression line? Explain. The researcher who conducted the study discovered that the number of hours spent studying reported by the student represented by P was recorded incorrectly. The corrected data point for this student is represented by the letter Q in the scatterplot below. Explain how the least squares regression line for the corrected data (in this part) would differ from the least squares regression line for the original data.",
