Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. At a certain university, students who live in the dormitories eat at a common dining hall. Recently, some students have been complaining about the quality of the food served there. The dining hall manager decided to do a survey to estimate the proportion of students living in the dormitories who think that the quality of the food should be improved. One evening, the manager asked the first 100 students entering the dining hall to answer the following question. In this setting, explain how bias may have been introduced based on the way this convenience sample was selected and suggest how the sample could have been selected differently to avoid that bias. In this setting, explain how bias may have been introduced based on the way the question was worded and suggest how it could have been worded differently to avoid that bias.",
