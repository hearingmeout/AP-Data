    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Four different statistics have been proposed as estimators of a population parameter. To investigate the behavior of these estimators, 500 random samples are selected from a known population and each statistic is calculated for each sample. The true value of the population parameter is 75. The graphs below show the distribution of values for each statistic. Which of the statistics appear to be unbiased estimators of the population parameter? How can you tell? Which of statistics A or B would be a better estimator of the population parameter? Explain your choice. Which of statistics C or D would be a better estimator of the population parameter? Explain your choice.",
