    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. An advertising agency in a large city is conducting a survey of adults to investigate whether there is an association between highest level of educational achievement and primary source for news. The company takes a random sample of 2,500 adults in the city. The results are shown in the table below. If an adult is to be selected at random from this sample, what is the probability that the selected adult is a college graduate or obtains news primarily from the internet? If an adult who is a college graduate is to be selected at random from this sample, what is the probability that the selected adult obtains news primarily from the internet? When selecting an adult at random from the sample of 2,500 adults, are the events “is a college graduate” and “obtains news primarily from the internet” independent? Justify your answer. The company wants to conduct a statistical test to investigate whether there is an association between educational achievement and primary source for news for adults in the city. What is the name of the statistical test that should be used? What are the appropriate degrees of freedom for this test?",
