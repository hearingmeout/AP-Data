    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.The active ingredients in many pesticides are chemical compounds that kill organisms such as insects, molds, and weeds. Proponents claim that the use of pesticides improves crop yields and thus protects land and soil by reducing the conversion of forests and wetlands to cropland. Opponents of pesticide use claim that pesticides degrade water and soil quality and that other modern agricultural techniques and practices are responsible for the improved crop yields in recent years.Design a laboratory experiment to determine whether or not a new pesticide (product X) is toxic to minnows, a type of small fish. For the experiment you design, be sure to do all of the following.State the hypothesis.Describe the method you would use to test your hypothesis.Identify the control.Identify the dependent variable.Describe experimental results that would lead you to reject your hypothesis in part (a)(i). (Be specific.)One strategy for dealing with agricultural pests is integrated pest management (IPM).Describe IPM. As part of your description, include TWO specific pest-control approaches that are part of IPM.Identify one environmental benefit of using IPM.Describe TWO agricultural practices, other than those involving pest control, that increase crop yields.",
