    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nThe Colorado River flows from the Colorado Rockies to the Gulf of California. The primary source of Colorado River water is melting Rocky Mountain snowpack. Once the river descends from the Rockies, it flows through a landscape that is dominated by desert. Colorado River water carries a high load of sediment.\n\nMultiple dams have been erected along the Colorado River. Identify TWO benefits other than agriculture and recreation that people derive from that system of dams.\n\nDiscuss TWO potential environmental consequences of damming a major river.\n\nCompetition for access to Colorado River water has increased dramatically due to increased population size and intensive agricultural use. Describe TWO conservation strategies for reducing agricultural water consumption.\n\nIdentify TWO possible environmental consequences of climate change on the hydrology of the Colorado River system.\n\nIn addition to impacts on the Colorado River system, climate change is impacting the hydrology of coastal ecosystems. Identify and describe TWO possible consequences of climate change on coastal ecosystems.",
