Describe an environmental problem associated with EACH of these methods.\n\nThe final step in sewage treatment is disinfection. Identify ONE pollutant that is targeted during disinfection and identify ONE commonly used method of disinfection.\n\nIdentify ONE United States federal law that requires monitoring the quality of the treated sewage that is discharged into the Fremont River.",
