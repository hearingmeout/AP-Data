    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. After reading the following excerpt from an article about the interrelationships among organisms in an oak forest, answer parts (a), (b), and (c), which follow. Chain Reactions Linking Acorns to Gypsy Moth Outbreaks and Lyme Disease Risk Oak trees (Quercus spp.) produce large autumnal acorn crops every two to five years, and produce few or no acorns during intervening years. Acorns are a critical food for white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Mice are important predators of the pupal stage of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). This introduced insect periodically undergoes outbreaks that defoliate millions of hectares of oak forests, decreasing tree growth, survival, and acorn crop production. An abundance of acorns provides food for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Mice and deer are the primary hosts of the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis), which carries Lyme disease. In the space provided below, diagram a food web based on the interrelationships of the organisms identified in the excerpt. Design a controlled experiment that tests the relationship between acorn production and gypsy moth population. Include the hypothesis that the experiment tests. Briefly describe a strategy that uses integrated pest management for the control of the black-legged tick population.",
