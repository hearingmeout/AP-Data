    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Students in an environmental science class at Fremont High School tested the water quality in a stream near their school. They were concerned about the possible pollution of the stream, which flows through a farm on which hogs are raised. Shown below are a diagram that indicates the sites where the students collected water samples (labeled A through D, upstream to downstream) and a table of the results of the students' water tests. Assess the likelihood that animal waste is contaminating the water. Discuss the scientific basis of your assessment. Describe two additional tests that could be used in monitoring the quality of the water in the stream. For each test, describe the patterns you would expect from sites A through D. Describe a sequence of ecological changes that might result from the discharge of animal waste into a body of water. The Clean Water Act was first passed in the United States in 1972 and has been amended several times since then. Describe two specific provisions of this legislation that would be likely to apply to the quality of the stream water.",
