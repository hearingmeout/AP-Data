    "description": "In Rachel M. Harper’s poem “The Myth of Music,” published in 1999, the speaker reflects on music she heard during her childhood. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Harper uses literary elements and techniques to develop the relationship between music and the speaker’s complex memories of her family.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThe Myth of Music\n\nfor my father\n\nIf music can be passed on\n\nlike brown eyes or a strong\n\nleft hook, this melody\n\nis my inheritance, lineage traced\n\n(5)through a title track,\n\ndisplayed on an album cover\n\nthat you pin to the wall\n\nas art, oral history taught\n\non a record player, the lessons\n\n(10)sealed into the grooves like fact.\n\nThis is the only myth I know.\n\nI sit on the hardwood\n\nfloors of a damp November,\n\nmy brother dealing cards\n\n(15)from an incomplete deck,\n\nand I don't realize that this\n\nmoment is the definition\n\nof family, collective memory\n\ncut in rough-textured tones,\n\n(20)the voice of a horn so familiar\n\nI don't know I'm listening,\n\nDon't know I'm singing,\n\na child's improvisation\n\nof Giant Steps of Impressions:1\n\n(25)songs without lyrics\n\ncan still be sung.\n\nIn six months, when my mother\n\nis 2,000 miles away, deciding\n\nif she wants to come home,\n\n(30)I will have forgotten\n\nthis moment, the security\n\nof her footsteps, the warmth\n\nof a radiator on my back and you\n\npresent in the sound of typing\n\n(35)your own accompaniment,\n\nmultiphonics disguised as chords\n\nin a distant room, speakers set\n\non high to fill the whole house\n\nwith your spirit, your call\n\n(40)as a declaration of love.\n\nBut the music will remain.\n\nThe timeless notes of jazz\n\ntoo personal to play out loud,\n\nstay locked in the rhythm\n\n(45)of my childhood, memories fading\n\nlike the words of a lullaby,\n\ncome to life in a saxophone's blow.\n\nThey lie when they say\n\nmusic is universal—this is my song,\n\n(50)the notes like fingertips\n\nas delicate as breath.\n\nI will not share this air\n\nwith anyone\n\nbut you.\n\n1Giant Steps is a jazz album (1960) by John Coltrane. Impressions (1963) is another album by Coltrane.\n\nFrom “The Myth of Music” in Mending the World: Stories of Family by Contemporary Black Writers by Rachel M. Harper, copyright ©1999.
