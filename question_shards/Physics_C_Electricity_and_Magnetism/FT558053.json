    "question": "Populations of large terrestrial animals, such as African elephants and snow leopards, are in decline around the world. Many of these large animals are now on the verge of extinction. (a) Using the data provided in the table above, plot the elephant population data as points on the grid below, placing the independent variable on the x-axis. Clearly label the axes. (b) Calculate the percent loss of elephants in Africa from 1970 to 2000. Show all work. (c) The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that the elephant population will decline by 20 percent between 2015 and 2022. Use this estimate to calculate how many elephants will be left in Africa in 2022. Show all work. (d) Most large terrestrial mammals are K-strategists. Identify one characteristic of a K-strategist and explain how the characteristic you identified can make these mammals prone to extinction. (e) Identify and discuss TWO conservation strategies that could be implemented to prevent the extinction of large terrestrial mammals, such as the African elephant or snow leopard.",
