    "description": "Leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) are found in all living organisms and have been associated with the response of the marine mussel, Mytilus edulis, to changes in salinity. LAPs are enzymes that remove N-terminal amino acids from proteins and release the free amino acids into the cytosol. To investigate the evolution of LAPs in wild populations of M. edulis, researchers sampled adult mussels from several different locations along a part of the northeast coast of the United States, as shown in Figure 1. The researchers then determined the percent of individuals possessing a particular lap allele, lap94, in mussels from each sample site (table 1).",
    "question": "Based on the data, describe the most likely effect of salinity on the frequency of the lap94 allele in the marine mussel populations in Long Island Sound. Predict the likely lap94 allele frequency at a sampling site between site 1 and site 2 in Long Island Sound.",
