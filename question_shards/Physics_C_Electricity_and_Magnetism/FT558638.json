    "description": "Figure 1. Percent dry weight of different plant structures during the growing season for an annual plant\n\nThe graph above illustrates the percent dry weight of different parts of a particular annual plant (plants that live less than one year) from early May to late August. The percent dry weight can be used to estimate the amount of energy a plant uses to produce its leaves, vegetative buds, stems, roots, and reproductive parts (seeds, receptacles, and flowers).",
    "question": "Based on the data on the graph, estimate the percent of the total energy that the plant has allocated to the growth of leaves on the first day of July.",
