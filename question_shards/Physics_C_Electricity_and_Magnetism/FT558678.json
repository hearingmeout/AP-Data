    "description": "Pacific salmon and black bears have often been cited as examples of keystone species. Pacific salmon spawn in freshwater streams but spend most of their lives at sea. When mature salmon return to the freshwater streams to spawn, they are preyed upon by bears and other predators. When salmon migrate from their marine habitat to the freshwater streams, they bring nitrogen and other marine-derived nutrients that subsequently remain in the areas surrounding the streams—a process called nitrogen influx.\n\nIn an investigation, the relationship between black bears, salmon, and influx of marine nitrogen into the area around a southwestern Alaskan stream was studied. The investigators established several test plots of the same size along the stream with the following species composition: no salmon or black bears (N), bears but not salmon (B), salmon but not bears (S), and a plot where salmon and bears interact (SB). Nitrogen influx in the different sampling areas was measured as a means of assessing the impact of the different species on the health of the ecosystem. The data are plotted in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Mean nitrogen influx  as a function of species present. N = neither salmon nor bears present, B = only bears present, S = only salmon present and SB = both salmon and bears present.",
    "question": "Which of the following pieces of additional data would help further investigate the relationship between bears, salmon, and influx of nitrogen into the local environment?",
