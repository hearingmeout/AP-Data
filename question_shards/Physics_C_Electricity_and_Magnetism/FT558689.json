    "description": "Over many generations, two populations of the same species can diverge into separate species through reproductive isolation. The figures below represent a model of speciation and show the results of matings between individuals from two diverging populations at four different stages of speciation. The males represented in the model are heterogametic, which means they have two different sex-determining chromosomes, (e.g., <math> <semantics> <mrow> <mtext>XY</mtext> </mrow> <annotation encoding=\"MathType-MTEF\">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaagCart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLnhiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq=Jc9vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0=yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr=xfr=xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaaeiwaiaabMfaaaa@37AB@</annotation> </semantics> </math>).

The offspring from each mating are labeled interpopulation hybrids.\n\nFigure 1 shows the results of a mating between a male and a female from the two populations. In each subsequent figure, the males are from one of the diverging populations and the females are from the other population. The fertility and viability of the offspring from each mating are indicated in the figures.",
