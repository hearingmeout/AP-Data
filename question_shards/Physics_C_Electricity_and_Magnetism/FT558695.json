    "question": "A group of students designed an experiment to determine the effect of compost on the germination and growth of plants. The students set up experimental plots by mixing different ratios of soil and compost. They planted 20 pea and 20 melon seeds in each plot and watered each plot regularly. The students recorded the number of seeds that germinated, and as the plants grew, they recorded plant length, number and size of leaves, and general health observations.\n\nThe following observations were recorded.\n\nIn all treatments, more pea seeds germinated than melon seeds.\n\nThere was a week of rainy weather at three weeks.\n\nMelon plants developed a fungal growth at four weeks.\n\nMelon plants grew longer than pea plants, but many melon leaves showed signs of yellowing as the weeks passed.\n\nThe students concluded that pea plants grew better in compost than did melon plants.\n\nWhich of the following best addresses the validity of the conclusion made by the students?",
