On two separate islands, the scientists recorded the number of finches with long tail feathers and the number of finches with short tail feathers. The results are shown in the table below.\n\nIf the two finch populations are each in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and are isolated from each other, then which of the following graphs correctly displays the relative genotype frequencies?",
