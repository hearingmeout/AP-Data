  "content": {
    "description": "In an investigation of the effect of a particular insecticide on plant growth and development, researchers established 20 test plots containing mature Haplopappus squarrosus shrubs. H. squarrosus is pollinated by certain species of insects and is eaten by other species of insects. Ten test plots were sprayed with the water-soluble insecticide, and ten test plots were sprayed with water only. The researchers recorded the numbers of plants or plant parts at different life stages in each test plot. The results of the investigation are shown in the table.\n\nFigure 1. Student-constructed graph of data with constructed graph of data with a plotting error",
    "question": "A student incorrectly plotted one value from the table on a graph (Figure 1). Identify the error in the student-constructed graph. Provide reasoning to support the student’s choice of a logarithmic scale on the Y axis.",
