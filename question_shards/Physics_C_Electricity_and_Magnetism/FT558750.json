    "description": "Figure 1. Mean angle of the shift in turtle embryo position following exposure to a directional hear source. The error bars represent ±SEX̄.\n\nA certain species of turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) lays its eggs in nests that are buried in the sand. The turtle then leaves the eggs to develop. A researcher claims that turtle embryos are able to shift within their eggs in response to directional thermal cues in the environment. To test the claim, the researcher incubated turtle eggs in containers and used heating pads to deliver heat either to the top of the container (dorsal heating) or to one side of the container (lateral heating). The position of the lateral heat source was switched from one side to the other on day 15. The researcher recorded the shifts in embryo position relative to the initial embryo position in the egg. The results are shown in Figure 1.",
