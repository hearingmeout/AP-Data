    "description": "The pTET-KAN plasmid carries an origin of replication (ori) and genes conferring resistance to the antibiotics tetracycline (tet) and kanamycin (kan) as represented in the figure. Cultures of E. coli bacteria were transformed with the plasmid. To determine the success of the transformation experiment, the bacterial cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline overnight.",
