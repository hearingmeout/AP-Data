    "description": "The pTET-KAN plasmid carries an origin of replication (ori) and genes conferring resistance to the antibiotics tetracycline (tet) and kanamycin (kan) as represented in the figure. Cultures of E. coli bacteria were transformed with the plasmid. To determine the success of the transformation experiment, the bacterial cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline overnight.",
    "question": "Researchers inserted a small fragment of human DNA into the pTET-KAN plasmid. Cultures of E. coli were transformed with the modified plasmid. The transformed bacterial cells were able to survive in the presence of tetracycline but were unable to survive in the presence of kanamycin. Draw an \"X\" on the plasmid template provided below to indicate where the human DNA fragment was most likely inserted. Justify your placement of the inserted human DNA.",
