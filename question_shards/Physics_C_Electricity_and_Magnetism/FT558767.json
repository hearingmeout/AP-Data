    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nJean Toomer's poem \"November Cotton Flower\" was published in 1923.\n\nNovember Cotton Flower\n\nBoll-weevil’s1 coming, and the winter’s cold,\n\nMade cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,\n\nAnd cotton, scarce as any southern snow,\n\nWas vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,\n\n(5)    Failed in its function as the autumn rake;\n\nDrouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take\n\nAll water from the streams; dead birds were found\n\nIn wells a hundred feet below the ground—\n\nSuch was the season when the flower bloomed.\n\n(10)     Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed\n\nSignificance. Superstition saw\n\nSomething it had never seen before:\n\nBrown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,\n\nBeauty so sudden for that time of year.\n\n1A boll-weevil is a beetle that feeds on cotton buds.\n\n“November Cotton Flower,” from CANE by Jean Toomer.\n\nCopyright 1923 by Boni & Liveright, renewed 1951 by Jean Toomer.\n\nUsed by permission of Liveright Publishing Corporation.",
