    "description": "The following questions refer to this poem. Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers. \n\nGeorge Herbert's poem \"The Forerunners\" was published in 1633.\n\nThe Forerunners1\n\nThe harbingers are come. See, see their mark;\n\nWhite is their colour, and behold my head.\n\nBut must they have my brain? Must they dispark\n\nThose sparkling notions, which therein were bred?\n\n(5)     Must dulnesse turn me to a clod?\n\nYet have they left me, Thou art still my God.\n\nGood men ye be, to leave me my best room,\n\nEv’n all my heart, and what is lodged there:\n\nI passe2 not, I, what of the rest become,\n\n(10)   Thou art still my God, be out of fear.3\n\nHe will be pleased with that dittie;\n\nAnd if I please him, I write fine and wittie.\n\nFarewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors.\n\nBut will ye leave me thus? when ye before\n\n(15)   Of stews4 and brothels onely knew the doores,\n\nThen did I wash you with my tears, and more,\n\nBrought you to Church well drest and clad:\n\nMy God must have my best, ev’n all I had.\n\nLouely enchanting language, sugar-cane,\n\n(20)   Hony of roses, whither wilt thou flie?\n\nHath some fond5 lover tic’d6 thee to thy bane?7\n\nAnd wilt thou leave the Church, and love a stie?\n\nFie, thou wilt soil thy broider’d coat,\n\nAnd hurt thy self, and him that sings the note.\n\n(25)   Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung,\n\nWith canvas, not with arras8 clothe their shame:\n\nLet follie speak in her own native tongue.\n\nTrue beautie dwells on high: ours is a flame\n\nBut borrow’d thence to light us thither.\n\n(30)   Beautie and beauteous words should go together.\n\nYet if you go, I passe not; take your way:\n\nFor, Thou art still my God, is all that ye\n\nPerhaps with more embellishment can say.\n\nGo birds of spring: let winter have his fee,\n\n(35)   Let a bleak palenesse chalk the doore,\n\nSo all within be livelier then before.\n\n1an advance guard that traveled ahead of an important visitor to secure\n\nsuitable lodgings, the door of which would then be marked with white\n\nchalk\n\n2care\n\n3be...fear: is not endangered\n\n4houses of prostitution\n\n5foolish\n\n6enticed\n\n7ruin\n\n8rich fabric",
