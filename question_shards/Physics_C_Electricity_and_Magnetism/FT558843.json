    "description": "The following questions refer to this poem. Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nCharlotte Dacre's poem \"The Female Philosopher\" was published in 1805.\n\nThe Female Philosopher\n\nYou tell me, fair one, that you ne’er can love,\n\nAnd seem with scorn to mock the dangerous fire;\n\nBut why, then, trait’ress, do you seek to move\n\nIn others what your breast can ne’er inspire?\n\n(5)   You tell me, you my friend alone will be,\n\nYet speak of friendship in a voice so sweet,\n\nThat, while I struggle to be coldly free,\n\nI feel my heart with wildest throbbings beat.\n\nVainly indiff’rence would you bid us feel,\n\n(10)    While so much languor in those eyes appear;\n\nVainly the stoic’s happiness reveal, \n\nWhile soft emotion all your features wear.\n\nO, form’d for love! O, wherefore should you fly\n\nFrom the seducing charm it spreads around?\n\n(15)   O why enshrine your soul with apathy?\n\nOr wish in frozen fetters to be bound?\n\nLife is a darksome and a dreary day,\n\nThe solitary wretch no pleasure knows;\n\nLove is the star that lights him on his way,\n\n(20)   And guides him on to pleasure and repose.\n\nBut oft, forgetful of thy plan severe,\n\nI’ve seen thee fondly gaze—I’ve heard thee sigh;\n\nI’ve mark’d thy strain of converse, sadly dear,\n\nWhile softest rapture lighten’d from thine eye.\n\n(25)   Then have I thought some wayward youth employ’d\n\nThy secret soul, but left thee to despair,\n\nAnd oft with pleasing sorrow have enjoy’d\n\nThe task of chasing thy corrosive care.\n\nYet pride must save me from a dastard love,\n\n(30)   A grov’ling love, that cannot hope return:\n\nA soul like mine was never form’d to prove\n\nThose viler passions with which some can burn.\n\nThen fear not me; for since it is thy will,\n\nAdhere with stubborn coolness to thy vow;\n\n(35)   Grant me thy philosophic friendship still—\n\nI’ll grant thee mine with all the powers I know.",
