    "question": "A small particle with charge +q, where q << Q, is moved from point I to point II at constant speed v by an external force. WEXT is the work done by the external force on the moving charge, and WELEC is the work done by the electrostatic force. Which of the following correctly identifies the signs of these quantities?",
