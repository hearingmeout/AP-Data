    "question": "Three capacitors are connected in series to an ideal voltage source and charged, as shown in Figure 1 above. The capacitors are identical except that capacitor X has air between its plates, whereas capacitors Y and Z each have a dielectric slab of dielectric constant κ > 1 between their plates. If the dielectric slab is removed from capacitor Z, as shown in Figure 2, which of the following describes what will happen to the voltage across each capacitor?",
