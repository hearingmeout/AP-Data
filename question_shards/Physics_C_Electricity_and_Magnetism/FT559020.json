    "question": "A metal wire of resistance 10 Ω is bent into a circular hoop of radius 0.10 meter and placed in a uniform magnetic field, as shown in Figure 1 above. The magnetic field strength B as a function of time is shown in Figure 2, where positive refers to a magnetic field directed out of the page. What are the magnitude and direction of the current induced in the ring at time t = 6 s?",
