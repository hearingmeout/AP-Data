    "question": "A student is to design a circuit using a battery ε with negligible internal resistance, two uncharged capacitors C1 and C2, a resistor R, and a switch S. The circuit should be set up so that when the switch is in one position, the battery will only charge capacitor C1, and when in the second position, capacitor C1 will discharge through capacitor C2 and resistor R. Using the components shown below, draw a circuit diagram that represents a single circuit that will satisfy the criteria outlined above. The switch S is initially in position to fully charge capacitor C1. At time t = 0, the switch is moved to the second position. The charge as a function of time for both capacitors after the switch is moved is plotted on the graph below. Label each box to indicate which graph corresponds to C1 and C2. The components of the circuit have the following values: R = 1000 Ω, C1 = 2.0 μF, C2 = 6.0 μF , ε = 12 V Calculate the following for a long time after the switch has been moved to the second position. i.The charges q1 and q2 stored on capacitors C1 and C2, respectively ii.The potential differences V1 and V2 across the capacitors C1 and C2, respectively Calculate the total energy dissipated in resistor R during the time capacitor C1 discharges. Write, but do NOT solve, a differential equation that could be used to determine the time constant associated with the discharge of C1. Calculate the time constant associated with the discharge of C1.",
