    "description": "Ciprofloxacin is given as an antibiotic to healthy livestock to promote efficient weight gain. Strains of the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni naturally colonize the digestive tracts of livestock, and the C. jejuni can be transferred to people through the handling and consumption of contaminated meat. People infected with C. jejuni also are treated with ciprofloxacin.",
