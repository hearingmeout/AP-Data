    "description": "In an investigation of interspecies competition, researchers grew the unicellular protozoan Paramecium aurelia in a 5 mL culture and Paramecium caudatum in a separate 5 mL culture. P. aurelia and P. caudatum were grown together in a third 5 mL culture. Each day a small sample of each culture was removed so the total number of individuals could be estimated, and the remainder of the population was transferred to fresh growth medium. The experimental results are represented in the graphs below.",
