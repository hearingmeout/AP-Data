    "description": "In an investigation of interspecies competition, researchers grew the unicellular protozoan Paramecium aurelia in a 5 mL culture and Paramecium caudatum in a separate 5 mL culture. P. aurelia and P. caudatum were grown together in a third 5 mL culture. Each day a small sample of each culture was removed so the total number of individuals could be estimated, and the remainder of the population was transferred to fresh growth medium. The experimental results are represented in the graphs below.",
    "question": "If the mixed populations were cultured for an additional 25 days, which of the following predictions would be consistent with the data?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Both populations would stabilize at a small size.",

        "label": "Both populations would be eliminated from the culture.",

        "label": "One population would stabilize at a large size, and the other population would be eliminated from the culture.",

    "answer": "One population would stabilize at a large size, and the other population would be eliminated from the culture."
