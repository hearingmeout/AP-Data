    "description": "In response to elevated blood glucose levels, beta (β) cells in the pancreas release insulin, a regulatory hormone. Insulin signals body cells to take up glucose from the blood, which returns blood glucose levels back to normal. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that destroys β-cells, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels.\n\nResearchers have proposed that diabetes could be treated by implanting human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that have been induced to develop into β-cells (hESC-β). To test the proposed treatment, the researchers set up two groups of genetically identical mice and implanted the mice from one group with hESC-β cells. Several weeks after the hESC-β implant, both groups of mice were given a drug (STZ) that selectively destroys the naturally occurring mouse β-cells but does not affect the implanted hESC-β cells. Figure 1 shows a comparison of average blood glucose levels in both groups of mice.\n\nFigure 1. Average blood glucose levels in mice after STZ treatment. Error bars indicate standard deviation.\n\nIn a continuation of the experiment, the researchers removed the hESC-β implant from one of the mice 16 weeks after STZ treatment. Figure 2 shows the blood glucose levels in the mouse over the duration of the experiment.\n\nFigure 2. Blood glucose levels for an individual mouse over the duration of the experiment.",
    "question": "In contrast to type 1 diabetes, where there is no insulin production, type 2 diabetes is characterized by a failure of body cells to respond normally to insulin. Based on the results of the experiment, which of the following best predicts the effectiveness of using hESC-β implantation to treat type 2 diabetes?",
