    "description": "LAC OPERON STRUCTURE\n\nThe functions of the loci of the lac operon shown in the diagram are described in the table below.\n\nThe diagram above represents a segment of the E. coli chromosome that contains the lacI gene and part of the lac operon, a coordinately regulated set of genes that are required for the metabolism of lactose. The presence of lactose, which causes the repressor to be released from the operator, results in increased transcription of the lac operon.",
