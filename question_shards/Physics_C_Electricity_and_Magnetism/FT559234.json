    "description": "The TAS2R38 gene encodes a receptor protein that influences the ability to taste bitterness. The gene has two alleles: a dominant, wild-type allele that enables an individual (taster) to taste bitterness and a recessive, mutant allele that interferes with the ability of an individual (nontaster) to taste bitterness. Three single nucleotide mutations in the coding region of the TAS2R38 gene are associated with the nontaster allele. The nucleotides present at the three positions are shown in the table below.\n\nA cladogram representing the evolutionary relatedness of selected primates is shown below.",
    "question": "The TAS2R38 receptor protein has been detected on the surface of cells from individuals who are homozygous for the nontaster allele of the TAS2R38 gene. Which of the following is the most likely effect of the mutations associated with the nontaster allele on TAS2R38 gene expression?",
