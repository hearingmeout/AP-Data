    "description": "In the American Southwest, annually emerging cicadas are dependent upon the cottonwood trees in the floodplain. Adult male cicadas perch in the cottonwood trees and chirp to attract females. Females lay their eggs in the branches of the cottonwoods, and, upon hatching, the cicada nymphs drop to the ground, burrow into the soil, feed on the tree roots, and later emerge as adults. Other organisms in the floodplain community prey on the cicadas, as shown in the food web.\n\nFigure 1. Food web in floodplain community\n\nHuman activity has caused a decrease in the amount of flooding and an increase in the incidence of wildfires in the floodplain. In an investigation into the recent changes in the floodplain ecosystem, researchers monitored the soil temperature, amount of cottonwood ground coverage (i.e., area of the ground that is shaded by leaves), and cicada emergence for a period from mid-June until late July. The results of the investigation are represented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\n\nTo assess the impact of wildfires on soil temperature and cicada emergence, the researchers compared mean emergence dates for two natural sites where portions had been affected by wildfire. In addition, cicada emergence was monitored at an experimental site where the soil temperature was experimentally maintained. The data are shown in the table.\n\nMEAN CICADA EMERGENCE DATES AT SITES AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES OR WITH EXPERIMENTALLY CONTROLLED SOIL TEMPERATURE",
