    "description": "Environmental mutagens can affect DNA in cells. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a mutagen that is commonly found in urban air pollution. Researchers claim that the effect of UVA radiation (UVA), another known mutagen, is amplified by the presence of BaP. To test their claim, the researchers exposed cultured eukaryotic cells to either BaP, UVA radiation, or both mutagens. The researchers then determined the percent of chromosomal DNA that contained damage in the form of double-strand breaks. The results are shown in the table.",
    "question": "Using the results from all treatments, describe the effect of BaP alone and UVA alone compared with the effect of the combined treatment of BaP and UVA on DNA.",
