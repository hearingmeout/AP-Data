    "description": "Figure 1 shows the events during and immediately following fertilization of a sea urchin egg. Sexual reproduction relies on the successful fusion of only one sperm with one egg (time 1) during fertilization. In sea urchins, a diploid organism, several events prevent additional sperm from fertilizing the egg. One of the first events following fertilization is the fusion of secretory vesicles called cortical granules with the egg plasma membrane (time 2). The cortical granules release their contents, a mixture of polysaccharides and proteins, into the perivitelline space. Subsequent to this, water moves into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and physically separate the fertilization envelope from the egg plasma membrane (time 3). The fertilization envelope prevents fusion of more than one sperm with the egg",
    "question": "Describe how the release of the contents of the cortical granules into the perivitelline space results in the movement of water and causes the subsequent expansion of the perivitelline space.",
