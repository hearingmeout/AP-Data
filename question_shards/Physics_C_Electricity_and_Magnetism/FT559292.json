    "description": "Figure 1. MDM2 and p53 signaling in response to DNA damage controls cell cycle progression.\n\nThe p53 and MDM2 proteins are involved in the DNA damage response pathway (Figure 1). In the absence of DNA damage, MDM2 mediates the degradation of p53. In the presence of DNA damage, p53 is not broken down and forms active tetramers that stimulate the expression of genes that block cell cycle progression.\n\nRed blood cells are produced by the division and differentiation of multipotent stem cells. Researchers have observed that mice with a partial loss-of-function mutation in the MDM2 gene have a lower concentration of red blood cells in the blood than do mice that express the wild-type MDM2 allele.",
