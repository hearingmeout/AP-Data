    "question": "Lobe-finned fishes were present in the oceans of the world approximately 400 million years ago. The first tetrapods (vertebrates that had limbs and could move on land) date to about 365 million years ago. One hypothesis states that early tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. Which of the following is the best plan for testing the hypothesis?",
