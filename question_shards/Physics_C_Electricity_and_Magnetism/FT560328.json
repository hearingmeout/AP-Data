    "description": "Prairie dogs are small mammals that live in large colonies in burrows in the ground. Prairie dogs that are near their own relatives when a predator approaches are much more likely to issue a warning bark than those that are near unrelated prairie dogs. The prairie dogs that hear a warning bark are more likely to hide in their burrows than to remain above ground. However, the prairie dog that gives the warning bark is putting itself at increased risk of being identified and killed by the predator.",
    "question": "Which of the following presents the most likely evolutionary explanation for the behaviors described?",
