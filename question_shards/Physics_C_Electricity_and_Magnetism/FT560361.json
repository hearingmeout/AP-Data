    "description": "The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a small fish found in both marine and freshwater environments. Marine stickleback populations consist mostly of individuals with pronounced pelvic spines, as shown in Figure 1. Individuals in freshwater stickleback populations, on the other hand, typically have reduced pelvic spines, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nAs represented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the phenotypic difference between marine and freshwater sticklebacks involves Pitx1, a gene that influences the formation of the jaw, pituitary gland, and pelvic spine. Enhancer sequences upstream of the Pitx1 genetic locus regulate expression of the Pitx1 gene at the appropriate times and in the appropriate tissues during development. Previous studies have found that a mutation in the hindlimb enhancer interferes with the formation of a pronounced pelvic spine.",
    "question": "In sticklebacks, which of the following is most likely to occur if the jaw enhancer is disabled instead of the hindlimb enhancer?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The jaw and a pronounced pelvic spine develop normally because the Pitx1 gene is expressed in both developing tissues.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Neither the jaw nor a pronounced pelvic spine develop normally because there is no Pitx1 gene expression in either developing tissue.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The jaw develops normally, but a pronounced pelvic spine does not develop because the Pitx1 gene is expressed in the developing jaw but not in the developing pelvis.",

      {
        "label": "The jaw does not develop normally, but a pronounced pelvic spine does develop because the Pitx1 gene is expressed in the developing pelvis but not in the developing jaw.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The jaw does not develop normally, but a pronounced pelvic spine does develop because the Pitx1 gene is expressed in the developing pelvis but not in the developing jaw."
