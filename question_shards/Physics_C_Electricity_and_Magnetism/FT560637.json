    "description": "The brain coordinates the circulatory and respiratory systems of the human body. The control of breathing, for example, involves neural pathways among the structures represented in the figure above. One important stimulus in the control of breathing is an increase in blood CO2 concentration, which is detected as a decrease in blood pH.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the physiological response to an overall increase in cellular respiration in the body?",
