    "description": "Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an organic molecule necessary for the health of plants and animals. The majority of animals, including most mammals, synthesize ascorbic acid from organic precursors, but some primates are unable to synthesize ascorbic acid and must instead acquire it from dietary sources, such as certain fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes a required step in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid. Most mammals carry a functional copy of the GULO gene, but some primates carry only a GULO pseudogene, which is a nonfunctional variant.\n\nA comparison of GULO genes and GULO pseudogenes from different animals can provide insight into the evolutionary relatedness of the animals. In Table I, selected members of some mammalian groups are listed, along with an indication of their ability to synthesize ascorbic acid. Table II shows an alignment of amino acid coding sequences from homologous regions of the GULO genes and GULO pseudogenes of the organisms listed in Table I. Figure 1 represents the universal genetic code.",
    "question": "Lemurs are primates that live on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa. Lemurs have a functional GULO gene and are able to produce ascorbic acid. However, primates that live in other places (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans) have a GULO pseudogene and are unable to produce ascorbic acid. Which of the following best explains the genetic variation among primate species?",
