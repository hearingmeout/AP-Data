    "description": "Iron is an essential nutrient that is acquired by organisms from the environment. When intracellular levels of iron are relatively high, living cells synthesize an iron-storage protein called ferritin.\n\nThe induction of ferritin synthesis by iron was investigated in rats. Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment in which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and actinomycin D, a drug that inhibits transcription.\n\nFigure 2 shows the results of an experiment in which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and cycloheximide, a drug that inhibits translation.",
    "question": "In individuals with iron-rich diets, intracellular levels of iron are higher than in individuals with iron-poor diets. Which of the following best explains how organisms regulate ferritin protein levels in response to available iron?",
