    "description": "Iron is an essential nutrient that is acquired by organisms from the environment. When intracellular levels of iron are relatively high, living cells synthesize an iron-storage protein called ferritin.\n\nThe induction of ferritin synthesis by iron was investigated in rats. Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment in which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and actinomycin D, a drug that inhibits transcription.\n\nFigure 2 shows the results of an experiment in which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and cycloheximide, a drug that inhibits translation.",
    "question": "The gene sequences responsible for the iron ­mediated changes in ferritin protein levels are highly conserved and are called iron response elements (IREs). IREs have been observed in a number of genes involved in iron transport and metabolism. The IRE sequences found in the ferritin gene are found in all multicellular organisms, whereas other nonferritin IRE sequences are found only in certain vertebrate organisms. Which of the following is the best explanation for the observations?",
