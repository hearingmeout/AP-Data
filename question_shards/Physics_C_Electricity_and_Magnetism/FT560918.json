    "description": "Iron is an essential nutrient that is acquired by organisms from the environment. When intracellular levels of iron are relatively high, living cells synthesize an iron-storage protein called ferritin.\n\nThe induction of ferritin synthesis by iron was investigated in rats. Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment in which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and actinomycin D, a drug that inhibits transcription.\n\nFigure 2 shows the results of an experiment in which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and cycloheximide, a drug that inhibits translation.",
    "question": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an iron storage disease that results in reduced uptake of iron into cells. Based on the data, which of the following is the most likely effect of HHC on ferritin protein levels?",
