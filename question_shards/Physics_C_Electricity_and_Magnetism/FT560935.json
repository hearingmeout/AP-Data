    "description": "Malaria is caused by several different species of Plasmodium, a protozoan parasite. Plasmodium resistance to the common drugs used to treat malaria has increased in recent years.",
    "question": "In a scientific study, Plasmodium samples were analyzed in blood drawn from a large number of infected patients before drug treatment and subsequently from the subset of infected patients with drug-resistant Plasmodium. DNA sequences of four different Plasmodium genes thought to be involved in resistance were compared between samples from patients with drug-sensitive Plasmodium and patients with drug-resistant Plasmodium. Which of the following best supports the hypothesis that preexisting mutations confer drug resistance?",
