Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nTo determine the likelihood that a patient with a bacterial infection who is in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital could be successfully treated with antibiotic therapies, researchers investigated the frequency of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from patients in ICUs in the United States from 1994 to 2000. The data from the study are shown in the table, along with the overall change in the frequency of bacterial resistance in patient samples from 1994 to 2000.",
