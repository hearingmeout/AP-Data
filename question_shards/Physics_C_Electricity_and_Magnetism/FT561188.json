    "description": "Directions: Questions 2 is long free-response questions that requires about 22 minutes to answer and is worth 10 points. Read the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nHuman cells divide every day for normal growth, replacement of cells, and tissue repair. The dividing cells proceed through the three phases of the cell cycle as shown in the figure. When a person experiences a cut, damaged skin cells secrete a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF). Epidermal (skin) cells in the vicinity of the injury possess proteins in their cell membranes called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)",
