Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nHuman cells divide every day for normal growth, replacement of cells, and tissue repair. The dividing cells proceed through the three phases of the cell cycle as shown in the figure. When a person experiences a cut, damaged skin cells secrete a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF). Epidermal (skin) cells in the vicinity of the injury possess proteins in their cell membranes called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)",
    "question": "Cancer can result from disruptions in cell cycle control. Mutations that increase the production of EGFR have been associated with skin cancer of the head and neck. Describe how a mutation outside of the coding region of a gene that encodes EGFR could lead to the overproduction of EGFR protein in a skin cell.",
