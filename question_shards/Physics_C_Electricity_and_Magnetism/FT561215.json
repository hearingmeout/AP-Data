    "description": "Directions: Questions 3 is a short free-response questions that requires about 6 minutes to answer. The question is worth 4 points. Read the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nThirty corn seedlings of equal size were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. At the beginning of the experiment, the plants in group I were dried and the mass was determined. The plants in group II were maintained in light for a week. The plants in group III were maintained in the dark for a week. All conditions, other than light, were the same for groups II and III. At the end of the week, the plants in groups II and III were dried and the mass was determined. The experimental results are provided in the table.",
    "question": "To explain the decrease in mass of the dark-grown plants, identify the overall chemical reaction that is occurring in the plant cells and connect it to the cellular process underlying the decrease in mass.",
