    "description": "Directions: Questions 4 is a short free-response questions that requires about 6 minutes to answer. The question is worth 4 points. Read the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nA scientist studying the effect of a stimulus on a motor neuron observed that the permeability of the plasma membrane of the neuron changes during an action potential. The curves in Figure 1 represent the changes in permeability of the membrane to sodium ions (Na+) and potassium ions (K+)during the action potential. The graph in Figure 2 represents the changes in membrane potential during an action potential.",
