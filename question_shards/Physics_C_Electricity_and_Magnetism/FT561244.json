    "description": "Directions: Questions 5 is a short free-response questions that requires about 6 minutes to answer. The question is worth 4 points. Read the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nMany aquatic animals can hold their breath and dive underwater for long periods of time. During long dives, lactic acid builds up in tissues of the organism. The graph above shows blood lactate levels following dives of different duration for three species. Lactate is produced when lactic acid is dissolved in the blood and becomes ionized.",
    "question": "Describe the most likely shape of the curve if blood oxygen levels of Weddell seals were plotted rather than blood lactate levels. Include in your description the likely shape of the curve between 0 and 20 minutes and the shape of the curve after 20 minutes.",
