    "description": "Directions: Questions 6 is a short free-response questions that requires about 6 minutes to answer. The question is worth 3 points. Read the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nIn an experiment investigating the mechanism of protein secretion, researchers tracked the movement of radioactively labeled polypeptides in pancreatic cells. At various times after the labeling, samples of the cells were observed using an electron microscope to determine the location of the radioactively labeled polypeptides. Figure 1 summarizes the results at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes. The dark dots in the figure represent the radioactively labeled polypeptides.",
