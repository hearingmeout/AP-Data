    "description": "Directions: This short free-response question requires about 6 minutes to answer. The question is worth 3 points. Read the question carefully and completely. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable.\n\nThe graph above shows the initial rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at different substrate concentrations in the presence of a constant concentration of the enzyme.",
