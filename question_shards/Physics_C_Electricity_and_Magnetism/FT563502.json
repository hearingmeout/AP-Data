    "description": "Directions: Each group of questions below concerns an experimental or laboratory situation or data. In each case, first study the description of the situation or data. Then choose the one best answer to each question.\n\nIn the 1940's, Avery MacCleod, and McCarty transformed nonencapsulated bacteria into encapsulated forms by growing the nonencapsulated cells in a culture containing an extract made from dead encapsulated cells. The transformed cells produced colonies of encapsulated bacteria. Three different procedures and their results are outlined below.\n\nProcedure I:\n\nExtract made from dead encapsulated cells added to culture medium.\n\nNonencapsulated bacteria added to culture medium.\n\nResults: Both nonencapsulated and encapsulated bacteria grow.\n\nProcedure II:\n\nExtract made from dead encapsulated cells treated with protein-degrading enzymes before adding extract to culture medium.\n\nNonencapsulated bacteria added to culture medium.\n\nResults: Both nonencapsulated and encapsulated bacteria grow.\n\nProcedure III:\n\nExtract made from dead encapsulated cells treated with DNAse (an enzyme that selectively destroys DNA) before adding extract to culture medium.\n\nNonencapsulated bacteria added to culture medium.\n\nResults: Only nonencapsulated bacteria grow.",
