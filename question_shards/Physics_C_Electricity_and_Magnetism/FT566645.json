    "description": "Plants lose water from their above ground surfaces in the process of transpiration. Most of this water is lost form stomata, microscopic openings in the leaves. Excess water loss can have a negative effect on the growth, development, and reproduction of a plant. Severe water loss can be fatal. Environmental factors have a major impact on the rate of plant transpiration.",
    "question": "Using the data below and the axes provided, draw a graph showing the effect of temperature change on the rate of transpiration. Explain the shape of the curve from 23 degrees to 28 degrees.",
