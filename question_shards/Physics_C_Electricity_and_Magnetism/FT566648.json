    "description": "Plants lose water from their above ground surfaces in the process of transpiration. Most of this water is lost form stomata, microscopic openings in the leaves. Excess water loss can have a negative effect on the growth, development, and reproduction of a plant. Severe water loss can be fatal. Environmental factors have a major impact on the rate of plant transpiration.",
    "question": "The data below show the density of stomata on the leaf surfaces of three different species of plants. Describe the environments in which each plant most likely evolved. Justify your descriptions.\n\nGraph for part (a) showing the effect of temperature on the rate of transpiration.\n\nGraph for part (b) showing the predicted effect of humidity on the rate of transpiration.",
