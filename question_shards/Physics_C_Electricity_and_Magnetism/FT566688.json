    "description": "In a study of bacterial communities, researchers investigated interactions among naturally occurring strains of Vibrio bacteria. The researchers found that some Vibrio bacteria secrete antimicrobial substances that inhibit the growth and reproduction of other bacteria (antagonism). The researchers also found that some strains of Vibrio bacteria produce no antimicrobial substances themselves but instead live in close proximity to other bacteria that produce antimicrobial substances to which they are not susceptible (cooperation).\n\nBy testing approximately 35,000 pairs of naturally occurring strains of Vibrio bacteria, the researchers identified 830 antagonistic interactions among genetically related Vibrio strains. The graph represents the probability of antagonism between any two given strains of Vibrio bacteria as a function of genetic relatedness (genetic distance). The greater the genetic distance, the less related are any two bacterial strains.",
