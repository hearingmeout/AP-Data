    "description": "A student conducted an experiment to determine the molar concentration of solutes in chicken eggs. Eggs were soaked in vinegar to remove the shells. The eggs were then placed in sucrose solutions of different concentrations. The data are shown in the table below.",
    "question": "Using the most appropriate data, construct a labeled graph on the axes provided below to best illustrate water movement into and out of the egg. Explain why there is a difference in percent of mass change of the eggs in the different sucrose solutions.",
