    "description": "A student conducted an experiment to determine the molar concentration of solutes in chicken eggs. Eggs were soaked in vinegar to remove the shells. The eggs were then placed in sucrose solutions of different concentrations. The data are shown in the table below.",
    "question": "Movement of water and nutrients is critical for the survival of plants. Using the concept of water potential, explain the role of positive and negative pressure in the transport of water and nutrients throughout a vascular plant.",
