    "description": "Plants lose water from their above ground surfaces in the process of transpiration. Most of this water is lost from stomata, microscopic openings in the leaves. Excess water loss can have a negative effect on the growth, development, and reproduction of a plant. Severe water loss can be fatal. Environmental factors have a major impact on the rate of plant transpiration.",
    "question": "Humidity is another environmental factor that affects transpiration rate. Using the axes provided, draw a curve that illustrates what you predict would be the rate of transpiration with increasing humidity and constant temperature. Justify the shape of the curve based on your prediction.",
