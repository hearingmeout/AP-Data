    "description": "In fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), straight wing shape is dominant to curly wing shape. A particular population of fruit flies is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the alleles for wing shape.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation, given below, is useful in understanding population genetics:\n\np2 + 2pq + q2 = 1",
    "question": "Explain what the terms ( p2 , 2pq, and q2 ) represent in the population of fruit flies.",
