    "question": "In eukaryotic cells, ribosomes are found both free in the cytosol and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Proteins produced on the attached ribosomes are delivered to the ER, while proteins produced on free ribosomes are delivered to the cytosol. Briefly explain in one or two sentences the two processes in terms of the following: • ONE ultimate destination of a protein produced on an attached ribosome, and ONE general function of the protein (You do not need to identify the specific protein.) • ONE ultimate destination of a protein produced on a free ribosome, and ONE general function of the protein (You do not need to identify the specific protein.)",
