    "question": "An offshore wind farm project using turbines to generate electricity is to be built along the Atlantic coast of the United States. It will be located about 13 km from the coast in water with an average depth of 10 m \n\nDescribe one environmental benefit associated with an offshore wind project. \n\nIdentify and describe one potential economic effect of an offshore wind project. \n\nDescribe one additional way, other than wind power, that oceans can provide renewable energy for the generation of electricity \n\nThe project will consist of 200 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 4 megawatts (MW). Each turbine costs $1.2 million to build. Electrical demand in the area to be served by the project is expected to be 2.0 × 106 MWh per year. \n\nCalculate how much electricity (in MWh) the wind project needs to generate per year in order to provide 80% of the annual electrical demand in the service area. Show all work. \n\nCustomers in the service area pay $0.20/kWh for electricity. Calculate how much revenue will be produced if the wind turbines provide 80% of the annual electrical demand in the service area. Show all work. \n\nAssuming all turbines are operating, calculate how many hours the wind turbines must operate to provide 80% of the annual electrical demand in the service area. Show all work.",
