    "description": "The following questions are based on the following excerpt from a major Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone…”\n\n…We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of “separate but equal” has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently inequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs…are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.”",
