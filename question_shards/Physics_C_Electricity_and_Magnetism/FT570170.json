    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.Sleep researchers know that some people are early birds (E), preferring to go to bed by 10 P.M. and arise by 7 A.M., while others are night owls (N), preferring to go to bed after 11 P.M. and arise after 8 A.M. A study was done to compare dream recall for early birds and night owls. One hundred people of each of the two types were selected at random and asked to record their dreams for one week. Some of the results are presented below.The researchers believe that night owls may have better dream recall than do early birds. One parameter of interest to the researchers is the mean number of dreams recalled per week with µE representing this mean for early birds and µN representing this mean for night owls. The appropriate hypotheses would then be H0: µE - µN = 0 and Ha: µE - µN < 0. State two other pairs of hypotheses that might be used to test the researchers’ belief. Be sure to define the parameter of interest in each case. Use the data provided to carry out a test of the hypotheses about the mean number of dreams recalled per week given in the statement of part (a). Do the data support the researchers’ belief ?",
