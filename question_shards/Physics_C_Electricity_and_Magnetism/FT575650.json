    "question": "The graph above shows the distribution of beak depth in a finch population that had been living on an island under conditions of normal rainfall. During a subsequent drought, the small seeds normally eaten by the finches were less available. Most of the available seeds were large seeds that could be eaten most easily by finches with deep beaks. Which of the following graphs best predicts the distribution of beak depth in the finch population after several years of drought?",
