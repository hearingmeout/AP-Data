    "description": "Researchers investigated the habitat preferences of two species of garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis and Thamnophis atratus. To create a choice chamber, the researchers built a meshed enclosure and positioned one end of the enclosure at the edge of a small pond. Zone I of the enclosure was located in the water, whereas zone IV of the enclosure was located 2–3 meters away from the water, as represented in the figure below. Snakes inside the enclosure were able to move freely between zones.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers introduced a single snake into zone IV of the enclosure at 7:00 A.M. The researchers recorded the location of the snake at six time points throughout the day. In a related experiment, the researchers introduced two snakes, one of each species, into the enclosure at the same time and observed the location of each of the two snakes at the same six time points as before. The researchers repeated both the one-snake and two-snake experiments using different individual snakes of each species. The results are presented in the table.",
    "question": "Both species of garter snakes prey on the California newt, Taricha torosa, a small amphibian that produces a potent neurotoxin (TTX) in its skin. However, neither species of garter snake is affected by TTX. The resistance to TTX is associated with mutations in the SCN4A gene. Which of the following best supports a claim that TTX resistance arose independently in T. atratus and T. sirtalis ?",
