    "question": "Both species of garter snakes prey on the California newt, Taricha torosa, a small amphibian that produces a potent neurotoxin (TTX) in its skin. However, neither species of garter snake is affected by TTX. The resistance to TTX is associated with mutations in the SCN4A gene. Which of the following best supports a claim that TTX resistance arose independently in T. atratus and T. sirtalis ?",
