    "description": "Stickleback fish are found in both marine and freshwater habitats. The marine fish have no scales but have hardened, armorlike plates along their sides. The plates are thought to protect sticklebacks from certain predators.\n\nIn the late 1980s, sticklebacks from a marine population colonized Loberg Lake, a freshwater lake in Alaska. Starting in 1990, researchers sampled fish from the lake every four years and recorded the armor-plate phenotypes of the male sticklebacks in each sample. The armor-plate phenotypes were categorized as either complete (plates extending from head to tail), partial (plates extending from head to abdomen), or low (a few plates near the head only). The results are shown in the table below.\n\nARMOR-PLATE VARIATION IN THE STICKLEBACK POPULATION OF LOBERG LAKE\n\nPercent of Males in the Sample with Each Armor-Plate Phenotype\n\nYear\n Low\n Partial\n Complete\n\n1990\n 1%\n 2%\n 97%\n\n1994\n 45%\n 14%\n 41%\n\n1998\n 58%\n 16%\n 26%\n\n2002\n 76%\n 15%\n 9%\n\n2006\n 90%\n 6%\n 4%",
    "question": "Intact cells of two unknown cell types were placed into solutions with different concentrations of NaCl. Type I cells swelled and burst in the solution with the lowest concentration of NaCl. Type II cells swelled but did not burst in the solution with the lowest concentration of NaCl.\nWhich of the following descriptions of cell type I and cell type II are most consistent with the data?",
