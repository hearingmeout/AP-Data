The figure presents a cell membrane with an embedded structure that looks like a circle from which one pie-shaped wedge is missing. The missing wedge is on the face of the circle that is outside the cell. Two different shapes are shown outside the cell, and a portion of each shape is complementary in shape to the missing wedge of the circle. An arrow points from each shape to the missing wedge of the circle. Inside the cell, an arrow points from the embedded circle to a large dot, and another arrow points from the dot to a small square.",

The figure presents a cell membrane with an embedded structure that looks like a circle from which one pie-shaped wedge is missing. The missing wedge is on the face of the circle that is outside the cell. A single wedge that is complementary in shape to the missing wedge of the circle is shown outside the cell, close to the missing wedge of the circle. Inside the cell, two arrows point from the embedded circle, one to a large dot, and the other to a small square. Arrows then point from both the large dot and the small square to a single rectangle.",
