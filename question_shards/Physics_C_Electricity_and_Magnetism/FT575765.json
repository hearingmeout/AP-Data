    "description": "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder caused by an autosomal recessive allele of the HEXA gene. Affected individuals exhibit severe neurological symptoms and do not survive to reproductive age. Individuals who inherit one copy of the allele (Tay-Sachs carriers) typically show no symptoms of the disorder. The frequencies of Tay-Sachs carriers in the general population of North America and in three different subpopulations are presented in the table.",
