    "description": "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder caused by an autosomal recessive allele of the HEXA gene. Affected individuals exhibit severe neurological symptoms and do not survive to reproductive age. Individuals who inherit one copy of the allele (Tay-Sachs carriers) typically show no symptoms of the disorder. The frequencies of Tay-Sachs carriers in the general population of North America and in three different subpopulations are presented in the table.",
    "question": "A researcher claims that Tay-Sachs carriers are protected against the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB). Which of the following observations about the annual incidence of tuberculosis in subpopulation II could best be used to support the researcher’s claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The incidence of TB in subpopulation II is roughly equal to the incidence of TB in the general population.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The incidence of TB in subpopulation II is greater than the incidence of TB in the general population.",
        "image": null
