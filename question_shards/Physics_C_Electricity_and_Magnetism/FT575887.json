    "description": "Excess intracellular iron is toxic to cells (iron-induced toxicity). Ferritin is an intracellular iron storage protein that binds excess iron. The presence of ferritin can protect cells from iron-induced toxicity.\n\nIn an experiment to investigate the effects of dietary iron intake on ferritin synthesis, rats were given food containing different amounts of iron. Subsequently, the levels of ferritin protein in the liver were measured. The results are shown in Figure 1.\n\nBased on these and other data, researchers have developed the following model demonstrating how ferritin synthesis is regulated by iron. When iron levels are low, a repressor of translation, iron response protein (IRP), binds to an iron response element (IRE), which is a stem-loop structure near the 5¢ end of ferritin mRNA. When iron levels are high, intracellular iron binds to the IRP, and the iron-IRP complex dissociates from the IRE, permitting ribosomes to proceed with the translation of ferritin mRNA. Figure 2 represents the model of the regulation of ferritin mRNA translation by iron.\n\nFigure 2. Model of regulation of ferritin synthesis by iron",
    "question": "After a search of nucleotide sequence databases, researchers identified an IRE in the 5¢ untranslated region of a gene encoding aconitase, an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle. Which of the following pieces of experimental evidence best supports the claim that the synthesis of aconitase is controlled by a mechanism similar to ferritin regulation?",
