    "question": "After a search of nucleotide sequence databases, researchers identified an IRE in the 5¢ untranslated region of a gene encoding aconitase, an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle. Which of the following pieces of experimental evidence best supports the claim that the synthesis of aconitase is controlled by a mechanism similar to ferritin regulation?",
