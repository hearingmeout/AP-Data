    "question": "The California grunion (Leuresthes tenuis) is a small marine fish that lives in shallow waters near the ocean shore. Grunions swim as far onto the beach as possible to mate and lay their eggs (spawn). A researcher proposes that the spawning behavior takes place when the nighttime tides are highest during the month. Which of the following pieces of evidence would best support the researcher’s claim?",
