    "description": "To investigate the influence of predation risk on ray behavior, a student observed and counted the large marine animals swimming in a shallow, nearshore section of a coral reef ecosystem. The time of each observation was recorded relative to the time of high tide. The student noted that at low tide, when the water level is low, many of the large animals are forced out of the study area and into the deeper waters of the outer reef. During high tides, when the water level is high, the large animals are able to reenter the study area.\n\nOver a three-day period, the student observed a total of 604 individual rays belonging to three species: cowtail rays, giant shovelnose rays, and black stingrays. For each ray that was sighted, its body length was estimated and its status as either alone (ungrouped) or found with other rays (grouped) was noted. Occasionally, rays were observed sifting through the sandy substrate of the study area to capture food items such as molluscs and crustaceans. In one instance, an injured ray with bite marks that were likely sustained in a shark attack was sighted. In addition to the rays, the student observed lemon sharks (n = 46) and blacktip reef sharks (n = 39). The results of the study are presented in the figures below.\n\nFigure 1.
