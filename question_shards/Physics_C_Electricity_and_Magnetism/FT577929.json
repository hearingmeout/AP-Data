    "description": "The figure above shows a thin, square, nonconducting sheet of positive charge uniformly distributed over its area. The length of each side of the sheet is a. Point C is at the center of the sheet. Point X is a distance d above the center of the sheet, and point Y is a distance 2d above the center of the sheet. Assume a >> d. The effect of gravity is negligible.",
    "question": "If the magnitude of the electric field at point X is E, what is the magnitude of the electric field at point Y?",
