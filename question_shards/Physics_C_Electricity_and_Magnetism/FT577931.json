    "question": "Capacitors C1 and C2 are connected as shown in the circuit above. The capacitance of C1 is C, and the capacitance of C2 is C/3 . The equivalent capacitance between points A and B is CEQ. A dielectric is inserted into capacitor C2 , and the equivalent capacitance between points A and B is now 2CEQ . What is the value of the dielectric constant for this dielectric?",
