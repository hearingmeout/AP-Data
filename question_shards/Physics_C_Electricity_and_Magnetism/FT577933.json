    "question": "A square coil with sides of length 1.0 cm is moved through a region of uniform magnetic field at a constant speed, as shown in the figure above. Which of the following graphs best shows the current I in the coil as a function of the position x of the right edge as the coil moves through the magnetic field, where counterclockwise current is positive?",

The horizontal axis is labeled “x, in centimeters,” and the numbers 1 and 3 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “I, in amperes,” and no numbers are indicated along the axis. The graph consists of four connected straight line segments. The first line segment begins at a point below the origin on the vertical axis, and extends upward and to the right until it reaches 1 on the x axis. The second line segment extends horizontally along the x axis, until it reaches 3. The third line segment extends vertically upward by the same distance as the graph began below the origin. The fourth line segment extends downward and to the right until it ends at 4 on the x axis.",
