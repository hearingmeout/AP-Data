    "question": "The y-component of the magnetic field B is given as a function of time t by the equation By = -α + βt, where α = 4.0 T and β = 3.0 T/s. A coil of wire with an area of 2.0 m2 and a resistance of 6.0 Ω is placed in this field, parallel to the xz-plane at y= 2.0 cm. The current in the coil at time t = 1.2 s is most nearly",
