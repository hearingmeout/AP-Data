    "question": "An inductor with inductance L = 0.30 H is connected in series with a resistor and both are connected to a power supply, as shown above. The power supply generates a current I that is given as a function of time t by the equation I = I0 (1-t/k), where I0 = 4.0 A and k = 2.0 s . What is the magnitude of the potential difference across the inductor induced by the changing current?",
