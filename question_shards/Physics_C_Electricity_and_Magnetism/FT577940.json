    "description": "The figure above shows two charged spherical conductors, X and Y, which are equal in size. When each conductor is isolated and surrounded by a closed cubical surface, the total electric flux through the surfaces is +Φ0 for conductor X and − Φ40 for conductor Y.",
    "question": "After being brought into contact with conductor X, conductor Y is moved a very large distance away from conductor X. What is the total electric flux through a closed cubical surface surrounding conductor X, as shown above?",
