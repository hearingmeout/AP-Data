    "description": "The figure above shows two charged spherical conductors, X and Y, which are equal in size. When each conductor is isolated and surrounded by a closed cubical surface, the total electric flux through the surfaces is +Φ0 for conductor X and − Φ40 for conductor Y.",
    "question": "Conductor Y is then moved closer to conductor X until it is just outside a closed cubical surface containing conductor X, as shown in the figure above. How would the total electric flux through the cubical surface change as conductor Y is moving?",
