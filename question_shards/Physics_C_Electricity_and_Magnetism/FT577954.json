    "description": "Three identical spheres are equally spaced from one another. Spheres 1 and 2 have charge +Q, and sphere 3 has a charge of –Q, as shown in the figure above. Five different positions are labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Positions A, B, and C are all the same distance from sphere 3. Positions C, D, and E are all the same distance from sphere 2. All spheres and points lie in the same plane.",
    "question": "At which of the five positions are the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field directed toward the left and the top of the page, respectively?",
