    "question": "A charged capacitor C, resistor R, and switch S are connected in series. Voltmeter V is connected in parallel with the resistor, as shown in the figure above. At time t = 0, the switch is then closed. Which of the following shows the potential difference ΔV reading on the voltmeter as a function of time t after the switch is closed?",
