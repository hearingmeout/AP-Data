    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nJoseph Seamon Cotter's poem \"Prologue to a Supposed Play\" was published in 1898.\n\nPrologue to a Supposed Play\n\nMy worthy hearers, have you come tonight\n\nTo feast on comedy that’s brisk and light,\n\nAnd gladly spend an idle hour or two\n\nLine In viewing pictures that are just like you?\n\n(5)    If this is what you want, just let me say\n\nYou couldn’t turn your heads a better way;\n\nAnd for each cent you gave to enter here\n\nYou should take back a modicum of cheer,\n\nAnd weigh yourselves so well that you will be\n\n(10)   Arrayed against your insufficiency.\n\nBut this is preaching? Well, the comic stage\n\nHas preached through ridicule to every age.\n\nMan scorns his shallow deed and sordid pelf1\n\nWhen he’s employed in laughing at himself.\n\n(15)   So let us preach in every way that can\n\nLift man up to the dignity of man.\n\nNow, don’t be too exact, but let good sense\n\nDecide the point of honest eminence;\n\nAnd bear in mind that what is trite and true,\n\n(20)   If well managed, is worthy through and through.\n\nBut to the play. It comes in five long acts,\n\nIn which the weapons used are naked facts.\n\nThere is no effort made to polish darts\n\nThat find a lodgement in deceitful hearts,\n\n(25)   Nor to put on the rouge an honest mask,\n\nFor that would be, indeed, a fruitless task.\n\nThe characters are plain, as you will see,\n\nAnd richly freighted with humanity;\n\nAnd, by the way, their actions prove in making\n\n(30)   A man of noble parts; the undertaking\n\nIs such that nature seldom deigns to run\n\nThe same material on from sire to son.\n\nThe actors are a queer and jolly set,\n\nWhose fun increases as you fume and fret;\n\n(35)   So, should they hurl at you eccentric airs,\n\nJust dodge as though they struck you unawares,\n\nOr jesting strive to make a pointed hit,\n\nJust hold your peace and let it pass for wit.\n\nNow, my good hearers, hint what I shall say next.\n\n(40)   You want to hear no more? Bring on the play next?\n\nWell, here it is, and if you don’t grow wiser,\n\nCensure yourselves as well as the advisor.\n\n1wealth",
