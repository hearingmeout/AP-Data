    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nPhillis Wheatley's poem \"On Imagination\" was published in 1773. \n\nOn Imagination  \n\nThy various works, imperial queen, we see,\n\nHow bright their forms! how deck’d with pomp by thee!\n\nThy wond’rous acts in beauteous order stand,\n\nAnd all attest how potent is thine hand.\n\n(5)   From Helicon’s1 refulgent heights attend,\n\nYe sacred choir, and my attempts befriend:\n\nTo tell her glories with a faithful tongue,\n\nYe blooming graces,2 triumph in my song.\n\nNow here, now there, the roving Fancy flies,\n\n(10)   Till some lov’d object strikes her wand’ring eyes,\n\nWhose silken fetters all the senses bind,\n\nAnd soft captivity involves the mind.\n\nImagination! who can sing thy force?\n\nOr who describe the swiftness of thy course?\n\n(15)   Soaring through air to find the bright abode,\n\nTh’ empyreal palace of the thund’ring God,\n\nWe on thy pinions3 can surpass the wind,\n\nAnd leave the rolling universe behind:\n\nFrom star to star the mental optics rove,\n\n(20)   Measure the skies, and range the realms above.\n\nThere in one view we grasp the mighty whole,\n\nOr with new worlds amaze th’ unbounded soul.\n\nThough Winter frowns to Fancy’s raptur’d eyes\n\nThe fields may flourish, and gay scenes arise;\n\n(25)   The frozen deeps may break their iron bands,\n\nAnd bid their waters murmur o’er the sands.\n\nFair Flora4 may resume her fragrant reign,\n\nAnd with her flow’ry riches deck the plain;\n\nSylvanus5 may diffuse his honours round,\n\n(30)   And all the forest may with leaves be crown’d:\n\nShow’rs may descend, and dews their gems disclose,\n\nAnd nectar sparkle on the blooming rose.\n\nSuch is thy pow’r, nor are thine orders vain,\n\nO thou the leader of the mental train:\n\n(35)   In full perfection all thy works are wrought,\n\nAnd thine the sceptre o’er the realms of thought.\n\nBefore thy throne the subject-passions bow,\n\nOf subject-passions sov’reign ruler Thou,\n\nAt thy command joy rushes on the heart,\n\n(40)   And through the glowing veins the spirits dart.\n\nFancy might now her silken pinions try\n\nTo rise from earth, and sweep th’ expanse on high;\n\nFrom Tithon’s bed now might Aurora rise,\n\nHer cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,\n\n(45)   While a pure stream of light o’erflows the skies.\n\nThe monarch of the day I might behold,\n\nAnd all the mountains tipt with radiant gold,\n\nBut I reluctant leave the pleasing views,\n\nWhich Fancy dresses to delight the Muse;\n\n(50)   Winter austere forbids me to aspire,\n\nAnd northern tempests damp the rising fire;\n\nThey chill the tides of Fancy’s flowing sea,\n\nCease then, my song, cease the unequal lay.6\n\n1Mount Helicon, the home of the nine Muses\n\n2Greek and Roman goddesses of beauty and charm\n\n3wings\n\n4Roman goddess of flowers\n\n5Roman god of woodlands, fields, and flocks\n\n6song",
