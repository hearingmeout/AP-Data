    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nJohn Donne's poem \"The Dream\" was published in 1633.\n\nThe Dream\n\nImage of her whom I love, more than she,\n\nWhose fair impression in my faithful heart,\n\nMakes me her medal, and makes her love me,\n\nAs kings do coins, to which their stamps impart\n\n(5)    The value: go, and take my heart from hence,\n\nWhich now is grown too great and good for me:\n\nHonours oppress weak spirits, and our sense\n\nStrong objects dull; the more, the less we see.\n\nWhen you are gone, and reason gone with you,\n(10)   \n\nThen fantasy is queen and soul, and all;\n\nShe can present joys meaner1 than you do;\n\nConvenient, and more proportional.\n\nSo, if I dream I have you, I have you,\n\nFor, all our joys are but fantastical.\n\n(15)   And so I ’scape the pain, for pain is true;\n\nAnd sleep which locks up sense, doth lock out all.\n\nAfter a such fruition I shall wake,\n\nAnd, but the waking, nothing shall repent;\n\nAnd shall to love more thankful sonnets make,\n\n(20)   Than if more honour, tears, and pains were spent.\n\nBut dearest heart, and dearer image stay;\n\nAlas, true joys at best are dream enough;\n\nThough you stay here you pass too fast away:\n\nFor even at first life’s taper is a snuff.2\n\n(25)   Filled with her love, may I be rather grown\n\nMad with much heart, than idiot with none.\n\n1more moderate\n\n2candle end; burned-out piece of wick",
