    "question": "In naturally occurring solid surface environments, such as soil, bacteria use this same signaling pathway to initiate formation of biofilms, which are densely populated aggregates of bacteria. In the center of the biofilm, cells are more likely to interact only with cells of the same bacterial strain. At the edges of the biofilm, cells are more likely to encounter cells of a different bacterial strain or species. Identify the most likely type of ecological relationships among cells in the center of the biofilm AND cells at the edges of the biofilm. Provide reasoning to support a researcher’s claim that the bacteria cannot form biofilms at a low population density.",
