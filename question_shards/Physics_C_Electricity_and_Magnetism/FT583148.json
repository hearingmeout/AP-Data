    "description": "TABLE 1. NUCLEOTIDE PRESENT AT 6 DIFFERENT SNP POSITIONS IN INDIVIDUALS FROM 5 DIFFERENT HUMAN POPULATIONS\n\nThe EPAS1 gene in human populations encodes a transcription factor activated in low-oxygen conditions, such as those found in high altitude (mountainous) regions. Researchers collected DNA from several populations of modern humans, including Han, Yoruban, Luhya, and Tibetan. They also collected DNA from the fossils of Denisovans, a prehistoric population. The researchers sequenced the most common EPAS1 allele in each population and determined the specific pattern of variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), at six positions in each population (Table 1).",
