    "description": "Figure 1. Effect of increasing concentrations of atovaquone on the growth of P. falciparum\n\nMalaria is a human disease caused by the eukaryotic parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is essential for the synthesis of pyrimidine bases, including thymine (T), cytosine (C), and uracil (U), in P. falciparum. To synthesize these bases, DHODH requires electrons that are donated by the electron transport chain protein cytochrome b. Atovaquone is a drug that irreversibly binds to cytochrome b and inhibits the growth of P. falciparum (Figure 1).",
    "question": "Based on an analysis of the data, estimate the effective dose of atovaquone that causes a fifty percent reduction in growth of P. falciparum.",
