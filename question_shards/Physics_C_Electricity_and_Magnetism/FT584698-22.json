    "description": "In Paul Laurence Dunbar’s poem “The Mystery,” published in 1896, the speaker contemplates his existence. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Dunbar uses literary elements and techniques to portray the complex nature of the speaker’s existence and his conclusions about it.\n\nThe Mystery\n\nI was not; now I am — a few days hence\n\nI shall not be; I fain would look before\n\nAnd after, but can neither do; some Power\n\nOr lack of power says “no” to all I would.\n\n5I stand upon a wide and sunless plain,\n\nNor chart nor steel to guide my steps aright.\n\nWhene’er, o’ercoming fear, I dare to move,\n\nI grope without direction and by chance.\n\nSome feign to hear a voice and feel a hand\n\n10That draws them ever upward thro’ the gloom.\n\nBut I — I hear no voice and touch no hand,\n\nTho’ oft thro’ silence infinite I list,\n\nAnd strain my hearing to supernal sounds;\n\nTho’ oft thro’ fateful darkness do I reach,\n\n15And stretch my hand to find that other hand.\n\nI question of th’ eternal bending skies\n\nThat seem to neighbor with the novice earth;\n\nBut they roll on, and daily shut their eyes\n\nOn me, as I one day shall do on them,\n\n20And tell me not the secret that I ask.",
