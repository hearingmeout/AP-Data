    "description": "The excerpt is from C. E. Morgan’s novel All the Living, published in 2009. This passage describes a young girl’s experience moving away from her extended family in rural Appalachia. Read the passage carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Morgan uses literary elements and techniques to convey Aloma’s complex responses her changing environment.\n\nShe was sent to the mission school the month\n\nbefore she turned a thankless twelve, not because her\n\naunt and uncle couldn’t handle her any\n\nmore, but because there were nine in the house now — the\n\n(5) adults, their five children, one foster child, and\n\nAloma. Her aunt and uncle had always been fine to\n\nher, they possessed a kind of hollow-headed decency\n\nthat couldn’t be disparaged. When they told her of the\n\nschool, they were gentle as doctors, and their voices\n\n(10) said, This won’t hurt a bit, and in fact, it had not\n\nreally, at least not that Aloma could recall. Only that\n\nfirst night she found that her eyes stung and to make\n\nthem stop she turned facedown into her pillow and let\n\nthem tear with her mouth open ragged against the\n\n(15) cotton ticking, but in the morning her eyes were better\n\nand she did not cry again, at least not over that.\n\nIt was not that her aunt and uncle hadn’t cared for\n\nher — they had never made her feel guilty for their\n\ntaking her in when they had no money — but they’d\n\n(20) cared in a middling, impersonal way that instinctively\n\nreserved their best for their own. During her first year\n\nat the school, they made their small familial efforts,\n\nthey phoned her once a month on Sunday afternoons\n\nand sent little cartooned magazines from their church\n\n(25) about crossing a wide river in a phalanx of other\n\nrefugees or about Ruth and her numerous losses. Until\n\nshe began to play piano, Aloma read these again and\n\nagain, carefully, stacked them in neat piles under her\n\nsteel-framed bed. She wondered what it meant to\n\n(30) uncover a man’s feet, to sleep in his bed, to travel to a\n\nfar country, to see enemies drowned. She wondered\n\nwhat kind of luck was required to be someone other\n\nthan the person you were born to be.\n\nThe school carried her into a deeper cleavage of the\n\n(35) mountains than the one she had known at her uncle’s\n\ntrailer, which jagged out like an aluminum finger\n\nfrom a limestone wall topped by firs, bone out of\n\nbone. There the night carried on and on until ten in\n\nthe morning, then the tip of the finger finally burned\n\n(40) with its first sun. When she arrived at the school,\n\nAloma shared a small concrete room with two other\n\ngirls and here too the mountain walls staggered and\n\nthreated up over them all. The sun did not appear in\n\nthe wound of the holler1 until long past eleven where\n\n(45) it remained until Spar Mountain, like a curtain of\n\nearth, cut the light before it could naturally sputter\n\nout. It was a chasmed world without the twin\n\nceremonies of morning and evening.\n\nAloma lived in this dark place, a dark county in a\n\n(50) dark state, and it pressed on her ceaselessly as a girl\n\nuntil she finally realized in a moment of prescience\n\nthat someday adulthood would come with its great\n\nshuddering release and she would be free. Then she\n\nwould leave and find a riseless place where nothing\n\n(55) impeded the progress of the sun from the moment it\n\nrose in the east until it died out easily, dismissed into\n\nthe west. That was what she wanted. That more than\n\nfamily, that more than friendship, that more than love.\n\nJust the kind of day that couldn’t be recalled into\n\n(60) premature darkness by the land.\n\nThe only thing she remembered fondly from her\n\nyears at her uncle’s trailer was a piano, old with a\n\ntiger-eye top, its weight causing the linoleum floor to\n\nsag. Her aunt played on Sundays after church and the\n\n(65) children were made to sit, the restless grappling mass\n\nof them, and sing along. But the churchy songs soon\n\nbored Aloma, hymns were not enough, they contained\n\nthe sound in a too-small box of predictable chords.\n\nShe wanted to see her aunt’s fingers spider up and\n\n(70) down the length of the keyboard, from the woody\n\nlows to the tiny baby sounds of the upper register. She\n\nalways wanted more than she was given and secretly\n\nwished her aunt’s hands would slip and press two\n\nneighbor keys at once. It was always dissonance that\n\n(75) she liked best.\n\n1hollow; a small valley\n\nExcerpt from All the Living by C. E. Morgan. Copyright ©2009 by C. E. Morgan.
