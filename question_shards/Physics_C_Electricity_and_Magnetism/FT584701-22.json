    "description": "“...the beauty of the world...has two edges, one of laughter,\n\none of anguish, cutting the heart asunder.”\n\n—Virginia Woolf, A Room of One’s Own\n\nWoolf’s statement suggests that literary work achieves its greatest power by blending humor and suffering, laughter and anguish. Either from your own reading or from the list, choose a work of fiction in which humor and suffering interact. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the complex effect of this interaction contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot.\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\n\nAll the King’s Men\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\n\nAnna Karenina\n\nArcadia\n\nAs I Lay Dying\n\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\n\nBroken for You\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nThe Country Wife\n\nEmpire Falls\n\nExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nGulliver’s Travels\n\nThe Inheritance of Loss\n\nInvisible Man\n\nMama Day\n\nMiss Lonelyhearts\n\nOn Beauty\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nPale Fire\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nPygmalion\n\nReservation Blues\n\nRhinoceros\n\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\n\nSent for You\n\nYesterday\n\nSula\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew\n\nTo the Lighthouse\n\nTom Jones\n\nTracks\n\nTwelfth Night\n\nWaiting for Godot\n\nWhite Noise\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nWise Blood\n\nThe World According to Garp",
