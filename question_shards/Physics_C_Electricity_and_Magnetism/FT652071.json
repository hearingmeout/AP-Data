    "question": "This question should take approximately 25 minutes. Read each of the parts carefully. Support your answers with relevant physics principles. The parts within the question may not have equal weight. Write your answers in the parts provided after each part. If you find you are in need of symbolic notation that is too difficult to type, you may identify a non-standard symbol and use that throughout your answer. For example, you may identify “Q” as the measurement for an angle. A large, nonconducting sphere of radius \\(R=10\\ \\)m is fixed in space and carries a spherically symmetrical charge distribution. The sign and density of the charge distribution changes as a function of radius \\(r\\) from the center of the sphere represented by \\(\\rho\\left(r\\right)\\). A hole extends from one side of the sphere, through the sphere’s center, and to the opposite side of the sphere. A small nonconducting ball carries a positive net charge and is placed within the hole. The location of the ball is \\(x\\). The friction between the nonconducting ball and the sphere is negligible, and the ball does not exchange charge with the larger sphere. Gravitational effects are negligible. The graph shows the electric potential \\(V\\left(r\\right)\\) at points in the hole between the center of the sphere at \\(r=0\\ \\)m and at the right end of the sphere at \\(r=10\\ \\)m.",
