It is important that you read each question completely before you begin. In many ways, all organisms in a food web can be said to be solar-powered. The producer level of the food web is responsible for the transformation of the solar energy into a form that can be used by other living organisms. (a) Discuss the role of green plants in transforming the Sun’s energy into a form that can ultimately be used by heterotrophs.",
