It is important that you read each question completely before you begin.\n\nEcological succession describes the pattern of changes in communities over time. The graph below shows changes in plant diversity following the abandonment of an agricultural field in a temperate biome.\n\n(a) Discuss the differences in plant diversity shown in the graph and explain how the changes affect the animal species composition between years 0 and 120.",
