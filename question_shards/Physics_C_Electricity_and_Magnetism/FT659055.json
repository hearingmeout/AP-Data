Populations of a plant that appears similar, with slight differences, have been found in the same mountains at altitudes below 2,300 meters.\n\n(a) Describe TWO kinds of data that could be collected to provide a direct answer to the question, do the populations growing above 2,500 meters and the populations growing below 2,300 meters represent a single species?",
