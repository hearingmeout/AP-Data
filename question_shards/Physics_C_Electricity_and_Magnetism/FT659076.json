Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable. A scientist studying the effect of a stimulus on a motor neuron observed that the permeability of the plasma membrane of the neuron changes during an action potential. The curves in Figure 1 represent the changes in permeability of the membrane to sodium ions (Na+) and potassium ions (K+) during the action potential. The graph in Figure 2 represents the changes in membrane potential during an action potential. (a) Identify ONE difference between the Na+ and K+ permeability curves shown in figure 1.",
