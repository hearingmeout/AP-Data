    "question": "Figure 1. Effect of exercise on blood prolactin levels in adult males. The data represent the means ± 2SEx̄.\n\nResearchers conducted a study to investigate the effect of exercise on the release of prolactin into the blood. The researchers measured the concentration of prolactin in the blood of eight adult males before (T = 0 hour) and after one hour (T = 1 hour) of vigorous exercise. As a control, the researchers measured the concentration of blood prolactin in the same group of individuals at the same times of day one week later, but without having them exercise. The results are shown in Figure 1.\n\n(a) Justify the use of the without-exercise treatment as the control in the study design.",
