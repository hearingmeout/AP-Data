    "question": "A certain species of turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) lays its eggs in nests that are buried in the sand. The turtle then leaves the eggs to develop. A researcher claims that turtle embryos are able to shift within their eggs in response to directional thermal cues in the environment. To test the claim, the researcher incubated turtle eggs in containers and used heating pads to deliver heat either to the top of the container (dorsal heating) or to one side of the container (lateral heating). The position of the lateral heat source was switched from one side to the other on day 15. The researcher recorded the shifts in embryo position relative to the initial embryo position in the egg. The results are shown in Figure 1.\n\n(a) Indicate whether the researcher’s claim that turtle embryos within their eggs respond to thermal cues is supported or not supported. Using the data, justify your response.",
