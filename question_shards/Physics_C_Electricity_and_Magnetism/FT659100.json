    "question": "Figure 1. Effect of karrikins and strigolactones on seed germination in an autotrophic host plant and its obligate parasitic weed Strigolactones and karrikins are structurally similar compounds that can affect seed germination in certain species of plants. However, plants with different life strategies (autotrophic plants or obligate parasitic weeds) germinate in response to the presence of different compounds in the soil. After germination, many species of autotrophic plant release strigolactones from their roots into the soil, which promotes uptake of nutrients. The graphs above represent the results of a laboratory experiment to test the effect of different concentrations of strigolactones or karrikins on the seed germination of an autotrophic host plant and of an obligate parasitic weed. (a) Based on an analysis of the data, describe the effect of karrikins on seed germination in the autotrophic host plants and the obligate parasitic weed plants.",
