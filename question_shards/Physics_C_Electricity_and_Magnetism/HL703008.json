    "description": "The harvesting of livestock for meat consumption affects the planet in various ways. Approximately 25% of the land area on Earth is used for raising livestock. One-third of all water used in meat production goes toward producing beef, and the demand for beef is projected to increase by 95% by 2050. The graph below shows the average meat consumption per capita from 2010 to 2012 and the forecasted meat consumption for 2022 for five different countries.",
    "question": "Which of the following claims is best supported by the data in the graph?",
