Comparison of population size in urban and rural areas from 1960 to 2016 A scientist interested in investigating how human population trends might affect local animal species’ richness stipulates a null hypothesis that animal biodiversity in rural areas will be unaffected in the future by the human population trends shown in Figure 1. Which of the following would best refute this null hypothesis?",
