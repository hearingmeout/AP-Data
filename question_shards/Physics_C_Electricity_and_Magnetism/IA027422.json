    "description": "A biologist is studying territoriality in three related species of birds found in the same section of a forest. For each observed pair of nesting adults, the biologist measured the distance to the next closest nesting pair of the same species (nearest-neighbor distance). An analysis of the results is shown in the table below.",
    "question": "Which of the following would be most appropriate for identifying the species with the most even distribution of nests?",
