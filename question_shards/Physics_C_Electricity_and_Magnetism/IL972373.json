    "question": "Water crosses the plasma membranes of certain eye cells at a higher rate than it does in other cell types. Which of the following best explains why the rate of water transport is higher in the eye cells?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The eye cells move water against the concentration gradient, which is faster than moving water with the concentration gradient.",

        "label": "The eye cells have protein channels that allow water to pass through in greater quantities than the phospholipid bilayer allows.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The eye cells have more <math alttext=\"A T P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ATP</mi></math> than other cells do, which allows them to use active transport to move water across the membrane more rapidly.",

        "label": "The eye cells modify water molecules so that they are positively charged, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer more easily than unmodified water molecules.",
