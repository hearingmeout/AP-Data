    "question": "Which of the following is probably the best explanation for the fact that Antarctic penguins cannot fly, although there is evidence that millions of years ago their ancestors could do so?",

      {
        "label": "Penguins live on land and feed in the water; therefore they have no need to fly.",

        "label": "The Antarctic home of penguins is flat and barren; therefore there is no place to fly.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Ancestral penguins without large wings were better able to swim and feed in the water; therefore they passed their genes for shorter wing structure on to their offspring.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Ancestral penguins did not use their wings for long periods of time; therefore today’s penguins have only tiny, nonfunctional wings.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The cold and wind of Antarctica make flight impossible; therefore penguins that live there have lost the ability to fly.",

    "answer": "Ancestral penguins without large wings were better able to swim and feed in the water; therefore they passed their genes for shorter wing structure on to their offspring."
