    "description": "Water molecules are polar covalent molecules. There is a partial negative charge near the oxygen atom and partial positive charges near the hydrogen atoms due to the uneven distribution of electrons between the atoms, which results in the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The polarity of water molecules contributes to many properties of water that are important for biological processes.",

Hydrogen bonds are shown between the right hydrogen atom of the left water molecule, and the left hydrogen atom of the right water molecule.",
