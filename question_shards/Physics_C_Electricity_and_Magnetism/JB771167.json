    "description": "A cell culture commonly used in research was selected to study the effect of a specific virus on the timing of cell cycle phases. Two separate cultures were started, one untreated and one inoculated with the virus. Both cultures were incubated under identical conditions. After a period of time, 200 cells from each culture were observed and classified as shown in Table 1.",
