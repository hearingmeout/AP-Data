    "description": "A student created a terrarium by placing soil in the bottom of a large glass container. He added several species of mosses and tiny grasses to the soil. The student ensured that the soil and plants were damp by adding water from a nearby creek. He added a few dead, decaying leaves and twigs, some small insects, and a few small garden slugs to the terrarium. He placed an airtight seal on the container and placed the container near a window where it would receive some sunlight but would not overheat. After three years, the terrarium still contains living organisms.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements best explains how this terrarium could sustain living organisms for three years?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "After a short time, the seal began to leak, allowing gaseous forms of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen to enter the terrarium.",
