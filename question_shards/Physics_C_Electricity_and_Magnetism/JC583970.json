An arrow labeled Transcription is positioned on the D N A line about one-third of the way from the left end of the line. The arrow has a 90 degree bend so that it points upward from the D N A line and then to the right. Protein 1 is represented by an oval oriented vertically so that its F half touches the D N A line close to the left end of the line and to the left of the transcription arrow, and the G half makes no contact with the D N A. Protein 2 is represented by a rectangle oriented horizontally slightly above and to the right of protein 1. Neither the L nor the M halves of Protein 2 touch Protein I or the D N A.",
