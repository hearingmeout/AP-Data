        "label": "Prolactin will bind only to intracellular receptors in animal species with phospholipid bilayers, so its effects are varied in different species.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because of different receptors activating different signal transduction pathways within the same species, it is likely that prolactin production is a trait with highly selective pressure.",
