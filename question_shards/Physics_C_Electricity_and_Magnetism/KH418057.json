    "description": "An ecologist collected a large sample of forest soil and distributed it evenly into two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was placed in a temperature control chamber that was maintained at the forest’s average high temperature. Sample B was placed in a separate temperature control chamber that was maintained at \\(5\\degree C\\) above the forest’s average high temperature. Both samples were kept in their chambers for 60 days and were watered with only enough sterile water to keep the soil moist. After 60 days, soil from both samples was removed and tested for ammonia levels. Results are shown in Table 1.",
