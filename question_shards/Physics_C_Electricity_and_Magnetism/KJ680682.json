    "question": "Beaked whales feed at various depths, but they defecate at the ocean’s surface. Nitrogen-rich whale feces deposited in surface waters supply nutrients for algae that are eaten by surface dwelling fish. Which of the following best predicts what would happen if the whale population decreased?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There would be a reduction in surface nitrogen concentration, which would cause an algal bloom.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The surface fish populations would decline due to reduced populations of algae.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The remaining whales would accumulate mutations at a faster rate.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The remaining whales would be forced to forage in the deepest parts of the ocean.",

    ],
    "answer": "The surface fish populations would decline due to reduced populations of algae."
