    "description": "Plant cell walls are composed of cellulose, while fungal cell walls are composed of chitin. A group of scientists hypothesize that this difference means the cell wall has largely different functions in plant cells and fungal cells. Alternatively, another group of scientists hypothesize that despite their biochemical differences, plant and fungal cell walls serve similar functions.",
    "question": "Which of the following observations would best support the alternative hypothesis described above?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Plant cell walls are found just outside the plasma membrane, while fungal cell walls are found just beneath the plasma membrane.",

        "label": "In both plant cells and fungal cells, the cell wall surrounds the outside of the cell membrane.",
