    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "An increase in global temperatures causes an increase in kinetic energy, so chlorine atoms can break down ozone faster and more often in the troposphere.",

      {
        "label": "Low temperatures in the stratosphere break down polar stratospheric clouds that release harmful chlorine containing compounds that break down ozone.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The increase in carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere released from anthropogenic and natural sources break down ozone, creating ozone thinning over highly populated areas.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Low temperatures create polar stratospheric clouds that lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine, which result in the breakdown of ozone at the beginning of the antarctic spring.",
