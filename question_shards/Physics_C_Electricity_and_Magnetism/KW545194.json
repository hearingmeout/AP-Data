    "description": "Scientists are studying the two primary vocalizations made by Belding’s ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi). The trill call consists of a series of medium-pitched notes given rapidly, while the whistle call consists of a single high-pitched note. The objective of the experiment is to determine the function of each vocalization. Recordings of the calls were played to four different groups of squirrels, and the response of each individual squirrel was documented. The responses are summarized in Table 1.",
    "question": "Table 1. Response of ground squirrels to recorded vocalizations Which of the following correctly identifies the dependent variable and the independent variable for the experiment?",
