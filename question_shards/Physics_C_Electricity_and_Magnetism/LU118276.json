    "description": "26. The lac operon in E. coli consists of genes that code for enzymes necessary for the breakdown of lactose. When lactose is absent, the operon is inactive because a repressor protein binds to a specific site in the lac operon. When lactose is present, lactose molecules bind to the repressor protein, causing the repressor protein to dissociate from the binding site. In the absence of glucose (a preferred energy source for bacteria), the protein CAP binds to a regulatory site near the lac promoter to activate transcription of the lac operon.",
    "question": "The following symbols represent the macromolecules involved in regulation of the lac operon. In the diagrams below, the horizontal line represents the lac operon and the bent arrow represents the transcription start site of the lac operon. Which of the following diagrams best represents the scenario in which lactose is available to the cell and glucose is absent?",

A repressor symbol is shown bound to the operon immediately past the transcription start site. The lactose symbol overlaps and partially covers the repressor symbol. The C A P symbol is shown to the left of the transcription start site, above the operon and not bound to anything.",
