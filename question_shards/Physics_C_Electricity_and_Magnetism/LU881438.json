    "description": "A group of researchers claim that chance events play an important role in the evolution of populations. To test their claim, they monitored 12 populations of E. coli for 10,000 generations under the same environmental conditions. They found that although all 12 populations were exposed to the same environmental pressures, each population had differentiated from one another genetically after 10,000 generations.",
