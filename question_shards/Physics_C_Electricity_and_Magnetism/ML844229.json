    "description": "The deep ocean floor communities contain very little life. In constant darkness, the water at these depths hovers around <math alttext=\"2 degrees Celsius\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math>. Sparsely distributed in this environment are hydrothermal vent ecosystems. Superheated water streams out of the vents at temperatures approaching <math alttext=\"400 degrees Celsius\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mn>400</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math>. These waters are rich in inorganic materials, including carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10,000 to 100,000 times greater than found on the surrounding seafloor.",
    "question": "Scientists have studied these vents to determine the energy source for these communities and the identity of the primary producers in the perpetual darkness of the ocean floor. As expected, they found a total absence of photosynthetic organisms at all vents, identifying mats of bacteria as the producers of the carbon compounds that are used by the rest of the community for growth, repair, and as an energy source. Which of the following describes how the vent bacteria harvest energy to produce organic compounds for use by the vent community?",
