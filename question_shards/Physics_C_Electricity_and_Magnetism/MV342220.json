    "description": "Researchers exposed identical cells to solutions containing different solutes. Each solution had a higher concentration of the solute outside the cells than inside the cells. The solutes varied in size, charge, and polarity. After a set time, the researchers measured the concentration of each solute inside the cells to determine the permeability of the cell membranes to each solute. The results are shown in Table 1.",
    "question": "Table 1. Permeability of Cell Membranes to Different Solutes Solute Size Charge Polarity Initial Concentration outside the cell Concentration Inside the Cell A Small Neutral Nonpolar High High B Large Positive Nonpolar High Low C Small Negative Polar High Medium Based on the data in Table 1, which of the following statements best supports the hypothesis that only certain types of molecules can move freely across the cell membranes?",
