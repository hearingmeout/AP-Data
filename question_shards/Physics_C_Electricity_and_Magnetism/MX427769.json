    "question": "The National Education Association (NEA) is an organization of teachers, administrators, and other educators who work together to advance the interests and impact of public education.

Vouchers give parents financial incentives to send their children to private schools rather than having children attend local public schools. Which of the following strategies would be the most effective way to achieve the NEA’s goal of furthering the interest of public education?",
