    "question": "In anoles, small toe pads are better for gripping irregular surfaces such as the forest floor, and large toe pads are better for gripping smooth surfaces such as leaves. Based on the data in Table 1, if brown anoles are introduced into a forest where green anoles currently live, which of the following predictions about the two species is most likely?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Brown anoles will occupy a different area of the forest from green anoles which will minimize competition.",

      {
        "label": "Brown anoles will mostly prey on flying insects, and green anoles will prey on worms and grubs.",

      {
        "label": "Brown anoles and green anoles will evolve to have the same size toe pads because they share the same niche.",
