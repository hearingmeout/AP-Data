    "description": "In a study of energy flow, the following data were collected:",
    "question": "Each human requires 55 grams of protein per day. An acre of soybeans produces 200,000 grams of protein per year. A cow grazing on one acre of land produces 19,000 grams of protein per year. Based on these data, an acre of land would support: 10 humans per year on a diet of soy, or 0.9 human per year on a diet of beef. Which of the following statements best explains these relationships in terms of energy transfer?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Humans are better adapted to make efficient use of soy protein than beef protein, so they can extract more energy from a gram of soy protein than from a gram of beef protein.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A cow can harvest energy only at a certain rate, so adding another cow to the acre of land would double the number of humans supported by the acre.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Preparing meat for human consumption takes more energy per gram of protein than preparing soy for consumption.",

      {
        "label": "Only 10% of the energy on each level of the trophic pyramid is available for use by the next level. The rest is lost as heat or used for growth and repair.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "Only 10% of the energy on each level of the trophic pyramid is available for use by the next level. The rest is lost as heat or used for growth and repair."
