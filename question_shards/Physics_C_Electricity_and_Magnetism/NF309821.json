A section of a cell’s plasma membrane, showing a channel protein and a concentration gradient across the membrane An investigator wants to understand whether a newly found membrane protein is involved in membrane transport of a certain particle. Which investigation will help determine whether the new membrane protein is a channel protein involved in membrane transport?",
