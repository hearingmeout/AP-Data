    "question": "Pigment Color of Reflected Light Chlorophyll <math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> Green Phycocyanin Blue Allophycocyanin Blue Phycoerythrin Red Cyanobacteria contain a variety of pigment molecules, as shown in Table 1. As a result, the color of cyanobacteria cultures can vary significantly based on the relative amount of each pigment produced. A researcher placed a culture of cyanobacteria under green lights. Within a few weeks, the appearance of the cyanobacteria changed from green to red. The researcher claimed the color change in the culture was the result of an adaptation allowing greater photosynthesis. Which of the following provides the best reasoning to justify the researcher’s claim?",

      {
        "label": "In green light, more chlorophyll a molecules are produced, reflecting more light to other cyanobacteria to be used for photosynthesis.",

        "label": "In green light, more phycoerythrin molecules are produced, allowing more green light to be absorbed, thus increasing photosynthesis.",
