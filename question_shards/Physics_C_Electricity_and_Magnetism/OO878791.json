Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. In many countries, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting the parasite that causes malaria to people through their bites. A primary tool for mosquito control is the use of insecticidal nets sprayed with chemicals known as pyrethroids, which are relatively safe for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However, mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has now become widespread. Pyrethroids interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells of the mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino acid position 1014. Scientists hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance. Figure 1. Schematic drawing of the transmembrane sodium channel targeted by pyrethroids and other insecticides. The arrow points to the position of amino acid 1014. To investigate pyrethroid resistance, mosquitoes were collected four times over a two-year period from the following two regions. Region A: a southern vegetable-growing region where large amounts of insecticide are applied for crop protection Region B: a northern rice-growing region where very little insecticide is applied for rice protection Scientists exposed the collected mosquitoes to filter papers soaked in two different pyrethroid insecticides, deltamethrin and permethrin, and the percent mortality of the mosquitoes was determined after 24 hours (Figure 2). The scientists simultaneously determined whether leucine or phenylalanine was encoded at position 1014 by each of the two copies of the sodium channel gene (Table 1). Figure 2. Susceptibility of A. gambiae mosquitoes from two regions to the pyrethroids deltamethrin and permethrin. A mosquito strain that is susceptible to the insecticides displayed at least 95% mortality in all experiments, and mosquitoes exposed to untreated filter paper displayed less than 10% mortality. Error bars represent standard deviation. \"ND\" means no data are available. Table 1.

The scientists claim that the mosquito population of region B evolved resistance over the period of the experiment and that resistance arose as a result of the immigration of resistant mosquitoes from other regions.
