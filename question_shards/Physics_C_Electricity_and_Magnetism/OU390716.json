    "description": "ATPase requires the use of ATP to move ions from one side of a cell membrane to another. The amino acid cysteine is important to the function of ATPase. A change in the cysteine prevents the ATPase from functioning.",
    "question": "Which of the following best describes what will happen to the movement of ions if there is a change in the cysteine of ATPase?",

      {
