    "description": "Researchers compared similar proteins from related organisms in different habitats. They found that the proteins from organisms living in harsh environments had a greater number of cysteine amino acids than did proteins from organisms not living in harsh environments. The structure of cysteine is shown. Bonds can form between the sulfur atom of different cysteine amino acids (<math alttext=\"S S\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>S-S</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> bonds).",
    "question": "Figure 1. Chemical structure of cysteine Which of the following best describes the effect of a greater number of cysteine amino acids on the stability of the proteins?",
