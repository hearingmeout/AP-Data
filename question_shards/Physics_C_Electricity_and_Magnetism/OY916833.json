        "label": "Wolves are not affected by factors that typically limit the population size; therefore their population can grow exponentially, increasing the demand on the parks’ resources.",

      {
        "label": "Wolves prey on other species without having any natural predators themselves; therefore their presence significantly decreases many populations within the community.",
