    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.In the mid 1970s, Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina predicted a thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer over Antarctica. The thinning was confirmed in the late twentieth century and has continued into the twenty-first century.Identify the class of chemical compounds that is primarily responsible for the thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer and describe TWO major uses for which these chemicals were manufactured.Describe how the chemical compounds that you identified in part (a) destroy stratospheric ozone molecules. You may include chemical equations as part of your answer.Identify the major environmental consequence of the depletion of stratospheric ozone and describe TWO effects on ecosystems and/or human health that can result.Ozone formed at ground level is a harmful pollutant. Describe TWO effects that ground-level ozone can have on ecosystems and/or human health.",
