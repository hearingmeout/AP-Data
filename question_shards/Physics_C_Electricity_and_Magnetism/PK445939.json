Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.Paramecia are single‑celled aquatic eukaryotes that can survive in a wide range of salinities. Paramecia use contractile vacuoles to help maintain homeostasis under these varying salt conditions. The contractile vacuoles fill with fluid and then contract to remove the fluid from the paramecia.Scientists wished to determine the effect of salinity on contractile vacuole activity. They maintained different groups of paramecia in water of different salinities for one month. They then measured the average amount of fluid ejected from the contractile vacuoles in each group of paramecia each time the vacuoles contracted (Table 1).Table 1.
