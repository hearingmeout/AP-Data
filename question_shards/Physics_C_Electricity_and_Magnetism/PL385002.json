    "question": "A researcher released large numbers of moths into different environments in an attempt to better understand a mechanism of evolution. The moths were released in four trials as described in the table above. Each of the released moths had a small mark on the underside of a wing for identification. After an appropriate amount of time, the researcher recaptured as many of the released moths as possible. Data from the experiment are included in the table above. Which of the following claims is best supported by the data?",
