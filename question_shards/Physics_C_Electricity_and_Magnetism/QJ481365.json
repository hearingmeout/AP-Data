    "description": "Phycobiliproteins are a complex of accessory pigments and proteins found in cyanobacteria but not in green algae. A researcher claims that the phycobiliprotein pigments in cyanobacteria allow the cyanobacteria to survive in certain aquatic niches better than green algae can.",

      {
        "label": "The additional pigments allow the cyanobacteria to store light energy so that it can be used at night to continue photosynthesis.",

        "label": "The additional pigments block light and prevent it from reaching photosynthetic organisms at greater depths, so no photosynthetic organisms can live below the surface waters containing cyanobacteria.",
