    "question": "The American whooping crane and the California condor are two of North America's largest birds. Although both are rare and endangered, they are protected, and large preserves are available for them. The two species, however, seem to be responding differently to these conservation efforts. In 1937, the whooping crane population was reduced to 14 individuals. It has since recovered; currently more than 200 birds live and breed in the wild. In the preservation of endangered species, the whooping crane is a success story. On the other hand, the California condor population declined rapidly so that no birds remained in the wild between 1987 and 1992. Condors were reintroduced into the wild after 1992 and approximately 50 condors currently live in the wild in California and Arizona. However, the recovery program cannot yet be considered a success. (a) Identify and describe TWO major causes for the original decline of these species. (You may describe one cause for each species or two causes for one species.)(b) Describe TWO measures that have been taken to protect these species. (Specify which of the species benefited from each measure.) (c) Describe TWO important characteristics of an endangered species that would cause it to be slow to recover. (d) Make one economic or ecological argument for protecting the condor, the whooping crane, or another endangered species that you identify and make one economic or ecological argument against protecting it.",
