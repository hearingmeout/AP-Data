    "description": "The heterotroph hypothesis of the origin of life states that basic organic building blocks formed from inorganic molecules under the primitive conditions present early in Earth’s development. These building blocks combined to form polymers, such as crude proteins. Dr. Sidney Fox wished to add to the heterotroph hypothesis of the origin of life by synthesizing simple proteins from a mixture of amino acids.",
    "question": "Which statement below best states an alternative hypothesis Fox could have used to frame his research?",
