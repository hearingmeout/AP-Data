    "description": "In an experiment, 100 mice were released into a field to which no other mice had access. Immediately after their release, a representative sample of mice was captured, their fur color was recorded, and they were returned to the field. After twenty years, a representative sample of mice was captured and the distribution of fur color was again recorded.",
    "question": "Which of the following could best explain the change in fur color distribution, as shown in the table above?",
