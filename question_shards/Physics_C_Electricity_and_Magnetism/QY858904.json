        "text": "A rapidly growing suburban municipality purchases nearby forested land and proposes a newly planned housing development, which would involve clear-cutting much of the area for the construction of single-family homes. While evaluating the land, the development committee discovers that development will encroach upon the habitat of a wood thrush population. The wood thrush is a solitary, territorial bird whose preferred habitat consists of large, intact densely forested areas. Wood thrush populations are also threatened by cowbirds. A cowbird lays her egg in an existing nest of a wood thrush. After the cowbird egg hatches, the cowbird pushes the unhatched wood thrush eggs out. The wood thrush parents raise the cowbird hatchling as their own.(b) Identify the symbiotic relationship between the wood thrush and the cowbird.",
