    "question": "Lemurs are primates that live on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa. Lemurs have a functional GULO gene and are able to produce ascorbic acid. However, primates that live in other places (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans) have a GULO pseudogene and are unable to produce ascorbic acid. Which of the following best explains the genetic variation among primate species?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Food sources on the island of Madagascar were deficient in ascorbic acid, which caused the primates to migrate to the mainland where ascorbic acid–rich foods are more widely available.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Human activity on Madagascar, including poaching, drove the other primates into extinction on the island.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Food sources where non-Madagascar primates lived provided ample ascorbic acid in the diet, which removed the selective pressure for maintaining a functional GULO gene.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Food sources on the island of Madagascar were deficient in ascorbic acid, which caused lemurs to adapt by developing the ability to produce an active GULO protein.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
