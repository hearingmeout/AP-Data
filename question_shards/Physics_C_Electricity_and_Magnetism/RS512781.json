    "description": "To test their hypothesis, the researchers conducted a laboratory experiment in which groups of hares were exposed to gradually decreasing periods of daylight. The lengths of the daylight period when molting began were recorded.",
    "question": "Which of the following experimental controls should have been included to ensure that the results could be attributed to changes in the daylight period and not to some other variable?",
