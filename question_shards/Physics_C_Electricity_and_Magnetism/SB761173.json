    "description": "The Russian blue is a rare breed of cat that is susceptible to developing cataracts on the eyes. Scientists hypothesize that this condition is inherited as a result of a mutation. Figure 1 shows a pedigree obtained in a study of cats owned by members of the Russian Blue Club in Sweden.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Pedigree of Russian blue cats owned by Russian Blue Club Based on the inheritance pattern shown in Figure 1, which of the following best predicts the nature of the original mutation?",
