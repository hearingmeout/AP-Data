    "question": "For a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, certain conditions must be met. Which of the following best explains a characteristic of the fly populations that meets a condition of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The population size of the flies was very small, which increases the likelihood of random mutations having a greater impact.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Since the flies were confined in chambers, they did not experience any migration, so no new alleles were introduced through migration.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Flies have a relatively short generation time and therefore are more likely to pass mutations to the next generation.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The different food sources may have exerted selective pressure on the fly populations, giving an advantage to certain flies.",
