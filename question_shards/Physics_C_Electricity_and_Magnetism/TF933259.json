    "description": "A sample of human blood was placed in a test tube containing a physiological saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride). This type of solution is often used intravenously to quickly rehydrate patients. A drop of the blood from the test tube was placed on a slide and red blood cells (RBCs) were observed under a microscope. Three possible outcomes are diagrammed below.",
    "question": "Which of the following best predicts which diagrammed microscope view the laboratory worker would see and best explains why?",
