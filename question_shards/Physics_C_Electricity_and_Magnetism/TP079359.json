It is important that you read each question completely before you begin. Genetically modified crops have been developed that produce a protein that makes the plants resistant to insect pests. Other genetic modifications make the crops more resistant to chemicals that kill plants (herbicides). (a) Describe TWO potential biological risks of large-scale cultivation and use of such genetically modified plants.",
