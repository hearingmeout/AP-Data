    "question": "During an El Niño event, warm surface water moves from the western equatorial Pacific Ocean to the eastern equatorial region. Which of the following best describes how the warm water will affect upwelling off the coast of equatorial South America?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The warm surface water will not change upwelling because this region is at the equator and always has warm water.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warm surface water will increase upwelling because of the difference in salinity between the warm surface water and the cold deep water.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warm surface water will decrease upwelling because the cooler temperatures on land in the region will prevent upwelling.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warm surface water will decrease upwelling because of the density difference between the warm surface water and the cold deep water.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The warm surface water will decrease upwelling because of the density difference between the warm surface water and the cold deep water."
