    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.The Colorado River runs 1,450 miles from the headwaters of the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of California. The river has many dams, aqueducts, and canals that divert water in order to supply water for electricity, irrigation, recreation, and domestic use.Describe and discuss two environmental problems that are associated with water diversion.If there is a shortage of water, choices will have to be made as to whether water should be diverted to urban areas, agricultural areas, or natural ecosystems. Make an argument for diverting water for urban consumption and an argument for permitting the flow of water to natural areas.Identify another example (other than the Colorado River) of a large-scale water-diversion project. Discuss two environmental problems that have resulted, or might result, from this project.",
