    "description": "A group of biologists were investigating the effects of light color on phototropism (growing toward the light source) in tomato plants. Four groups of tomato plants were grown in the same greenhouse under identical conditions. Each group was then placed in a different room, each room having a different color of light, exposed to that single color of light from different directions for one week at a time. After each week, the biologists counted the number of tomato plants in the groups that were showing evidence of phototropism. The results are summarized in Table 1.",
    "question": "Table 1. Phototropic responses of plants to different colors of light Which of the following correctly identifies the dependent and independent variables in this experiment?",
