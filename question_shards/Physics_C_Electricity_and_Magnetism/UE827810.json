    "description": "A researcher proposes a model to explain how enzyme-substrate interactions determine enzyme specificity. The model is based on the idea that substrate molecules form favorable interactions with the amino acid side chains in an enzyme’s active site.",
    "question": "Based on the model, which of the following statements best explains an enzyme’s specificity for a particular substrate molecule?",
