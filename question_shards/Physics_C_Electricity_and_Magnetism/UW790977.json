    "question": "The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is harmless unless a lysogenic bacteriophage provides the gene coding for the cholera toxin, which converts the bacterium to the virulent form that causes cholera. Which of the following best explains how the gene encoding cholera toxin becomes part of the bacterial genome?",
