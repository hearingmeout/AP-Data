    "description": "Some plant species flower in response to increasing daily temperatures in the spring. Many of these species rely on pollinators that migrate based on changes in day length and the position of the Sun. The current global warming trend is placing new selective pressures on the species involved in these relationships.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the impact of these new selective pressures on the organisms involved?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "If the environment for the plant species becomes too warm, the pollinators will no longer migrate to that area in the spring, continuing on to a more northern environment instead.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The warmer temperatures will lead to a drier environment, so the plants will no longer produce enough nectar to attract the pollinators.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The plant species will flower earlier in the spring in response to rising temperatures before the arrival of the pollinators, so seeds will not be produced.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Migrating pollinators will start migrating later in the year, switching from spring-flowering plants to summer-flowering plants.",

      }
    ],
