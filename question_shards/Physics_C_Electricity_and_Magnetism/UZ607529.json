    "description": "Researchers investigated the effect of urea on the three-dimensional structure of a certain enzyme. The researchers dissolved the enzyme in an aqueous buffer solution and added urea to the solution. The enzyme did not appear to have a secondary or tertiary structure. The researchers carefully removed the urea from the solution and determined that the enzyme had the original secondary and tertiary structure again.",
    "question": "Based on the results of the experiment, which of the following statements best predicts the effect of urea on the enzyme’s function?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Function will be disrupted by adding the urea and regained by removing the urea.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Function will be disrupted by adding the urea, but it will not be regained by removing the urea.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Function will be gained by adding the urea and disrupted by removing the urea.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Function will be unaffected by the addition and removal of the urea.",

    "answer": "Function will be disrupted by adding the urea and regained by removing the urea."
