    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\nThe following poem was first published in 1934.\n\nThe Leaf and the Tree\n When will you learn, my self, to be\n A dying leaf on a living tree?\n Budding, swelling, growing strong,\n Wearing green, but not for long,\n5Drawing sustenance from air,\n That other leaves, and you not there,\n May bud, and at the autumn’s call\n Wearing russet, ready to fall?\n\nHas not this trunk a deed to do\n10Unguessed by small and tremulous you?\n Shall not these branches in the end\n To wisdom and the truth ascend?\n And the great lightning plunging by\n Look sidewise with a golden eye\n15To glimpse a tree so tall and proud\n It sheds its leaves upon a cloud?\n\nHere, I think, is the heart’s grief:\n The tree, no mightier than the leaf,\n Makes firm its root and spreads its crown\n20And stands; but in the end comes down.\n That airy top no boy could climb\n Is trodden in a little time\n By cattle on their way to drink.\n The fluttering thoughts a leaf can think,\n25That hears the wind and waits its turn,\n Have taught it all a tree can learn.\n\nTime can make soft that iron wood.\n The tallest trunk that ever stood,\n In time, without a dream to keep,\n30Crawls in beside the root to sleep.\nEdna St. Vincent Millay, “The Leaf and the Tree” from Collected Poems.
