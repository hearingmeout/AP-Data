In 1630, he was ordained an Anglican priest and made rector at Bemerton. His collected poetry was not published until after his death, when his friend Nicholas Ferrar had it published as The Temple (1633).\n\nTime\n Meeting with Time, “Slack thing,” said I,\n “Thy scythe1scythe: long-handled blade used for cutting grass or grain by hand. is dull; whet2whet: sharpen. it for shame.”\n “No marvel, sir,” he did reply,\n “If it at length deserve some blame;\n5But where one man would have me grind it,\n Twenty for one too sharp do find it.”\n\n“Perhaps some such of old did pass,\n Who above all things loved this life;\n To whom thy scythe a hatchet was,\n10Which now is but a pruning knife.\n Christ’s coming3From a Christian perspective, death is viewed not as an endpoint but as passage to the afterlife. Christ’s redemptive suffering enables the reunification of the soul with God after death. hath made man thy debtor,\n Since by thy cutting he grows better.\n\n“And in his blessing thou art blessed,\n For where thou only wert before\n15An executioner at best,\n Thou art a gardener now, and more,\n An usher4usher: one who escorts persons to their seats to convey our souls\n Beyond the utmost stars and poles.\n\n“And this is that makes life so long,\n20While it detains us from our God.\n Ev’n pleasures here increase the wrong,\n And length of days lengthens the rod5rod: shoot, branch; instrument of punishment.\n Who wants6wants: lacks the place where God doth dwell\n Partakes already half of hell.\n\n25“Of what strange length must that needs be,\n Which ev’n eternity excludes!”—\n Thus far Time heard me patiently,\n Then chafing7chafing: showing irritation said, “This man deludes:\n What do I here before his door?\n30He doth not crave less time, but more.”",
