    "question": "A student sets up the circuit shown above consisting of a battery, a resistor, an ammeter, and a voltmeter. The student is attempting to determine the resistance of the resistor by using the potential difference measured by the voltmeter and the current measured by the ammeter. Which of the following possible sources of error in the experiment would alone result in an inaccurate calculation of the resistance of the resistor at that instant?\n\nThe battery has internal resistance.\n\nThe wire has nonnegligible resistance.\n\nThe ammeter is not ideal.",
