The ammeter <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> has negligible resistance, and the current through the voltmeter <math alttext=\"V\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is negligible. The internal resistance of the battery is negligible.
