    "question": "As shown in the diagram, when environmental temperatures drop below freezing, a layer of ice typically forms on the surface of bodies of freshwater such as lakes and rivers.\n\nWhich of the following best describes how the structure of ice benefits the organisms that live in the water below?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The water molecules in ice are closer together than those in liquid water, so the ice prevents the passage of air to the water, maintaining a constant gas mixture in the water.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The water molecules in ice are closer together than those in liquid water, so the ice forms a barrier that protects the organisms in the water from the freezing air temperatures.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The water molecules in ice are farther apart than those in liquid water, so the ice floats, maintaining the warmer, denser water at the lake bottom.",
