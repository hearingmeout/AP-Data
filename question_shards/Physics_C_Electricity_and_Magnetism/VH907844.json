    "question": "Figure 1 is a diagram of water molecules at the air-water interface at the surface of a pond.\n\nFigure 1. Alignment of water molecules at air-water interface\n\nBased on Figure 1, which of the following best describes how the properties of water at an air-water interface enable an insect to walk on the water's surface?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Covalent bonds between water molecules and the air above provide cohesion, which causes tiny bubbles to form under the feet of the insect.",
