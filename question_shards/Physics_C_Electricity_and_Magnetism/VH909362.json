    "description": "The graph below shows three different survivorship curves.",
    "question": "Scientists determined that a species of a reptile dinosaur cohort had 20% survivorship during the first two years of life, but then the survivorship of those individuals that survived to age 2 had a 70% survivorship to middle age. Survivorship declined later in life. Which of the following best illustrates the shape of the survivorship curve for this species?",

The numbers 1, 10, and 100 are evenly spaced from bottom to top along the vertical axis. The survivorship curve begins slightly to the right of the 100 on the vertical axis. It drops steeply to a point with vertical axis value slightly above 1 and horizontal axis value of slightly more than 2. The curve then rises to the right to a point with vertical axis value between 10 and 100, and horizontal axis value of approximately 10. The curve then turns downward slightly and ends at a horizontal axis value of 12.",

It then moves vertically downward in a straight line to a point with vertical axis value slightly above 1 and horizontal axis value between 8 and 10.
