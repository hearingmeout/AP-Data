    "description": "A team of ecologists are studying four different ecosystems with varying levels of biodiversity. The ecologists categorize the different levels of biodiversity for the four ecosystems as shown in the table below.\n Genetic Diversity Species Diversity Habitat Diversity Ecosystem A Low Low Medium Ecosystem B Medium High Medium Ecosystem C High Low Low Ecosystem D Medium Low High",
    "question": "Based on the information above, which of the following best describes Ecosystem C?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Its low species diversity indicates that Ecosystem C most likely has species with very low population sizes.",

      {
        "label": "Its high genetic diversity indicates that Ecosystem C most likely has species that evolve quickly.",

      {
        "label": "Its high genetic diversity indicates that Ecosystem C is most likely the result of the founder effect and a subpopulation originating from Ecosystem A.",

      {
        "label": "Its low habitat diversity indicates that Ecosystem C most likely has a low number of specialist species and few species that utilize large territories.",

    "answer": "Its low habitat diversity indicates that Ecosystem C most likely has a low number of specialist species and few species that utilize large territories."
