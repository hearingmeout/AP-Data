    "question": "A student wants to determine the resistance of two resistors by connecting them to a battery and using voltmeters <math alttext=\"V\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and ammeters <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to take measurements of potential difference and current, respectively. Which of the following circuits would be best for finding the rate at which energy is dissipated for each of the two resistors?",
