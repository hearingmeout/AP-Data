    "question": "Students draw the schematic diagram shown above for a circuit they constructed using six identical resistors of resistance <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, a battery of emf <math alttext=\"epsilon\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>ε</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> , and an ammeter. A second group of students constructs another circuit using identical materials, but their schematic diagram looks different. Which of the following diagrams would dissipate energy at the same rate as the one shown above?",
