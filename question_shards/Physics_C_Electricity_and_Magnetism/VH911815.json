    "question": "Three identical resistors are connected in a series circuit with a variable power supply. A graph of the power <math alttext=\"P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> provided to the circuit as a function of current <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is shown above. Which of the following graphs shows the power dissipated by one of the resistors as a function of the current through that resistor?",
