    "description": "Workers at a warehouse of consumer goods gather items from the warehouse to fill customer orders. The number of items in a sample of orders and the time, in minutes, it took the workers to gather the items were recorded. A scatterplot of the recorded data showed a curved pattern, and the square root of the number of items was taken to create a linear pattern. The following table shows computer output from the least-squares regression analysis created to predict the time it takes to gather items from the number of items in an order.",
