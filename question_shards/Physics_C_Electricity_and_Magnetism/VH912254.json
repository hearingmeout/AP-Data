    "description": "A small-business owner collected data from a random sample on the amount spent on an order and the time it takes to fill the order. The resulting data were used to complete a linear regression analysis of time, in minutes, versus amount spent, in dollars, and to create the following residual plot.",
    "question": "Based on the residual plot, which condition for inference for the slope of the regression line does not appear to be satisfied?",
