    "description": "Students conducted a controlled experiment to investigate whether sawdust provides enough nutrients to support plant growth. The students separated ten nearly identical sunflower seedlings into two groups. They grew the seedlings in the first group in potting soil and the seedlings in the second group in sawdust composed mostly of cellulose. After twenty days, the students recorded observations about the seedlings in each group. The students’ observations are presented in the table.",

Seedlings in sawdust <math alttext=\"4.8 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mtext>4.8 cm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow></math> The leaves have a grayish color and are small in size. The observed differences between the groups most likely resulted from differences in the ability of the seedlings to produce which of the following monomers?",
