    "description": "A researcher proposes a model of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in which a reactant is converted to a product. The model is based on the idea that the reactant passes through a transition state within the enzyme-substrate complex before the reactant is converted to the product.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements best helps explain how the enzyme speeds up the reaction?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The enzyme’s active site binds to and stabilizes the reactant, which decreases the free-energy change of the reaction.",

        "label": "The enzyme’s active site binds to and stabilizes both the reactant and the product at the same time, which increases the reaction’s equilibrium constant.",
