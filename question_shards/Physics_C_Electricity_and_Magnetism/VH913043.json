    "description": "The enzyme hexokinase catalyzes the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which is an important step in glycolysis. The reaction involves the transfer of a phosphate group from <math alttext=\"A T P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> to glucose.",
    "question": "Either a glucose molecule or a water molecule can fit in the active site of hexokinase. The presence of a water molecule in hexokinase’s active site would result in the hydrolysis of <math alttext=\"A T P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"A D P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ADP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> instead of the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Which of the following statements best helps explain the reaction specificity of hexokinase?",
