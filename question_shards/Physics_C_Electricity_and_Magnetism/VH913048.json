    "question": "A researcher claims that different enzymes exhibit maximal function over different <math alttext=\"p H\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> ranges. To test the claim, the researcher carries out an experiment that includes three different enzymes: pepsin, salivary amylase, and arginase. The results of the experiment are represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. The effect of <math alttext=\"p H\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> on three different enzymes\n\nWhich of the following actions will provide the most appropriate negative control for the experiment?",
