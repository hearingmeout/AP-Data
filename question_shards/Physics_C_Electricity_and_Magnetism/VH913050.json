    "question": "A researcher claims that spinach leaves capture the most energy from light waves in the range of 500 <math alttext=\"nanometers\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>nm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> to 600 <math alttext=\"nanometers\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>nm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. To test the claim, the researcher will place spinach leaves in separate chambers and expose the leaves to different wavelengths of light. For each chamber, the researcher will measure the amount of oxygen gas <math alttext=\"or O 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>(</mtext><msub><mrow><mtext>O</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msub><mtext>)</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> that is produced in one hour.\nWhich of the following graphs best represents data from the experiment that will support the researcher’s claim?",
