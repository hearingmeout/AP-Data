    "question": "In an experiment, cells were isolated from an aquatic plant and suspended in pond water, a sucrose sugar solution, or distilled water. All of the cells were then viewed under a microscope. Compared with the cell in the pond water, the cell in the sugar solution appeared shriveled, and the cell in the distilled water appeared inflated. The results of the experiment are represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. The results of an experiment using aquatic plant cells\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the observations represented in Figure 1 ?",
