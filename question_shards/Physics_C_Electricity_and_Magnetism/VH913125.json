    "question": "European flycatchers feed caterpillars to their hatchlings. Graph 1 shows the average dates of hatching and fledging (leaving the nest), and the biomass of the caterpillars between early May (when flycatcher young hatch) and June (when fledging of young occurs).\n\nGraph 1. Comparison of European flycatcher hatching and fledging dates and caterpillar biomass\n\nBased on the data, scientists claim that the reproductive behavior of European flycatchers is influenced by the availability of energy sources. Which of the following statements best justifies this claim?",
