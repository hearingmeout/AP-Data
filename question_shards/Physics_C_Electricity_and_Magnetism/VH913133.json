    "question": "A researcher claims that the initial rise of oxygen in Earth’s early atmosphere, which occurred approximately 2.3 billion years ago, resulted from the metabolic activity of prokaryotic organisms. The claim is based on an interpretation of the geochemical and fossil evidence represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Selected events in geologic time based on geochemical and fossil evidence\n\nWhich of the following types of evidence will best support the researcher’s claim?",
