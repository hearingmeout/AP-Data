    "question": "A market research firm is studying the effects of price and type of packaging on sales of a particular product. Twenty-seven stores with shoppers of similar characteristics will be used in the study. The nine combinations of three price levels and three packaging types are the treatments of interest. Total sales of the product over a seven-week period will be recorded. Which of the following describes the best design to use for the study?",
