    "question": "Researchers conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of a valinomycin treatment on skeletal muscle cells. Valinomycin is a naturally occurring substance that can be used as a drug. The results of the experiment are presented in the table.\n\nRelative Rates of <math alttext=\"A T P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> Production\n\nTime after Treatment \nUntreated Cells\nValinomycin-Treated Cells \n\n5 minutes \n1.0\n0.3\n\n10 minutes \n7.7\n2.7\n\nWhich of the following claims about the effects of the valinomycin treatment is best supported by the data presented in the table?",
