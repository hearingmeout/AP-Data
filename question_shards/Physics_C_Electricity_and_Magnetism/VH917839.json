    "question": "The quality control manager at a factory records the number of equipment breakdowns each day. Let the random variable <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of breakdowns in one day. The standard deviation of <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is 0.28. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the standard deviation?",
