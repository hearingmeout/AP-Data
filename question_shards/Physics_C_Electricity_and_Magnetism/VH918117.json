    "question": "Cholesterol is a naturally occurring substance that helps regulate the fluidity of a cell’s plasma membrane. A cholesterol molecule can be represented as having a polar head and a nonpolar region, as shown in the figure.\n\nWhich of the following models shows how cholesterol molecules most likely interact with the phospholipid bilayer of a cell’s plasma membrane?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a phospholipid bilayer and cholesterol molecules. The polar head of each cholesterol molecule is situated between the heads of the phospholipids, and the nonpolar region extends out and away from the membrane.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a phospholipid bilayer and cholesterol molecules. Each cholesterol molecule lies flat against the outer surface of the membrane so that the polar head and nonpolar region of each molecule are both in contact with the phospholipid heads.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The figure presents a phospholipid bilayer and cholesterol molecules. The cholesterol molecules are located in the interior of the membrane and separate the two layers of the bilayer from each other.",
