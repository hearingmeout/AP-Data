    "description": "In vascular plants, water flows from root to leaf via specialized cells called xylem. Xylem cells are hollow cells stacked together like a straw. A student explains that evaporation of water from the leaf pulls water up from the roots through the xylem, as shown in Figure 1.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Model of water movement through the xylem, with magnified models of water movement in the stem and leaf. Which statement describes how water is pulled up through the xylem to the leaves of the plant?",
