    "question": "Researchers have proposed a model of the process by which a newly synthesized protein is transported to the plasma membrane and secreted into the extracellular space. The model is represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. A model of the intracellular transport of a newly synthesized secreted protein\n\nBased on the model, the newly synthesized protein is transported directly from the endoplasmic reticulum to which of the following?",
