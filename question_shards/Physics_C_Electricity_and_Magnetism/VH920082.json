    "question": "A certain factory that manufactures office chairs has a quality control process to identify defective chairs. The binomial random variable <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represents the number of chairs in a sample of chairs that are defective. The mean of <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is 10 chairs and the standard deviation is 3 chairs. Based on the distribution of <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, which of the following would be an accurate interpretation of the value 0.1 ?",
