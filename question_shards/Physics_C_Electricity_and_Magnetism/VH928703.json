    "question": "A company is considering purchasing the mineral rights to two different mountains. The probability that it will purchase the mineral rights to the first mountain is 0.55. The probability that it will purchase the mineral rights to the second mountain is 0.4. Assuming the decisions to purchase the mineral rights to each mountain are made independently, what is the probability that it will purchase the mineral rights to exactly one of the two mountains?",
