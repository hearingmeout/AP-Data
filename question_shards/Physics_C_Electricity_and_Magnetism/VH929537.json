    "question": "A researcher designs an experiment to investigate whether soil bacteria trigger the synthesis of defense enzymes in plant roots. The design of the experiment is presented in Table 1. For each group in the experiment, the researcher will determine the average rate of change in the amount of defense enzymes in the roots of the seedlings.\n\nTable 1. An experiment to investigate the effect of soil bacteria on plant defenses\n\nGroup \nNumber of Seedlings \nType of Soil \nTreatment Solution \n\n1 \n10 \nSterile potting soil \nContains actively reproducing soil bacteria \n\n2 \n10 \nSterile potting soil \nContains heat-killed soil bacteria \n\n3 \n10 \nSterile potting soil \nContains no soil bacteria \n\nWhich of the following statements best helps justify the inclusion of group 2 as one of the controls in the experiment?",
