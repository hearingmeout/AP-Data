    "question": "A researcher claims that increasing the environmental temperature by <math alttext=\"10 degrees Celsius\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>10 </mtext><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> will double the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. To test the claim, the researcher designs an experiment that uses a particular enzyme isolated from plants. The design of the experiment is presented in Table 1. For each test tube in the experiment, the researcher will measure the rate of product formation.\n\nTest Tube \nTemperature (<math alttext=\"in degrees Celsius\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext><mtext></mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) \nSubstrate Added \nEnzyme Added \nPretreated by Boiling \n\n1 \n15 \nYes \nYes \nNo \n\n2 \n25 \nNo \nYes \nNo \n\n3 \n25 \nYes \nNo \nNo \n\n4 \n25 \nYes \nYes \nNo \n\n5 \n25 \nYes \nYes \nYes \n\n6 \n35 \nYes \nYes \nNo \n\nWhich of the following statements best helps justify the inclusion of test tube 5 as a control in the experiment?",
