    "question": "At a certain restaurant, 35 percent of the customers order the daily special each day. Assume that each day the customers arrive randomly and order independently. Let the random variable <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of orders placed until the first daily special is ordered. The distribution of <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is geometric and has an expected value of approximately 2.86. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the expected value?",
