    "question": "TABLE 1. PHOTOPIGMENTS IN CYANOBACTERIA\n\nPigment\nColor of Reflected Light\n\nChlorophyll <math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\nGreen\n\nPhycocyanin\nBlue\n\nAllophycocyanin\nBlue\n\nPhycoerythrin\nRed\n\nCyanobacteria contain a variety of pigment molecules, as shown in Table 1. As a result, the color of cyanobacteria cultures can vary significantly based on the relative amount of each pigment produced.\n\nA researcher placed a culture of cyanobacteria under green lights. Within a few weeks, the appearance of the cyanobacteria changed from green to red. The researcher claimed the color change in the culture was the result of an adaptation allowing greater photosynthesis.\n\nWhich of the following provides the best reasoning to justify the researcher’s claim?",

        "label": "In green light, more phycoerythrin molecules are produced, allowing more green light to be absorbed, thus increasing photosynthesis.",
