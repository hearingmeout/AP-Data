    "question": "A student used microscopy to investigate the relative lengths of the different stages of mitosis. The student prepared slides of cells isolated from a growing onion root tip and viewed the slides under a dissecting microscope. The student then made diagrams of cells that were in different stages of mitosis and counted the number of cells that were in each of those stages. The student’s data are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Number of cells in each of four different stages of mitosis\n\nBased on the data, the percent of the mitotic cells that were in metaphase is closest to which of the following?",
