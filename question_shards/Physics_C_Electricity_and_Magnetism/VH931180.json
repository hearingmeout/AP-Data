    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nRobert Frost’s poem “Mending Wall” was first published in 1914.\n\nMending Wall\n\nSomething there is that doesn't love a wall,\n\nThat sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,\n\nAnd spills the upper boulders in the sun;\n\nAnd makes gaps even two can pass abreast.\n\n5The work of hunters is another thing:\n\nI have come after them and made repair\n\nWhere they have left not one stone on a stone,\n\nBut they would have the rabbit out of hiding,\n\nTo please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,\n\n10No one has seen them made or heard them made,\n\nBut at spring mending-time we find them there.\n\nI let my neighbor know beyond the hill;\n\nAnd on a day we meet to walk the line\n\nAnd set the wall between us once again.\n\n15We keep the wall between us as we go.\n\nTo each the boulders that have fallen to each.\n\nAnd some are loaves and some so nearly balls\n\nWe have to use a spell to make them balance:\n\n“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”\n\n20We wear our fingers rough with handling them.\n\nOh, just another kind of outdoor game,\n\nOne on a side. It comes to little more:\n\nThere where it is we do not need the wall:\n\nHe is all pine and I am apple orchard.\n\n25My apple trees will never get across\n\nAnd eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.\n\nHe only says, “Good fences make good neighbors.”\n\nSpring is the mischief in me, and I wonder\n\nIf I could put a notion in his head:\n\n30“Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it\n\nWhere there are cows? But here there are no cows.\n\nBefore I built a wall I'd ask to know\n\nWhat I was walling in or walling out,\n\nAnd to whom I was like to give offense.\n\n35Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\n\nThat wants it down.” I could say “Elves” to him,\n\nBut it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather\n\nHe said it for himself. I see him there\n\nBringing a stone grasped firmly by the top\n\n40In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.\n\nHe moves in darkness as it seems to me,\n\nNot of woods only and the shade of trees.\n\nHe will not go behind his father's saying,\n\nAnd he likes having thought of it so well\n\n45He says again, “Good fences make good neighbors.”",
