    "description": "Joslyn performed an experiment using a die with its faces numbered from 1 to 6. She rolled the die and recorded whether the 5 landed face up. She repeated the process many times and kept a cumulative record of the total number of rolls and the total number of 5s landing face up. The following table shows part of her record.",
    "question": "Total Number of Rolls Total Number of 5s 5 1 10 2 15 2 20 3 Suppose Joslyn could roll the die 10,000 times and keep a record of the total number of 5s landing face up in the 10,000 rolls. What would such a record illustrate?",
