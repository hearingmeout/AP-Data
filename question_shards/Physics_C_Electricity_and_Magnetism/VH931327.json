    "description": "A person’s blood glucose level fluctuates during the day, as represented in Figure 1. Two hormones, insulin and glucagon, are directly involved in regulating the blood glucose level to maintain a healthy level. Insulin acts to lower the blood glucose level, and glucagon acts to increase the blood glucose level.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Blood glucose fluctuations of an individual Which of the following best predicts what will happen to the blood glucose level if the person has another meal at 5 p.m.?",
