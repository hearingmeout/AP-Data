    "question": "Researchers grew seedlings of corn, Zea mays, in loose and compact sand. The researchers measured the amount of time required for the cells in the growing root tips of the seedlings to double in number. The mean cell doubling times for the two groups of seedlings are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Mean cell doubling times for the growing root tips of Zea mays seedlings planted in loose or compact sand\n\nBased on the sample means, which of the following conclusions about the cells in the growing root tips of Zea mays seedlings is best supported by the results of the experiment?",
