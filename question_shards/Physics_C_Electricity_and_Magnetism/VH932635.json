    "question": "A researcher claims that some bacteria contain factors that influence the function of a particular enzyme but other bacteria do not. To test the claim experimentally, the researcher will grow two different bacterial strains in separate liquid cultures and isolate the contents of the cells in each culture. The researcher will add different combinations of cellular contents, substrate, and enzyme to test tubes containing a buffer solution adjusted to the optimal <math alttext=\"p H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> of the enzyme and then measure the rate of product formation. The design of the researcher’s experiment is presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. An experiment for investigating the influence of bacterial factors on enzyme function\n\nTest Tube \nSource of Cellular Contents \nCellular Contents Added \nSubstrate Added \nEnzyme Added \n\n1 \nStrain 1 \nNo \nYes \nYes \n\n2\nStrain 1\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n3 \nStrain 1 \nYes \nYes \nNo \n\n4 \nStrain 1 \nYes \nYes \nYes \n\n5 \nStrain 2 \nNo \nYes \nYes \n\n6 \nStrain 2 \nYes\nNo \nYes \n\n7 \nStrain 2 \nYes \nYes \nNo \n\n8\nStrain 2\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\nWhich of the following statements best justifies the inclusion of test tubes 3 and 7 in the experiment?",
