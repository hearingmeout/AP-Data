    "question": "This question is based on the accompanying documents. The documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise. In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least three documents. Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. Evaluate the extent to which demand for industrial resources, including rubber, shaped European imperialism in the late nineteenth century. Historical Background: Natural rubber is made from the sap of several species of trees and vines that grow in the wild in tropical rain forests. In the late nineteenth century, as demand for rubber rapidly increased, the Amazon Basin in South America and the Congo Basin in central Africa emerged as the main rubber-producing regions in the world.",
