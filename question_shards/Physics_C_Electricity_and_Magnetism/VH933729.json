They hire an environmental consulting company to perform a study to determine if this is true.

The characteristics of the land in both plots are identical except that plot <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is covered by agricultural fields and plot <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is covered by undisturbed forest. Rain gauges are set up at the up-slope edge of the plots, and devices that collect eroded soil are set up along the down-slope edge of the plots. The environmental consultants hypothesize that more soil will be eroded from plot <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> than from plot <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>.
