    "question": "A researcher claims that genetic variation provides organisms with the ability to survive and reproduce in different environments. To support the claim, the researcher makes the following observation: bacteria that contain plasmids (small <math alttext=\"D N A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>DNA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> molecules) are resistant to a wider range of antibiotics than are bacteria that contain no plasmids.\nWhich of the following statements best establishes a connection between the observation and the researcher’s claim?",
