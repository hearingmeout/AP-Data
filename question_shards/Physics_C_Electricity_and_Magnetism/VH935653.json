    "description": "The Next Green Revolution\nHalf a century ago disaster loomed just as ominously (as today). Speaking about global hunger in 1959, one economist said, “At best the world outlook for the decades ahead is grave; at worst it is frightening.”\nBefore those visions could come to pass, the green revolution transformed global agriculture, especially wheat and rice. [S]elective breeding created a dwarf variety of wheat that put most of its energy into edible kernels rather than long, inedible stems. The result: more grain per acre. Similar work in the Philippines dramatically improved the productivity of the grain that feeds nearly half the world. From the 1960s through the 1990s, yields of rice and wheat in Asia doubled.\nTo keep doing that between now and 2050, we’ll need another green revolution. There are two competing visions of how it will happen. One is high-tech, with a heavy emphasis on continuing breeding better crops, but with modern genetic techniques. “The next green revolution will supercharge the tools of the old one.” Scientists, he argues, can now identify and manipulate a huge variety of plant genes, for traits like disease resistance and drought tolerance. That’s going to make farming more productive and resilient.\nThe signature technology of this approach—and the one that has brought both success and controversy to Monsanto—is genetically modified, or <math alttext=\"G M\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>GM</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, crops.
