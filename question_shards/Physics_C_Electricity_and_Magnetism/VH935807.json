    "description": "A recent survey indicated that the mean time spent on a music streaming service is 210 minutes per week for the population of a certain country. A simulation was conducted to create a sampling distribution of the sample mean for a population with a mean of 210. The following histogram shows the results of the simulation.",
    "question": "Which of the following would be the best reason why the simulation of the sampling distribution is not approximately normal?",
