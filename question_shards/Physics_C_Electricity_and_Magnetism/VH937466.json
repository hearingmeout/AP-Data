    "question": "In a certain signal transduction pathway, the binding of an extracellular molecule to a cell-surface protein results in a rapid increase in the concentration of cyclic <math alttext=\"A M P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>AMP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> inside the cell. The cyclic <math alttext=\"A M P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>AMP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> binds to and activates cytosolic enzymes that then activate other enzymes in the cell.\nWhich of the following statements best describes the role of cyclic <math alttext=\"A M P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>AMP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> in the signal transduction pathway?",
