    "question": "Figure 1 is a proposed model of the feedback system controlling erythrocyte (red blood cell) production.\n\nFigure 1. Model of erythrocyte production control\n\nAir is less dense at very high elevations, so less oxygen is available than in the denser air at sea level. Based on the model in Figure 1, if a person travels from sea level to a high elevation location, which of the following correctly predicts the response to the decreased blood oxygen level?",
