    "description": "An advertisement firm reports that the proportion of consumers who respond favorably to a certain advertisement is 0.70. Three simulations, A, B, and C, were designed to create a sampling distribution of a sample proportion from a population with proportion 0.70. Each simulation consisted of 2,500 trials. For each trial of a simulation, a sample of size <math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> was selected at random, and the sample proportion was recorded. The value of <math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> varied among the simulations. The following histograms summarize the results of the simulations.",
    "question": "Which of the following lists the simulations in order from the least sample size <math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to the greatest sample size <math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> ?",
