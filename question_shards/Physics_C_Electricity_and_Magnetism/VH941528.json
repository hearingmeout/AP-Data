    "question": "The beta-2 adrenergic receptor is a membrane-bound protein that regulates several cellular processes, including the synthesis and breakdown of glycogen. The receptor binds specifically to the hormone epinephrine. The binding of epinephrine to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor triggers a signal transduction cascade that controls glycogen synthesis and breakdown in the cell. A simplified model of the signal transduction cascade is represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. A simplified model of the signal transduction cascade triggered by epinephrine binding to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor\n\nWhich of the following outcomes will most likely result from the inactivation of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor?",
