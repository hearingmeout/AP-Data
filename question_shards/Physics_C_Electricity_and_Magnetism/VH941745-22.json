Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. Growth hormone and insulin are protein hormones that regulate carbohydrate metabolism by hepatocytes (liver cells) through the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Researchers investigated whether the two hormones trigger the same or different intracellular signaling pathways in hepatocytes. The researchers added either growth hormone or insulin to parallel cultures of hepatocytes. At several time points after the hormone addition, they purified total intracellular protein from the cells and quantified the level of the phosphorylated forms of two proteins involved in two different signaling pathways (Figure 1, <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>). Figure 1. The level of phosphorylated signaling proteins STAT5 (A) and protein kinase B (B) in cells cultured in the presence of growth hormone or insulin (a) Describe the first interaction that triggers signaling to begin in a target cell.",
