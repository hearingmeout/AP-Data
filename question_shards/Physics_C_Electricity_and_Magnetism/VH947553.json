    "description": "In William Shakespeare’s Sonnet 29, published in 1609, the speaker contemplates the value of love. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Shakespeare uses literary elements and techniques to convey the complex interaction between self-esteem and love.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\n1 When in disgrace with Fortune and men’s eyes\n\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\n\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless1useless cries,\n\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\n\n5 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,\n\nFeatur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,\n\nDesiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,2breadth of knowledge\n\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\n\nYet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\n\n10 Haply I think on thee, and then my state\n\n(Like to the lark3a kind of songbird at break of day arising\n\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate,\n\nFor thy sweet love rememb’red such wealth brings,\n\nThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.",
