    "description": "In the following poem by William Carlos Williams (published in 1921), the speaker describes a scene from a day in late winter. Read the poem carefully. Write a paragraph in which you make a defensible claim about how Williams uses poetic elements and techniques to convey the speaker’s complex perspective on the approach of spring. In your paragraph, you should incorporate at least one piece of evidence from the text to support your claim.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nConstruct a claim that presents an interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to develop and support your interpretation.\n\nExplain the relationship between the evidence and your interpretation.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nSpring and All\n\nBy the road to the contagious hospital\n\nunder the surge of the blue\n\nmottled clouds driven from the\n\nnortheast—a cold wind. Beyond, the\n\n(5)   waste of broad, muddy fields\n\nbrown with dried weeds, standing and fallen\n\npatches of standing water\n\nthe scattering of tall trees\n\nAll along the road the reddish\n\n(10)   purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy\n\nstuff of bushes and small trees\n\nwith dead, brown leaves under them\n\nleafless vines—\n\nLifeless in appearance, sluggish\n\n(15)   dazed spring approaches—\n\nThey enter the new world naked,\n\ncold, uncertain of all\n\nsave that they enter. All about them\n\nthe cold, familiar wind—\n(20)   \n\nNow the grass, tomorrow\n\nthe stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf\n\nOne by one objects are defined—\n\nIt quickens: clarity, outline of leaf\n\nBut now the stark dignity of\n\n(25)   entrance—Still, the profound change\n\nhas come upon them: rooted, they\n\ngrip down and begin to awaken",
