    "description": "A large company offered gym memberships to its employees as part of a program to keep employees healthy. A random sample of employees with a gym membership and a random sample of employees without a gym membership were taken, and the proportion of employees who had taken at least one sick day in the past month was recorded for each sample. A 90 percent confidence interval for the difference in population proportions (membership minus no membership) was found to be <math alttext=\"negative 0.13 comma 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.13</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
    "question": "Employees believe that there is no difference in absenteeism between those with a gym membership and those without a gym membership. Does the confidence interval provide evidence that this belief is plausible?",
