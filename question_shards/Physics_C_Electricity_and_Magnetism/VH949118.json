    "question": "A small negatively charged sphere is traveling horizontally with speed <math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to the right when it enters the region between two parallel, oppositely charged plates. Assume the electric field is negligible outside the region between the plates. The sphere enters the region between the plates at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> and exits the region at <math alttext=\"t equals t sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>. Which of the following pairs of graphs depicts the horizontal and vertical positions as functions of time for the particle while the particle is in the region between the plates and for a short time after the particle leaves this region? Use the coordinate system indicated in the figure and assume the effects of gravity are negligible.",
