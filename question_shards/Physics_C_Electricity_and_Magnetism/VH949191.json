    "question": "Isolated spheres 1 and 2 both carry positive charge <math alttext=\"q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"italic\"><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, but sphere 2 has more mass than sphere 1. The objects are released from rest when they are a distance <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></math> apart and accelerate away from each other. Let <math alttext=\"U\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow></math> be the electric potential energy of the system of two spheres, and <math alttext=\"K sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math> and <math alttext=\"K sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math> be the kinetic energies of sphere 1 and sphere 2, respectively. Which of the following pairs of energy bar charts could represent the distribution of the energies in the system when the spheres are first released and the distribution of energies when the spheres are a large distance away from each other?",
