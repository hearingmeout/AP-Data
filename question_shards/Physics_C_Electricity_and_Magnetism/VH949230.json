    "description": "A political scientist claims that negative advertising on television affects younger voters more than it affects older voters. To test this claim, the scientist obtained data from two random samples of voters categorized into two age-groups, older and younger. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the proportions of voters in the two age-groups who would be affected by negative ads. The alternative hypothesis was that the proportion of younger voters affected would be greater than the proportion of older voters affected.",
    "question": "Assuming all conditions for inference were met, the scientist conducted the test at a significance level of <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. The resulting <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value was 0.206.
