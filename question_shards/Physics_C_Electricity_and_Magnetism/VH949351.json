    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nA. E. Stallings’ poem “Sestina: Like” was originally published in 2013.\n\nSestina: Like\n\nWith a nod to Jonah Winter\n\n1 Now we’re all “friends,” there is no love but Like,\n\nA semi-demi goddess, something like\n\nA reality-TV star look-alike,\n\nNamed Simile or Me Two. So we like\n\n5 In order to be liked. It isn’t like\n\nThere’s Love or Hate now. Even plain “dislike”\n\nIs frowned on: there’s no button for it. Like\n\nIs something you can quantify: each “like”\n\nYou gather’s almost something money-like,\n\n10 Token of virtual support. “Please like\n\nThis page to stamp out hunger.” And you’d like\n\nTo end hunger and climate change alike,\n\nBut it’s unlikely Like does diddly. Like\n\nJust twiddles its unopposing thumbs-ups, like-\n\n15 Wise props up scarecrow silences. “I’m like,\n\nSo OVER him,” I overhear. “But, like,\n\nHe doesn’t get it. Like, you know? He’s like\n\nIt’s all OK. Like I don’t even LIKE\n\nHim anymore. Whatever. I’m all like ... ”\n\n20 Take “like” out of our chat, we’d all alike\n\nFlounder, agape, gesticulating1gesturing excitedly like\n\nA foreign film sans2without subtitles, fall like\n\nDumb phones to mooted desuetude3a state of disuse. Unlike\n\nWith other crutches, um, when we use “like,”\n\n25 We’re not just buying time on credit: Like\n\nDisplaces other words; crowds, cuckoo-like,\n\nEndangered hatchlings from the nest. (Click “like”\n\nIf you’re against extinction!) Like is like\n\nInvasive zebra mussels, or it’s like\n\n30 Those nutria-things, or kudzu, or belike\n\nRedundant fast food franchises, each like\n\n(More like) the next. Those poets who dislike\n\nInversions, archaisms, who just like\n\nPlain English as she’s spoke — why isn’t “like”\n\n35 Their (literally) every other word? I’d like\n\nUs just to admit that’s what real speech is like.\n\nBut as you like, my friend. Yes, we’re alike,\n\nHow we pronounce, say, lichen, and dislike\n\nCancer and war. So like this page.
