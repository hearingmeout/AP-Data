    "description": "Machines at a factory produce circular washers with a specified diameter. The quality control manager at the factory periodically tests a random sample of washers to be sure that greater than 90 percent of the washers are produced with the specified diameter. The null hypothesis of the test is that the proportion of all washers produced with the specified diameter is equal to 90 percent. The alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of all washers produced with the specified diameter is greater than 90 percent.",
