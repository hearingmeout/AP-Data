    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nNatasha Trethewey’s poem “Letter Home” was originally published in 2000.\n\nLetter Home\n\n—New Orleans, November 1910\n\nFour weeks have passed since I left, and still\n\nI must write to you of no work. I’ve worn down\n\nthe soles and walked through the tightness\n\nof my new shoes, calling upon the merchants,\n\n5 their offices bustling. All the while I kept thinking\n\nmy plain English and good writing would secure\n\nfor me some modest position. Though I dress each day\n\nin my best, hands covered with the lace gloves\n\nyou crocheted—no one needs a girl. How flat\n\n10the word sounds, and heavy. My purse thins.\n\nI spend foolishly to make an appearance of quiet\n\nindustry, to mask the desperation that tightens\n\nmy throat. I sit watching—\n\nthough I pretend not to notice—the dark maids\n\n15ambling by with their white charges. Do I deceive\n\nanyone? Were they to see my hands, brown\n\nas your dear face, they’d know I’m not quite\n\nwhat I pretend to be. I walk these streets\n\na white woman, or so I think, until I catch the eyes\n\n20of some stranger upon me, and I must lower mine,\n\na negress again. There are enough things here\n\nto remind me who I am. Mules lumbering through\n\nthe crowded streets send me into reverie, their footfall\n\nthe sound of a pointer and chalk hitting the blackboard\n\n25at school, only louder. Then there are women, clicking\n\ntheir tongues in conversation, carrying their loads\n\non their heads. Their husky voices, the wash pots\n\nand irons of the laundresses call to me. Here,\n\nI thought not to do the work I once did, back-bending\n\n30and domestic; my schooling a gift—even those half days\n\nat picking time, listening to Miss J—. How\n\nI’d come to know words, the recitations I practiced\n\nto sound like her, lilting, my sentences curling up\n\nor trailing off at the ends. I read my books until\n\n35I nearly broke their spines, and in the cotton field\n\nI repeated whole sections I’d learned by heart,\n\nspelling each word in my head to make a picture\n\nI could see, as well as a weight I could feel\n\nin my mouth. So now, even as I write this\n\n40and think of you at home, Good-bye\n\nis the waving map of your palm, is\n\na stone on my tongue.\nNatasha Trethewey, “Letter Home” from Bellocq’s Ophelia.
