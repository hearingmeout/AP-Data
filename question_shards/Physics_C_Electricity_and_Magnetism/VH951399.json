    "question": "A small sphere with charge <math alttext=\"positive lowercase q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is used to test the electric field produced by the relatively large charge <math alttext=\"positive uppercase Q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> found on the surface of the sphere of a Van de Graaff generator. The small sphere experiences an electrostatic repulsion force <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> due to its interaction with the large sphere. In different trials, the charge <math alttext=\"positive lowercase q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is increased, the small sphere is placed the same distance from the large surface, and the resulting force <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is measured. Which of the following graphs best represents <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"lowercase q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> ?",
