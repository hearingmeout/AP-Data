    "question": "A marketing agency selected a random sample of television viewers to test the claim that the proportion of viewers who watch a particular show is less than 0.20 at a level of significance of 0.05. The test yielded a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.47.
