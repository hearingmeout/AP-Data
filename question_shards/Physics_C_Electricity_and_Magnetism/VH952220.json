    "question": "Sue and Javier are working on a statistics project to estimate the proportion of students at their school who have a pet dog. Sue selects a random sample of 81 students from the 2,400 students at their school, and Javier selects a separate random sample of 64 students. They will both construct a 90 percent confidence interval from their estimates. Consider the situation in which the sample proportion from Sue’s sample is equal to the sample proportion from Javier’s sample. Which of the following statements correctly describes their intervals?",
