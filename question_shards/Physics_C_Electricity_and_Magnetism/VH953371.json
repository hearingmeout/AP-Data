    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nAugusta Cooper Bristol’s poem “Night” was published in 1895.\n\nNight\n\n1 I stood and watched the still, mysterious Night,\n\nSteal from her shadowy caverns in the East,\n\nTo work her deep enchantments on the world.\n\nHer black veil floated down the silent glens,\n\n5 While her dark sandalled feet, with noiseless tread,\n\nMoved to a secret harmony. Along\n\nThe brows of the majestic hills, she strung\n\nHer glorious diamonds so stealthily,\n\nIt never marred their dreams; and in the deep,\n\n10Cool thickets of the wood, where scarce the Day\n\nCould reach the dim retreat, her dusky hand\n\nPinned on the breast of the exhaling flower,\n\nA glittering gem; while all the tangled ferns\n\nAnd forest lace-work, as she moved along,\n\n15Grew moist and shining.\n\nWho would e’er have guessed,\n\nThe queenly Night would deign to stoop and love\n\nA little flower! And yet, with all her stealth,\n\nI saw her press her damp and cooling lip\n\n20Upon the feverish bosom of a Rose;\n\nAt which a watchful bird poured sudden forth\n\nA love-sick song, of sweet and saddest strain.\n\nUpon the ivied rocks, and rugged crags\n\nOn which the ocean billows break, she hung\n\n25Her sombre mantle; and the gray old sea\n\nThat had been high in tumult all the day,\n\nBecame so mesmerized beneath her wiles,\n\nHe seemed a mere reflection of herself.\n\nThe billows sank into a dimpled sleep;\n\n30Only the little tide-waves glided up\n\nTo kiss the blackness of the airy robe\n\nThat floated o’er them.\n\nLong I stood and watched\n\nThe mystic, spell-like influence of Night;\n\n35Till o’er the eastern hills, came up the first\n\nFaint glories of the crown that Phoebus*another name for Apollo, a Greek god associated with the sun. wears.\n\nAnd soon, the Earth, surprised to see the work\n\nThat Night had wrought, began to glow and blush,\n\nLike maidens, conscious of the glance of Love.\n\n40While she, — the dark Enchantress, — like to one\n\nWho decorates her bower with all things fair,\n\nWherewith to please her lover, but yet flees\n\nAt his approaching step, — at the first gleam\n\nThat lit the zenith from the Day-god’s eye,\n\n45Fled timid o’er the distant western hills.",
