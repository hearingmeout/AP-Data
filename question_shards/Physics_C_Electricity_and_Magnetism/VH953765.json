    "description": "Read the following passage carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nIn James Weldon Johnson’s poem “A Poet to His Baby Son,” published in 1935, the speaker addresses his infant son.\n\nA Poet to His Baby Son\n\nTiny bit of humanity,\n\nBlessed with your mother’s face,\n\nAnd cursed with your father’s mind.\n\nI say cursed with your father’s mind,\n\n5Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back,\n\nPlaying with the dimpled big toe of your left foot,\n\nAnd looking away,\n\nThrough the ceiling of the room, and beyond.\n\nCan it be that already you are thinking of being a poet?\n\n10Why don’t you kick and howl,\n\nAnd make the neighbors talk about\n\n“That damned baby next door,”\n\nAnd make up your mind forthwith\n\nTo grow up and be a banker\n\n15Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter\n\nOr—?—whatever you decide upon,\n\nRid yourself of these incipient1in a beginning stage thoughts\n\nAbout being a poet.\n\nFor poets no longer are makers of songs,\n\n20Chanters of the gold and purple harvest,\n\nSayers of the glories of earth and sky,\n\nOf the sweet pain of love\n\nAnd the keen joy of living;\n\nNo longer dreamers of the essential dreams,\n\n25And interpreters of the eternal truth,\n\nThrough the eternal beauty.\n\nPoets these days are unfortunate fellows.\n\nBaffled in trying to say old things in a new way\n\nOr new things in an old language,\n\n30They talk abracadabra\n\nIn an unknown tongue,\n\nEach one fashioning for himself\n\nA wordy world of shadow problems,\n\nAnd as a self-imagined Atlas,2As a punishment for battling against the Greek gods, Atlas was ordered to carry the sky on his shoulders for eternity.\n\n35Struggling under it with puny legs and arms,\n\nGroaning out incoherent complaints at his load.\n\nMy son, this is no time nor place for a poet;\n\nGrow up and join the big, busy crowd\n\nThat scrambles for what it thinks it wants\n\n40Out of this old world which is—as it is—\n\nAnd, probably, always will be.\n\nTake the advice of a father who knows:\n\nYou cannot begin too young\n\nNot to be a poet.",
