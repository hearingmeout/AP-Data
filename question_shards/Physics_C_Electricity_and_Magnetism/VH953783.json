    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nSarah Morgan Bryan Piatt’s poem “Giving Back the Flower” was published in 1867, two years after the end of the American Civil War.\n\nGiving Back the Flower\n\n1 So, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night,\n\nAnd to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair,\n\nTill your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight,\n\nAnd to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,\n\n5Say, must you taunt me forever, forever? You looked at my hand and you knew\n\nThat I was the slave of the Ring, while you were as free as the wind is free.\n\nWhen I saw your corpse in your coffin, I flung back your flower to you;\n\nIt was all of yours that I ever had; you may keep it, and—keep from me.\n\nAh? so God is your witness. Has God, then, no world to look after but ours?\n\n10May He not have been searching for that wild star, with the trailing plumage, that flew\n\nFar over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers,\n\nOr else brightening some planet’s luminous rings, instead of thinking of you?\n\nOr, if He was near us at all, do you think that He would sit listening there\n\nBecause you sang “Hear me, Norma,” to a woman in jewels and lace,\n\n15While, so close to us, down in another street, in the wet, unlighted air,\n\nThere were children crying for bread and fire, and mothers who questioned His grace?\n\nOr perhaps He had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day,\n\nTo number the bloody stabs that were there, to look at and judge the dead;\n\nOr else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay;\n\n20At least I do not believe that He cares to remember a word that you said.\n\nSo take back your flower, I tell you—of its sweetness I now have no need;\n\nYes; take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep;\n\nWhen you wake I will take it, and God, then, perhaps will witness indeed,\n\nBut go, now, and tell Death he must watch you, and not let you walk in your sleep.",
