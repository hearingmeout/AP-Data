    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nRichard Wilbur’s poem “Lightness” was published in a collection that appeared in 1947.\n\nLightness\n\nA birdsnest built on the palm of the high-\n\nMost bough of an elm, this morning as I came by\n\nA brute gust lifted-and-left in the midst of the air;\n\nWhereat the leaves went quiet, and there\n\n5Was a moment of silence in honor of\n\nThe sweetness of danger. The chalice now bobbing above,\n\nOf interlaid daintiest timber, began the chute\n\nDown forty fell feet toward stone and root\n\nWith a drift and a sampan1a flat-bottomed boat spin, and gripped\n\n10Loosely its fine shelled life; now viciously tipped\n\nBy a ripple of air, with an acrobat’s quick not-quite-\n\nLost, dipped lower to whirl upright;\n\nThen, with a straight-down settling, it\n\nDescended into sunshine, and, with a hushed touch, lit\n\n15On a mesa of strenuous grass. Oh risk-hallowed eggs, oh\n\nTriumph of lightness! Legerity2lightness in movement or action; mental quickness begs no\n\nQuarter: my Aunt Virginia, when\n\nShe’d relapsed and recovered, would sit in the garden again\n\nWaiting, all lapped in an indigo-flowered shawl,\n\n20In white for her “regular customers” call;\n\nWhose pity she parried with very-blue-eyed\n\nAttention, and giggled and patted their hands when they tried\n\nTo do-something-for-her; she sat in the heart of her days\n\nAnd watched with a look of peculiar praise;\n\n25Her slight voice could catch a pleasure complete\n\nAs a gull takes a fish at the flash of his side. Her great\n\nHeavy husband adored her, would treat with a sudden blind sally\n\nOf softness his “visitor from the valley”;\n\nHe called her “Birdie,” which was good, for him.\n\n30And he and the others, the strong, the involved, in-the-swim,\n\nSeeing her there in the garden, in her gray shroud\n\nAs vague and as self-possessed as a cloud,\n\nRequiring nothing of them any more,\n\nAnd one hand lightly laid on a fatal door,\n\n35Thought of the health of the sick, and, what mocked their sighing,\n\nOf the strange intactness of the gladly dying.\n“Lightness” from THE BEAUTIFUL CHANGES AND OTHER POEMS by Richard Wilbur.
