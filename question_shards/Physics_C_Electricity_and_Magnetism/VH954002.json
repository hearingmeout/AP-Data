    "description": "The epinephrine signaling pathway plays a role in regulating glucose homeostasis in muscle cells. The signaling pathway is activated by the binding of epinephrine to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor. A simplified model of the epinephrine signaling pathway is represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. A simplified model of the epinephrine signaling pathway in muscle cells",
    "question": "Based on Figure 1, which of the following statements best describes the epinephrine signaling pathway?",
