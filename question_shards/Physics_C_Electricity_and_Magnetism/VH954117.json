    "description": "Many works of literature feature a character who is sick or dying. That character’s illness or mortality can affect other characters and may serve as a symbol for a larger idea.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list to the left, choose a work of fiction in which a character is sick or dying. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the symbolism of the character’s illness or mortality contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents an interpretation and may establish a line of reasoning.\n\nSelect and use evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain the relationship between the evidence and your thesis.\n\nAll the Pretty Horses\n\nAs I Lay Dying\n\nThe Bell Jar\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nCeremony\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nDracula\n\nExit West\n\nThe Friend: A Novel\n\nA Farewell to Arms\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nJane Eyre\n\nThe Joy Luck Club\n\nKing Lear\n\nA Lesson Before Dying\n\nLittle Fires Everywhere\n\nLittle Women\n\nLong Day’s Journey Into Night\n\nNervous Conditions\n\nNever Let Me Go\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four\n\nOryx and Crake\n\nPurple Hibiscus\n\nPush\n\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\n\nSaturday\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nSing, Unburied, Sing\n\nStation 11\n\nThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\nSula\n\nSwing Time\n\nThe Sympathizer\n\nA Thousand Specific Suns\n\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nTwain & Stanley Enter Paradise\n\nWhen Breath Becomes Air\n\nWit\n\nWuthering Heights",
