Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A geologist studying lead concentration in soil selected random samples of soil from two regions: region A and region B. The following histograms show the distribution of lead concentration, in parts per million (<math alttext=\"p p m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ppm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math>), for the two samples. (a) Write a few sentences comparing the distributions of lead concentration in the two samples.(b) To investigate whether the mean lead concentration is different in region A than in region B, the geologist conducted the appropriate test.
