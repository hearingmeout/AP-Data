    "question": "Researchers hypothesized that red eye color in Japanese koi, a type of fish, is due to a mutation. To study the inheritance of red eye color in koi, the researchers conducted breeding experiments over several generations. The results are summarized in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Inheritance of eye color in Japanese koi\n\nBased on the data in Figure 1, which of the following is the best prediction of the mode of inheritance of red eyes in Japanese koi?",
