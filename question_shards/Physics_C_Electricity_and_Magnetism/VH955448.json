    "question": "In corn plants, purple kernel color is dominant to yellow kernel color, and smooth kernels are dominant to wrinkled kernels. Researchers carried out a genetics experiment to investigate whether the genes controlling kernel color and kernel texture segregate independently. In their experiment, the researchers crossed two corn plants that were each heterozygous for both kernel color and kernel texture. The results of the experiment are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.
