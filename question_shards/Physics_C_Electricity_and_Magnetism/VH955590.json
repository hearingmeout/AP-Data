    "description": "When a mustard plant seedling is transferred to an environment with higher levels of carbon dioxide, the new leaves have a lower stomata-to-surface-area ratio than do the seedling’s original leaves.",

    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Increased photosynthesis leads to larger leaves that need more stomata for photosynthesis, leading to an increase in stomatal density.",
