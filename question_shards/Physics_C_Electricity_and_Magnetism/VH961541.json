    "question": "Trisomy 21 is a condition in which a child is born with an extra chromosome in pair 21. Researchers assessed the frequency of children born with trisomy 21 by age of the mothers at birth (maternal age) and primary cause of the error leading to trisomy 21. The findings are presented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Incidence and primary cause of trisomy 21 by maternal age-group\n\nBased on the data in Figure 1, which of the following is most likely the primary cause of the pattern of frequency of trisomy 21 births in the selected maternal age-groups?",
