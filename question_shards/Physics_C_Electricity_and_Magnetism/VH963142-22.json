A neutral, solid, spherical conductor with a radius of <math alttext=\"uppercase R\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is placed on an insulated stand as shown. Students are to perform an experiment to investigate the behavior of charge on this conductor. In order to charge the conductor, one student brings a positively charged rod close to the conductor, and another student connects a grounding wire to the opposite side of the conductor. The student then takes the wire away. The rod is also taken away. (a) After the above procedure, what will be the sign of the charge on the sphere? Positive Negative Justify your answer.",
