    "question": "The coagulation cascade controls blood clot formation in response to blood vessel injury. Thrombin is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating the coagulation cascade. A simplified model of thrombin’s role in regulating the coagulation cascade is represented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. A simplified model of thrombin’s role in regulating the coagulation cascade\n\nArgatroban is a competitive inhibitor of thrombin. Which of the following effects on the coagulation cascade is most likely to result from inhibiting thrombin activity with argatroban?",
