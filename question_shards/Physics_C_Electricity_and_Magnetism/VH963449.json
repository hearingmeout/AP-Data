    "question": "In its 2003 decision, McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003), the Supreme Court upheld the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act’s (BCRA) restriction on independent campaign spending by corporations and unions. However, in a 5-4 decision in the case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), the Supreme Court overturned this decision when it ruled that the government cannot ban independent political spending by a corporation or union because it is protected by the First Amendment.\nWhich of the following is the most likely explanation for the Supreme Court’s deciding to overturn the precedent it established just 7 years earlier?",
