    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nTheodore Roethke’s poem “In a Dark Time” was published in 1964.\n\nIn a Dark Time\n\n1 In a dark time, the eye begins to see,\n\nI meet my shadow in the deepening shade;\n\nI hear my echo in the echoing wood—\n\nA lord of nature weeping to a tree.\n\n5 I live between the heron and the wren,\n\nBeasts of the hill and serpents of the den.\n\nWhat’s madness but nobility of soul\n\nAt odds with circumstance? The day’s on fire!\n\nI know the purity of pure despair,\n\n10 My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.\n\nThat place among the rocks—is it a cave,\n\nOr winding path? The edge is what I have.\n\nA steady storm of correspondences!\n\nA night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,\n\n15 And in broad day the midnight come again!\n\nA man goes far to find out what he is—\n\nDeath of the self in a long, tearless night,\n\nAll natural shapes blazing unnatural light.\n\nDark, dark my light, and darker my desire.\n\n20 My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,\n\nKeeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I ?\n\nA fallen man, I climb out of my fear.\n\nThe mind enters itself, and God the mind,\n\nAnd one is One, free in the tearing wind.\n\"In A Dark Time,\" copyright © 1960 by Beatrice Roethke, Administratrix of the Estate of Theodore Roethke, copyright © 1966 and renewed 1994 by Beatrice Lushington; from COLLECTED POEMS by Theodore Roethke.
