    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem, “The Collar,” written by an Anglican priest, was published in 1633.\n\nThe Collar1The title refers to the clerical collar worn by priests.\n\n1 I struck the board, and cried, “No more;\n\nI will abroad!\n\nWhat? shall I ever sigh and pine?\n\nMy lines and life are free, free as the road,\n\n5 Loose as the wind, as large as store.\n\nShall I be still in suit?\n\nHave I no harvest but a thorn\n\nTo let me blood, and not restore\n\nWhat I have lost with cordial fruit?\n\n10 Sure there was wine\n\nBefore my sighs did dry it; there was corn\n\nBefore my tears did drown it.\n\nIs the year only lost to me?\n\nHave I no bays to crown it,\n\n15 No flowers, no garlands gay? All blasted?\n\nAll wasted?\n\nNot so, my heart; but there is fruit,\n\nAnd thou hast hands.\n\nRecover all thy sigh-blown age\n\n20 On double pleasures: leave thy cold dispute\n\nOf what is fit and not. Forsake thy cage,\n\nThy rope of sands,\n\nWhich petty thoughts have made, and made to thee\n\nGood cable, to enforce and draw,\n\n25And be thy law,\n\nWhile thou didst wink and wouldst not see.\n\nAway! take heed;\n\nI will abroad.\n\nCall in thy death’s-head there; tie up thy fears;\n\n30 He that forbears\n\nTo suit and serve his need\n\nDeserves his load.”\n\nBut as I raved and grew more fierce and wild\n\nAt every word,\n\n35 Methought I heard one calling, Child!\n\nAnd I replied, My Lord.",
