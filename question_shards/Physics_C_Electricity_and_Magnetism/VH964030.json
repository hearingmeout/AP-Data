    "question": "Rubber rabbitbrush plants display heritable variation in plant height and insect-induced gall formation. In a field study, researchers investigated the relationship between plant height and gall number for the rubber rabbitbrush plants in a natural population. The researchers used the data they collected to perform a chi-square test of independence. The null hypothesis for the chi-square test was that plant height and gall number are independent. The data for the chi-square test are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Data for the chi-square test of independence\n\nHeight Category <math alttext=\"in centimeters\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>(cm)</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> \nNumber of Plants with Ten or Fewer Galls \nNumber of Plants with More than Ten Galls \n\n0–30 \n34 \n6 \n\n31–60 \n22 \n16 \n\n61–90 \n14 \n21 \n\n91–120 \n10 \n27 \n\nThe researchers calculated a chi-square value of 29.25. If there are three degrees of freedom and the significance level is <math alttext=\"p equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, which of the following statements best completes the chi-square test?",
