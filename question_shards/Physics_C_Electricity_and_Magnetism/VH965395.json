    "description": "Cycloheximide <math alttext=\"or C H X\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>CHX</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> is a eukaryote protein synthesis inhibitor. It is used in biomedical research to inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells studied in vitro. Its effects are rapidly reversed by simply removing it from the culture medium.",
    "question": "In a translation experiment using a fungus culture, radiolabeled amino acids were added to the culture, allowing the researchers to measure the growth of a single polypeptide chain by measuring counts per minute <math alttext=\"or C P M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>CPM</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>. As the chain grew, the <math alttext=\"C P M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>CPM</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> increased. After a certain amount of time, <math alttext=\"C H X\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>CHX</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> was added to the mixture, and the experiment continued. After an additional amount of time, the <math alttext=\"C H X\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>CHX</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> was removed from the culture medium. Which of the following graphs best predicts the data collected during the experiment?",
