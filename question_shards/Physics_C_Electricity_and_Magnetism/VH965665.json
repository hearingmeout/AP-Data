Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.\n\nIn many countries, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting the parasite that causes malaria to people through their bites. A primary tool for mosquito control is the use of insecticidal nets sprayed with chemicals known as pyrethroids, which are relatively safe for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However, mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has now become widespread. Pyrethroids interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells of the mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino acid position 1014. Scientists hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic drawing of the transmembrane sodium channel targeted by pyrethroids and other insecticides. The arrow points to the position of amino acid 1014.\n\nTo investigate pyrethroid resistance, mosquitoes were collected four times over a two-year period from the following two regions.\n\nRegion A: a southern vegetable-growing region where large amounts of insecticide are applied for crop protection\n\nRegion B: a northern rice-growing region where very little insecticide is applied for rice protection\n\nScientists exposed the collected mosquitoes to filter papers soaked in two different pyrethroid insecticides, deltamethrin and permethrin, and the percent mortality of the mosquitoes was determined after 24 hours (Figure 2).
