    "question": "Scientists are interested in determining the average number of species that have migrated from the mainland to a group of islands, as shown below. Partway through their study, they decided to include an additional island in their study group.\n\nBased on the theory of island biogeography, which of the following best explains how the scientists’ calculation of average number of species would change with the inclusion of this new island in their study?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The average would increase because more species would have migrated directly to the farther island.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The average would decrease because fewer species would have migrated directly to the farther island.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The average would not change because it is likely that the additional island has about the same number of species that migrated as the original island group.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The average would not change because the island is approximately the same size as those in the original group and therefore just as likely to recruit species from the mainland.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The average would decrease because fewer species would have migrated directly to the farther island."
