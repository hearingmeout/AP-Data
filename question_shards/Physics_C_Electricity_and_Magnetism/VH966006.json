    "description": "Figure 1. Phytoplankton biomass in two sides of a small lake that is divided by an impermeable curtain\n\nIn the early 1970s, researchers hypothesized that carbon was the limiting nutrient in many aquatic ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, the researchers divided a small lake in two roughly equal halves with an impermeable curtain that was fastened and sealed to the bedrock of the lake. Beginning in 1971 the researchers treated one side of the lake with sucrose and the other side with both sucrose and phosphate. From 1971 to 1983 the researchers monitored the phytoplankton biomass in both parts of the lake. The results are shown in Figure 1.",
    "question": "Which of the following was most likely a direct consequence of the addition of phosphate to the lake?",
