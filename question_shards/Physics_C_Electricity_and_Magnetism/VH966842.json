    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nJohn Donne’s poem “The Good-Morrow” was first published in 1633.\n\nThe Good-Morrow\n\n1 I wonder, by my troth,1a pledge of faithfulness what thou and I\n\nDid, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then,\n\nBut sucked on country pleasures, childishly?\n\nOr snorted we in the seven sleepers’ den?2In ancient tradition, the Seven Sleepers refers to a group of young men who hid in a cave to avoid religious persecution; they fell asleep and remained in the cave for hundreds of years.\n\n5’Twas so; But this, all pleasures fancies be.\n\nIf ever any beauty I did see,\n\nWhich I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.\n\nAnd now good morrow to our waking souls,\n\nWhich watch not one another out of fear;\n\n10 For love all love of other sights controls,\n\nAnd makes one little room an everywhere.\n\nLet sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,\n\nLet maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,\n\nLet us possess one world; each hath one, and is one.\n\n15 My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,\n\nAnd true plain hearts do in the faces rest;\n\nWhere can we find two better hemispheres,\n\nWithout sharp North, without declining West?\n\nWhatever dies was not mixed equally;\n\n20 If our two loves be one, or thou and I\n\nLove so alike that none do slacken, none can die.",
