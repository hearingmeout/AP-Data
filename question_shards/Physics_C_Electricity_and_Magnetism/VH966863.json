    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nIn Billy Collins’ poem “The Death of Allegory,” first published in 1990, the speaker refers to allegory: a type of narrative, common in painting and writing, in which abstract ideas are represented as people.\n\nThe Death of Allegory\n\n1 I am wondering what became of all those tall abstractions\n\nthat used to pose, robed and statuesque, in paintings\n\nand parade about on the pages of the Renaissance\n\ndisplaying their capital letters like license plates.\n\n5 Truth cantering on a powerful horse,\n\nChastity, eyes downcast, fluttering with veils.\n\nEach one was marble come to life, a thought in a coat,\n\nCourtesy bowing with one hand always extended,\n\nVillainy sharpening an instrument behind a wall,\n\n10 Reason with her crown and Constancy alert behind a helm.1a helmet; a piece of armor that protects the head\n\nThey are all retired now, consigned to a Florida for tropes.2commonly recurring figurative representations of ideas\n\nJustice is there standing by an open refrigerator.\n\nValor lies in bed listening to the rain.\n\nEven Death has nothing to do but mend his cloak and hood,\n\n15 and all their props are locked away in a warehouse,\n\nhourglasses, globes, blindfolds and shackles.\n\nEven if you called them back, there are no places left\n\nfor them to go, no Garden of Mirth or Bower of Bliss.\n\nThe Valley of Forgiveness is lined with condominiums\n\n20 and chain saws are howling in the Forest of Despair.\n\nHere on the table near the window is a vase of peonies\n\nand next to it black binoculars and a money clip,\n\nexactly the kind of thing we now prefer,\n\nobjects that sit quietly on a line in lower case,\n\n25 themselves and nothing more, a wheelbarrow,\n\nan empty mailbox, a razor blade resting in a glass ashtray.\n\nAs for the others, the great ideas on horseback\n\nand the long-haired virtues in embroidered gowns,\n\nit looks as though they have traveled down\n\n30 that road you see on the final page of storybooks,\n\nthe one that winds up a green hillside and disappears\n\ninto an unseen valley where everyone must be fast asleep.\n“The Death of Allegory” 32 lines from Questions About Angels by Billy Collins, © 1995.
