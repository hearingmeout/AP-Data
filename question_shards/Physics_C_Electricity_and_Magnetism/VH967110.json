    "question": "A negatively charged rod is brought close to, but does not touch, an isolated, neutral conducting sphere. The sphere is then grounded. The ground is then removed, and the rod pulled away from the sphere. Which of the following correctly states the new charge on the sphere and provides an accurate statement of reasoning to support this claim?",
