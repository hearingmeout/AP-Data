    "question": "An air-filled parallel plate capacitor of capacitance <math alttext=\"C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is charged with a battery of emf <math alttext=\"V\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>V</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. The battery is removed, and the distance between the plates is doubled. Which of the following best describes how the energy stored in the capacitor has changed and provides reasoning to justify this claim?",
