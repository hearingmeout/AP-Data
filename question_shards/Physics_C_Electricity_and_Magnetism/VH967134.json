    "question": "An experiment is performed using a parallel plate capacitor and a voltmeter. The purpose of the experiment is to determine a value for the permittivity constant <math alttext=\"epsilon sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>. The capacitor is fully charged and then placed in the circuit shown, where the voltmeter can be used to measure the potential difference across the plates. Measurements for the potential difference are made as the distance <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> between the plates is increased, and the data are shown in the graph. According to the equation <math alttext=\"C equals epsilon sub 0, times the fraction A over d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mfrac><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math>, the graph should be linear. This is true for small values of <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, but for larger values the graph diverges from the straight line. Which of the following is a plausible source of error that may have caused the nonlinear result?",
