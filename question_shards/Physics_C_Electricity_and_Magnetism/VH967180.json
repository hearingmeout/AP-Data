    "question": "The conducting sphere in Figure 1 has a charge of <math alttext=\"negative Q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and is electrically isolated so that there is no conducting path to or from the conducting object shown in Figure 2. The charges on the sphere are in equilibrium. The same charge <math alttext=\"negative Q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is on the isolated conducting object. Which of the following correctly describes a change between the sphere in Figure 1 and the object in Figure 2?",
