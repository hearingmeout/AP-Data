    "question": "Antibiotics can be used to kill the specific pathogenic bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that causes tuberculosis. The appearance of antibiotic-resistant strains has made it more difficult to cure M. tuberculosis infections. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive and pass on the genes to their offspring, making the resistant phenotype more common in the population.\n\n<math alttext=\"D N A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>DNA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> analysis indicates that the genes for antibiotic resistance are not normally present in bacterial chromosomal <math alttext=\"D N A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>DNA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains how the genes for antibiotic resistance can be transmitted between bacteria without the exchange of bacterial chromosomal <math alttext=\"D N A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>DNA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>?",
