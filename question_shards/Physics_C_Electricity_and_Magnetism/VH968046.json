    "description": "A state highway commission is considering removing the lane that allows people to pay cash for a toll on a toll road and requiring all people who use the toll road to pay with an electronic transponder that is connected to their car. The commission wants to know whether the proportion of people who live in the northern part of the state and are in favor of removing the cash lane is different from the proportion of people who live in the southern part of the state and are in favor of removing the cash lane. Independent random samples are selected from the northern and southern parts of the state. The table summarizes the responses of those surveyed.",
