    "question": "A hypothesis test was conducted to see whether there is an association between a person’s income level and his or her education level. A random sample of 225 people was selected, and the appropriate hypothesis test was conducted. The chi-square test statistic and corresponding <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value were approximately 13.36 and 0.01, respectively. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value in the context of the test?",
