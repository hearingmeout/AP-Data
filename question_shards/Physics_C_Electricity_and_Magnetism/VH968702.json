    "description": "To assess the effectiveness of a kindergarten-readiness program, 15 children from a random sample were each given a diagnostic assessment before beginning the program and a follow-up assessment after completing the program. For each child, the difference in the score points between the two assessments was calculated and used to create the 95 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"20.1 comma 23.9\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>20.1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>23.9</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
