    "question": "The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, is native to North America and originally fed on fruit of the wild hawthorn. Since the mid-1800s, a population of flies has emerged that instead feed on domesticated apples. Apple maggot flies typically mate on or near the fruit of their host plants. Many varieties of apples ripen three to four weeks before the hawthorn fruits do.\nThe different fruit preferences of the two fly populations will most likely have which of the following effects?",
