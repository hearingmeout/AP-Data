    "description": "Porcupines can cause damage to wood structures by chewing them. Researchers studied a liquid repellent designed to reduce such damage. A sample of 20 wooden blocks of the same size were treated with the repellent and left outside in an area where porcupines are known to live. After a certain amount of time, the blocks were inspected for the number of porcupine teeth marks visible. The data were used to create the 95 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"4.9 comma 5.8\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>4.9</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>⁢</mo><mn>5.8</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
