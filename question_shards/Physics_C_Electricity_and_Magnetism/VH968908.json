    "description": "Animal scientists studied foraging behavior of the scrub lizard, found in central Florida. Foraging is the process of searching for food. To study such behavior, the scientists recorded the number of head movements per minute for a sample of 63 lizards. A 95 percent confidence interval constructed from the sample is given as <math alttext=\"2.7 plus or minus 0.62\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2.7</mn><mo>±</mo><mn>0.62</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> head movements per minute.",
    "question": "Based on the interval, is a claim of 3 head movements per minute plausible?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The claim is not plausible because 3 head movements per minute is contained within the interval.",
