    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\nThis poem was published in 1713.\n\nThe Atheist and the Acorn\n Methinks this World is oddly made,\n And ev’ry thing’s amiss,\n A dull presuming Atheist said,\n As stretch’d he lay beneath a Shade;\n5And instanced in this:\n\nBehold, quoth he, that mighty thing,\n A Pumpkin, large and round,\n Is held but by a little String,\n Which upwards cannot make it spring,\n10Or bear it from the Ground.\n\nWhilst on this Oak, a Fruit so small,\n So disproportion’d, grows;\n That, who with Sence surveys this All,\n This universal Casual Ball,\n15Its ill Contrivance knows.\n\nMy better Judgment wou’d have hung\n That Weight upon a Tree,\n And left this Mast, thus slightly strung,\n ’Mongst things which on the Surface sprung,\n20And small and feeble be.\n\nNo more the Caviller cou’d say,\n Nor farther Faults descry;\n For, as he upwards gazing lay,\n An Acorn, loosen’d from the Stay,\n25Fell down upon his Eye.\n\nTh’ offended Part with Tears ran o’er,\n As punish’d for the Sin:\n Fool! had that Bough a Pumpkin bore,\n Thy Whimseys must have work’d no more,\n30Nor Scull had kept them in.",
