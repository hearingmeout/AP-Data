    "question": "Researchers studying the sticky droplets found on spider webs will measure the widths of a random sample of droplets. From the sample, the researchers will construct a 95 percent confidence interval to estimate the mean width of all such droplets. Which of the following statements about a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean width is correct?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The interval will be narrower if the researchers increase the level of confidence to 99 percent.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The interval will be narrower if the researchers increase the sample size of droplets.",

      {
        "label": "The interval will be wider if the researchers decrease the level of confidence to 90 percent.",

      {
        "label": "The width of the interval will not be affected if the researchers increase or decrease the number of droplets in the sample.",
