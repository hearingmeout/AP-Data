    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe following poem was first published in 1914.\n\nA Lady\n\n1 You are beautiful and faded\n\nLike an old opera tune\n\nPlayed upon a harpsichord;\n\nOr like the sun-flooded silks\n\n5 Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.*a womans private bedroom or dressing room\n\nIn your eyes\n\nSmoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes,\n\nAnd the perfume of your soul\n\nIs vague and suffusing,\n\n10 With the pungence of sealed spice-jars.\n\nYour half-tones delight me,\n\nAnd I grow mad with gazing\n\nAt your blent colours.\n\nMy vigour is a new-minted penny,\n\n15 Which I cast at your feet.\n\nGather it up from the dust,\n\nThat its sparkle may amuse you.",
