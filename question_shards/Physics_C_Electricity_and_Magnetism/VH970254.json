    "question": "The distribution of four populations of giant kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ingens, living on the same island when it was first surveyed in 1789 are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Four populations of D. ingens in 1789\n\nIn 1852, there was a large earthquake which altered the island’s geography, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Map of the island following the 1852 earthquake\n\nThe island was surveyed again in 2015, and scientists determined that the giant kangaroo rats originally in population A are now to be considered as a new species.\n\nWhich of the following best explains the mechanism that caused this speciation event in the giant kangaroo rats of population A?",
