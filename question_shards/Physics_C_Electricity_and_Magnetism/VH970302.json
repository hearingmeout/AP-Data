    "question": "Antigens are foreign proteins that invade the systems of organisms. Vaccines function by stimulating an organism’s immune system to develop antibodies against a particular antigen. Developing a vaccine involves producing an antigen that can be introduced into the organism being vaccinated and which will trigger an immune response without causing the disease associated with the antigen. Certain strains of bacteria can be used to produce antigens used in vaccines.\nWhich of the following best explains how bacteria can be genetically engineered to produce a desired antigen?",
