    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe following poem by Christina Rossetti was first published in 1881. It employs the form of the Italian or Petrarchan sonnet, a fourteen-line poem divided into an octave (eight lines) and a sestet (six lines). Typically, this type of sonnet develops two sides of a question: one in the octave and the other in the sestet.\n\nI loved you first: but afterwards your love\n\n2Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song\n\nAs drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.\n\nWhich owes the other most? my love was long,\n\nAnd yours one moment seemed to wax1grow more strong;\n\nI loved and guessed at you, you construed2interpreted me\n\n7And loved me for what might or might not be –\n\nNay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.\n\nFor verily3truly love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’\n\nWith separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done,\n\nFor one is both and both are one in love:\n\n12Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’\n\nBoth have the strength and both the length thereof,\n\nBoth of us, of the love which makes us one.",
