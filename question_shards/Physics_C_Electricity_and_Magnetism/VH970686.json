    "question": "Arsenic is a toxic element found in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Scientists have found genes that allow bacteria to remove arsenic from their cytoplasm. Arsenic enters cells as arsenate that must be converted to arsenite to leave cells. Figure 1 provides a summary of the arsenic resistance genes found in the operons of three different bacteria. E. coli <math alttext=\"R 7 73\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>R773</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is found in environments with low arsenic levels. Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans and Ochrobactrum tritici are both found in arsenic‑rich environments.\n\nFigure 1. Operons found in three selected bacteria for arsenic removal\n\nResearchers claim that bacteria that live in environments heavily contaminated with arsenic are more efficient at processing arsenic into arsenite and removing this toxin from their cells. Justify this claim based on the evidence shown in Figure 1.",
