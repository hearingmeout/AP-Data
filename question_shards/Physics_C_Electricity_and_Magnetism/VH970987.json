    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning’s poem “A Musical Instrument” was first published in 1862.\n\nA Musical Instrument\n\n1 What was he doing, the great god Pan,\n\nDown in the reeds by the river?\n\nSpreading ruin and scattering ban,1curses\n\nSplashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,\n\n5And breaking the golden lilies afloat\n\nWith the dragonfly on the river.\n\nHe tore out a reed, the great god Pan,\n\nFrom the deep cool bed of the river;\n\nThe limpid water turbidly ran,\n\n10And the broken lilies a-dying lay,\n\nAnd the dragonfly had fled away,\n\nEre he brought it out of the river.\n\nHigh on the shore sat the great god Pan\n\nWhile turbidly flowed the river;\n\n15And hacked and hewed as a great god can,\n\nWith his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,\n\nTill there was not a sign of the leaf indeed\n\nTo prove it fresh from the river.\n\nHe cut it short, did the great god Pan,\n\n20(How tall it stood in the river!),\n\nThen drew the pith,2spongy tissue in the stems of some plants like the heart of a man,\n\nSteadily from the outside ring,\n\nAnd notched the poor dry empty thing\n\nIn holes, as he sat by the river.\n\n25“This is the way,” laughed the great god Pan\n\n(Laughed while he sat by the river),\n\n“The only way, since gods began\n\nTo make sweet music, they could succeed.”\n\nThen, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,\n\n30He blew in power by the river.\n\nSweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!\n\nPiercing sweet by the river!\n\nBlinding sweet, O great god Pan!\n\nThe sun on the hill forgot to die,\n\n35And the lilies revived, and the dragonfly\n\nCame back to dream on the river.\n\nYet half a beast is the great god Pan,\n\nTo laugh as he sits by the river,\n\nMaking a poet out of a man;\n\n40The true gods sigh for the cost and pain—\n\nFor the reed which grows nevermore again\n\nAs a reed with the reeds in the river.",
