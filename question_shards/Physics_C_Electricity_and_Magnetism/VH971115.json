    "question": "In a certain region, many of the residents are employed by the oil industry. Economists in the region investigated the difference between the salaries of those who work in oil-field jobs and those who work in non-oil-field jobs. Salaries were recorded for a random sample of 84 workers from the 1,200 oil-field workers and a random sample of 72 workers from the 50,000 non-oil-field workers in the region.
