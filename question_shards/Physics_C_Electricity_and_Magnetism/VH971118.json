    "question": "Nondisjunction during meiosis can negatively affect gamete formation. A model showing a possible nondisjunction event and its impact on gamete formation is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Model of a nondisjunction event\n\nWhich of the following best describes the most likely impact on an individual produced from fertilization between one of the daughter cells shown and a normal gamete?",
