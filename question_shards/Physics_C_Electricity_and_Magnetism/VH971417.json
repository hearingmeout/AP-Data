    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThomas Godfrey’s poem “Verses Occasioned by a Young Lady’s asking the Author, What was a Cure for Love?” was first published in 1758.\n\nVerses Occasioned by a Young Lady’s asking the Author, What was a Cure for Love?\n\nFrom me, my Dear, O seek not to receive\n\nWhat e’en deep-read Experience cannot give.\n\nWe may, indeed, from the Physician’s skill\n\nSome Med’cine find to cure the body’s ill.\n\n5But who e’er found the physic for the soul,\n\nOr made th’ affections bend to his controul?\n\nWhen thro’ the blaze of passion objects show\n\nHow dark ’s the shade! how bright the colours glow!\n\nAll the rous’d soul with transport’s overcome,\n\n10And the mind’s surly Monitor is dumb.\n\nIn vain the sages turn their volumes o’er,\n\nAnd on the musty page incessant pore,\n\nStill mighty LOVE triumphant rules the heart,\n\nBaffles their labour, and eludes their art.\n\n15Say what is science, what is reason’s force\n\nTo stop the passions wild ungovern’d course?\n\nReason, ’tis true, may point the rocky shore,\n\nAnd shew the danger, but can serve no more,\n\nFrom wave to wave the wretched wreck is tost,\n\n20And reason ’s in th’ impetuous torrent lost.\n\nIn vain we strive, when urg’d by cold neglect,\n\nBy various means our freedom to effect,\n\nTho’ like the bee from sweet to sweet we rove,\n\nAnd search for ease in the vast round of Love,\n\n25Tho’ in each Nymph we meet a kind return,\n\nStill in the firstfond hopeless flame we burn,\n\nThat dear idea still our thoughts employs,\n\nAnd blest variety itself e’en cloys.\n\nSo exiles banish’d from their native home\n\n30Are met with pity wheresoe’er they come,\n\nYet still their native soil employs their care,\n\nAnd death were ease to lay their ashes there.",
