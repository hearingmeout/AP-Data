    "description": "In a certain city, the population mean commute time to work was reported as 30 minutes. The director of human resources for a certain company in the city claimed the mean commute time for the company’s employees was greater than 30 minutes. The director surveyed 35 randomly selected employees and found that their mean commute time was 31.4 minutes.
