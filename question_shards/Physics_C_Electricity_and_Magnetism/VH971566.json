    "question": "In addition to the <math alttext=\"A B O\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ABO</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> blood groups, humans have an <math alttext=\"M N\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MN</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> blood type system in which the <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"N\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> alleles are codominant to one another. These alleles code for glycoproteins that act as antigens on the red blood cells. Scientists determined the frequencies of the <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"N\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> alleles in three localized and stable human populations in the Philippines. In Isabela, M and N alleles had a frequency of .8 and .21, respectively. Butuan had M and N allele frequencies of .82 and .18, respectively. Metro Manila had M and N allele frequencies of .55 and .51, respectively.\n\nWhich of the following would most affect the allelic frequencies of the populations on Isabela and Butuan?",
