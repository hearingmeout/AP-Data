    "description": "A bank manager wants the average time that a customer waits in line to be at most 3 minutes. Customers at the bank have complained about the long wait times. To test whether the average wait time at the bank is greater than 3 minutes, 60 customers were randomly selected as they entered the bank and their wait times were recorded. The mean wait time was 4.7 minutes. A one-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test resulted in a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.00031.",
