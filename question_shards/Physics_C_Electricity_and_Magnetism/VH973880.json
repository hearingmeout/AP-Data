    "question": "Henslow's sparrow is a songbird found in North American grasslands. The logging industry created vast meadow habitats for the sparrow in the late 1800s. Henslow's sparrow populations came to a peak in the mid‑1900s. A recent survey of ten Midwest counties are shown in Figure 1.\n\nTable 1. Year of Last Documented Observations of Henslow's Sparrow in Ten Selected Midwest Counties\n\nCounty \nNumber of Confirmed Observations \nLast Documented Observation \n\n1 \n8 \n2007 \n\n2 \n1 \n2007 \n\n3 \n2 \n2007 \n\n4 \n2 \n2015 \n\n5 \n6 \n2015 \n\n6 \n3 \n2006 \n\n8 \n1 \n2004 \n\n9 \n4 \n2007 \n\n10 \n4 \n2007 \n\nHuman activities can drive changes in ecosystems that affect the risk of extinction. An experiment is designed to help prevent the further decline and extinction of the Henslow's sparrow in which controlled burns will be set in the each of the ten Midwest counties in order to prevent the regrowth of the forest.\n\nWhich of the following represents an alternate hypothesis tested by this experiment with regard to the population sizes of Henslow's sparrows?",
