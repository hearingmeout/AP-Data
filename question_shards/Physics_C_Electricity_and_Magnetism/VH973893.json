    "question": "A 100 acre woodlot was observed for the last forty years. Five plant species (1 through 5) were surveyed, with the results shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Data from Forty-Year Survey of Five Plant Species in a Woodlot\n\nYear of Survey \nSpecies 1 Population \nSpecies 2Population \nSpecies 3Population \nSpecies 4 Population \nSpecies 5 Population \n\n1 \n35 \n30 \n23 \n32 \n25 \n\n20 \n35 \n42 \n20 \n2 \n1 \n\n40 \n50 \n50 \n2 \n0 \n0 \n\nSome researchers claim that the decrease in plant species richness of this woodlot is unrelated to human activities over the last forty years.\n\nWhich of the following would be an appropriate alternative hypothesis?",
