    "question": "Mollusk fossils were excavated and collected from a coastal cliff. Scientists studying the fossils observed patterns of changing shell shape in the mollusks. The scientists identified a period of stability or stasis, followed by rapid change, and then stasis again with regard to shell shape.\nWhich of the following statements best predicts the result of a comparison between the fossils found before and after the period of rapid change?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The same species will be found in both static periods, but they will have different shell shapes.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The same species will be found in both static periods, but the species in the second static period will have smaller shells due to the stress of undergoing rapid change.",
