Tree Type Spruce Pine Fir Deciduous Other Observed Count 51 21 10 9 9 The logging company would like to use its sample to provide convincing statistical evidence that over 50 percent of the trees in the forest are spruce trees. The logging company has decided to use a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to justify its claim. Why is the chi-square goodness-of-fit test not an appropriate procedure for the logging company to use?",
