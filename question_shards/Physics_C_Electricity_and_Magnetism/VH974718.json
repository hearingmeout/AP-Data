    "question": "A proton travels through a region with a uniform magnetic field and uniform electric field by passing through a parallel plate capacitor, as shown in the figure. The proton enters the region traveling east, moves through the fields undeflected, and continues to travel east after exiting the region. What is the direction of the magnetic field?",
