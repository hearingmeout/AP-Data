    "question": "Students created a model showing one possible mechanism for speciation in which a geographic barrier separated one large population into two smaller populations, A and B. Over time, populations A and B developed into two distinct species. The model is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Model of speciation\n\nWhich of the following best describes what occurred during the periods indicated by the arrows?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Natural selection acted on variation that was present in both populations A and B, and the lack of gene flow eventually led to the formation of two new species.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Population B was separated for a longer time from the original population than population A was, and population B evolved into a more distinct new species than population A did.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Gene flow between populations A and B maintained sufficient variation in both gene pools to facilitate the development of two distinct species.",

      {
        "label": "In response to different environments, populations A and B experienced different mutation rates, leading to the emergence of two different gene pools and, over time, new species A and B.",
