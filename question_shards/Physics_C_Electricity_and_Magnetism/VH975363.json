    "question": "Tobacco hawk moths, Manduca sexta, feed exclusively on sugar-rich nectar produced in the flowers of tobacco plants. To feed, the moth inserts its proboscis (a long, tubular mouthpart) into the flower to reach the nectary, which is usually at the end of a long tube in the flower. Moths will feed on the nectar of the tobacco plant species whose nectaries they can access. A study determined the proboscis sizes in one tobacco hawk moth population. The data are shown in Figure 1. The most abundant tobacco species in the population’s habitat has a nectary tube that is <math alttext=\"5 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mtext>cm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> long.\n\nFigure 1. Proboscis length distribution in a population of tobacco hawk moths\n\nOver the next year, a virus attacks and rapidly kills almost all plants of the tobacco species. A closely related species of tobacco that is resistant to the virus becomes established during that same year. The nectary tube in the resistant species averages <math alttext=\"7.5 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>7.5</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mtext>cm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. Scientists monitored the area for the next five years to determine how this change affected the moth population.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the expected distribution of proboscis size of the moths at the end of the five‑year study?",
