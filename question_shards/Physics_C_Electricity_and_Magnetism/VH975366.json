Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic relationships of selected vertebrates.\n\nFigure 1. Cladogram of selected vertebrate groups\n\nBased on the phylogenetic relationships shown in Figure 1, which of the following best explains the similarities exhibited by whales, bony fishes, and cartilaginous fishes?",
