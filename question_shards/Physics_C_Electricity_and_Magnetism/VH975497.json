    "description": "A manufacturing company with 350 employees is changing the employee health insurance plan to either plan A or plan B. The company wants to know if employees have a preference between the two plans and whether or not preference differs between those employees who have family members covered under the current plan (group 1) and those who do not (group 2). The human resources office takes a simple random sample from each of the two groups, sends information about both plans to the employees in each sample, and asks them whether they prefer plan A or plan B. The table summarizes the responses received, with expected cell counts in parentheses.",
