    "question": "A scientist maintains a large population of the fruit fly Drosophila affinis in the laboratory. After 20 generations of allowing this population of about 1000 flies to mate randomly, 10 females and 10 males were isolated from the rest of the population. Both the larger population and the isolated population were maintained under identical conditions and allowed to mate randomly for another 20 generations. After the 20 generations, DNA sequencing was used to determine the genetic composition of each population.\nWhich of the following predicts the expected outcome of the experiment?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The two populations will show significant genetic differences because the founder effect will result in significant losses in diversity in the smaller population.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The two populations will show significant genetic differences because there will be much higher rates of mutation in the smaller population.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The two populations will not show any differences because they were reared under identical conditions.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The two populations will not show any differences because they originated from the same gene pool.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The two populations will show significant genetic differences because the founder effect will result in significant losses in diversity in the smaller population."
