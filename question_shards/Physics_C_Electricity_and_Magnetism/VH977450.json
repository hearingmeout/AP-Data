    "description": "Ecologists conducted a study to investigate the potential ecological impact of golf courses. Investigators monitored the reproductive success of bluebirds in birdhouses at nine golf courses and ten similar birdhouses at nongolf sites. Data on nests in birdhouses occupied only by bluebirds are shown in the table.",
    "question": "Observed Number of Nests per Birdhouse by Location0 nests 1 nest 2 or 3 nests Total Golf 30 42 8 80 Nongolf 40 58 22 120 Total 70 100 30 200 If the proportions of nests occupied is the same for golf and nongolf sites, what would be the expected count of birdhouses with 1 nest in nongolf locations?",
