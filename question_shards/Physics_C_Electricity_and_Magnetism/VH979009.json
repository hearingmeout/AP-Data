    "question": "A U-shaped magnet is placed on a digital scale that provides the force exerted on the scale in newtons. A horizontal wire passes between the two poles of the magnet. A student records the reading of the scale before current flows through the wire. At a later time, current flows through the wire and into the plane of the page, as shown in the figure. Which of the following predictions about how the reading on the scale will change after current is allowed to flow through the wire is correct?",
