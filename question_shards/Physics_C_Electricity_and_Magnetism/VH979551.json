    "question": "Students want to find the direction of a uniform magnetic field in their experimental setup. They direct electrons from the left side of the page into the setup and observe that the path of the electrons curves toward the top of the page, as shown above. Which is the correct prediction for the direction of the magnetic field in this region?",
