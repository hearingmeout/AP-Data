    "question": "In an experiment, a student lays a copper wire parallel to and on top of a dipole magnet, as shown in the figure. The student then allows a current to travel through the wire in the direction indicated in the figure. Which of the following claims is correct regarding the effect that the magnet has on the wire once the current flows through the circuit and provides appropriate reasoning?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The wire will be attracted toward the magnet, because the magnetic force exerted on the wire is toward the magnet.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The wire will be repelled from the magnet because the magnetic force exerted on the wire is away from the magnet.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The wire will rotate clockwise, because the force that the magnet exerts on opposite ends of the wire are in opposite directions.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The wire will rotate counterclockwise, because the force that the magnet exerts on opposite ends of the wire are in opposite directions.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "There will be no effect on the wire, because the magnetic field is parallel to the direction of the current that travels through the wire.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The wire will rotate counterclockwise, because the force that the magnet exerts on opposite ends of the wire are in opposite directions."
