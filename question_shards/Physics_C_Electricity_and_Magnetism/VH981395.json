    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem was first published in 1633.\n\nElegy V: His Picture\n\n1 Here take my picture, though I bid farewell;\n\nThine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.\n\n’Tis like me now, but I dead, ’twill be more\n\nWhen we are shadows both, than ’twas before.\n\n5 When weather-beaten I come back; my hand,\n\nPerhaps with rude oars torn, or sun-beams tanned,\n\nMy face and breast of haircloth, and my head\n\nWith care’s rash sudden hoariness1covered with grey or white hair (due to advanced age) o’erspread,\n\nMy body a sack of bones, broken within,\n\n10 And powder’s2gunpowder blue stains scattered on my skin;\n\nIf rival fools tax thee to have loved a man,\n\nSo foul, and coarse, as oh, I may seem then,\n\nThis shall say what I was: and thou shalt say,\n\nDo his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?\n\n15 Or do they reach his judging mind, that he\n\nShould now love less, what he did love to see?\n\nThat which in him was fair and delicate,\n\nWas but the milk, which in love’s childish state\n\nDid nurse it: who now is grown strong enough\n\n20 To feed on that, which to disused tastes seems tough.",
