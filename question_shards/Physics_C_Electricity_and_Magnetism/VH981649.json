    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem is from a collection first published in 1964. In the poem, the speaker visits a medieval tomb in an English cathedral.\n\nAn Arundel Tomb\n\nSide by side, their faces blurred,\n\nThe earl and countess lie in stone,\n\nTheir proper habits vaguely shown\n\nAs jointed armour, stiffened pleat,\n\n5And that faint hint of the absurd—\n\nThe little dogs under their feet.\n\nSuch plainness of the pre-baroque\n\nHardly involves the eye, until\n\nIt meets his left-hand gauntlet,1a glove made of armor still\n\n10Clasped empty in the other; and\n\nOne sees, with a sharp tender shock,\n\nHis hand withdrawn, holding her hand.\n\nThey would not think to lie so long.\n\nSuch faithfulness in effigy\n\n15Was just a detail friends would see:\n\nA sculptor’s sweet commissioned grace\n\nThrown off in helping to prolong\n\nThe Latin names around the base.\n\nThey would not guess how early in\n\n20Their supine stationary voyage\n\nThe air would change to soundless damage,\n\nTurn the old tenantry away;\n\nHow soon succeeding eyes begin\n\nTo look, not read. Rigidly they\n\n25Persisted, linked, through lengths and breadths\n\nOf time. Snow fell, undated. Light\n\nEach summer thronged the glass. A bright\n\nLitter of birdcalls strewed the same\n\nBone-riddled ground. And up the paths\n\n30The endless altered people came,\n\nWashing at their identity.\n\nNow, helpless in the hollow of\n\nAn unarmorial age, a trough\n\nOf smoke in slow suspended skeins2coils\n\n35Above their scrap of history,\n\nOnly an attitude remains:\n\nTime has transfigured them into\n\nUntruth. The stone fidelity\n\nThey hardly meant has come to be\n\n40Their final blazon,3coat of arms and to prove\n\nOur almost-instinct almost true:\n\nWhat will survive of us is love.\n\"An Arundel Tomb\" from THE COMPLETE POEMS OF PHILIP LARKIN by Philip Larkin, edited by Archie Burnett.
