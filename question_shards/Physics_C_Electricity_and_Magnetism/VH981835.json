    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem was first published in 2008.\n\nThe Magic Kingdom\n\n“And as in the daily casualties of life every man is, as it were, threatened with numberless deaths, so long as it remains uncertain which of them is his fate, I would ask whether it is not better to suffer one and die, than to live in fear of all?” – St. Augustine, City of God\n\n1   This morning, I found on a slip of paper tucked into a book\n\na list of questions I’d written down years ago to ask the doctor.\n\nWhat if it has spread? Is it possible I’m crazy? I’ve just returned\n\nfrom Florida, from visiting my mother’s last sister, who is eighty\n\n5   & doing fine. At the airport, my flight grounded by a storm,\n\nI bought a magazine, which fell open to a photograph\n\nof three roseate spoonbills tossing down their elegant shadows\n\non a chartreuse field of fertilizer-production waste.\n\nTwo little girls emptied their Ziplocs of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish\n\n10 onto the carpet & picked them up, one by one, with great delicacy,\n\nbefore popping them into their mouths. Their mother, outside\n\nsmoking, kept an eye on them through the glass. After my cousin died,\n\nmy father died & then my brother. Next, my father’s older brother\n\n& his wife. And, finally, after my mother died, I expected\n\n15 to die myself. And because this happened very quickly\n\n& because these were, really, almost all the people I knew,\n\nI spent each day smashing dishes with one of my uncle’s hammers\n\n& gluing them back together in new ways. It was strange work\n\n& dangerous, even though I tried to protect myself—\n\n20 wearing a quilted bathrobe & goggles & leather work gloves\n\n& opening all the windows, even in snow, against the vapors\n\nof the industrial adhesives. Most days now I get up late\n\n& brew coffee & the smell rises from the old enamel pot\n\nI’ve had to balance under the dark drip ever since the carafe\n\n25 that came with the machine shattered in the dishwasher last month.\n\nOne morning I found a lump in my breast & my vision narrowed\n\nto a small dot & I began to sweat. My legs & arms felt weak,\n\n& my heart thrashed behind its bars. We were not written\n\nto be safe. In the old tales, the woodcutter’s daughter’s path\n\n30 takes her, each time, through the dark forest. There are new words\n\nfor all of this: a shot of panic becomes the rustle of glucocorticoid\n\nsignaling the sympathetic nervous system into a response\n\nregulated by the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\n\nAnd, as I go along, these freshly minted charms clatter together\n\n35 in the tender doeskin of the throat as though the larynx\n\nwere nothing if not a sack of amulets tied with a cord & worn\n\naround the neck. But I tell you I sat on the bathroom floors for hours,\n\ntrembling. And I can tell you this because the lump was just a lump\n\n& some days now I don’t even dread the end although I know\n\n40 it will arrive. The garage is filled with buckets of broken china.\n\nThe girls chased each other & waved their arms, casting spells,\n\nthe trim of their matching gingham dresses the electric pink\n\nof the birds’ wings. They turned each other into princesses\n\n& super-girls & then they pretended to change back.\n\n45 Oh, no. You forgot to say forever—they took turns repeating\n\nwith dramatic dismay, melting into puddles of themselves,\n\ntheir sandals & sunburned knees vanishing beneath their hems.\nFrom THE ETERNAL CITY: POEMS by Kathleen Graber.
