    "description": "In the Florida Everglades, Burmese pythons are an invasive species. They were introduced into southern Florida in 1992. These pythons feed on many of the native Florida species, establishing the pythons as the top predator in the environment. By the year 2000, their population had increased dramatically.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 display data collected by ecologists studying the results of the Burmese python invasion. Figure 1 shows counts of animals collected from nighttime road surveys in southern Florida, which are used to estimate population size. Figure 2 shows data collected from mosquitoes captured from the wild. <math alttext=\"D N A\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>DNA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> sequencing was used to identify the species of blood that the mosquitoes had in their stomachs, identifying various hosts used by the mosquitoes.\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of observations of selected mammals in 1996 and 2011\n\nFigure 2. Change in host preference by Culex cedecei between 1979 and 2016. Numbers do not add up to one hundred percent because these represent a subset of all the host species.\n\nIn 1996, the native Culex cedecei mosquitoes in southern Florida preferentially took blood meals from white-tailed deer and raccoons. It was predicted that changes in host population size would alter these host preferences. Additionally, it is known that cotton rats are often infected by the Everglades virus, which normally exists in animals, but is capable of infecting humans. Ecologists predict that increased feeding on cotton rats by C. cedecei may significantly increase the tendency of this virus to infect humans.",
