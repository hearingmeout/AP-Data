    "question": "A uniform magnetic field of magnitude <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> directed to the right exists in a certain region of space, as shown. A loop of wire is placed in the field such that a vector normal to the plane of the loop is at a <math alttext=\"30 degree\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn><mi>°</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> angle relative to the field. Which of the following is a correct statement about the direction of the current induced in the loop?",
