    "question": "A rectangular coil of wire is positioned in the plane of the page as shown above. A long straight wire, also in the plane of the page, initially carries a steady current of magnitude <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to the right. During a given time interval, the current in the wire decreases at a constant rate to zero, changes direction, and increases at a constant rate to the left. Which of the following best describes the direction of the current, if any, induced in the rectangular coil while the current in the wire is changing?",
