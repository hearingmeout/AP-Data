    "question": "A long, straight wire carrying a constant current creates a magnetic field around it. The magnetic field strength is measured with a magnetic field sensor at varying distances from the wire while the current is kept constant. Which of the following indicates a graph that will have a constant positive slope and the Maxwell equation most closely related to the graph?",
