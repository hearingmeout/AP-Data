    "question": "A biologist was investigating the effects of herbivory on the amount of nicotine produced by the leaves of tobacco plants (Nicotiana rustica). Six groups of plants were grown from seed in the same greenhouse with identical environmental conditions. Three groups were then each exposed for a different interval of time to tobacco hornworms (Maduca sexta), which feed on the foliage of tobacco plants. The amount of nicotine present in the leaves was measured at the beginning and end of each time interval. As a control, the other three groups were not exposed to hornworms. The results of the experiment are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.
