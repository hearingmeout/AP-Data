    "question": "Researchers studied the diversity of macroscopic invertebrates in different areas of watershed ecosystems. They collected samples from 58 sites along 11 streams in the same geographical area. Their data were classified by stream type and can be found in Figure 1. The stream-type classifications range from the perennial stream type, which always has water, to the intermittent stream type, which is dry for more than nine months during the year.\n\nFigure 1. Diversity of macroscopic invertebrates in different stream types. Error bars represent a 95% confidence interval (<math alttext=\"plus or minus\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>±</mo></mrow></mstyle></math> two Standard Errors from the mean).\n\nWhich of the stream types had a statistically lower macroscopic invertebrate species diversity than the seasonal streams?",
