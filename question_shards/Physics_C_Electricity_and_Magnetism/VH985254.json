    "question": "Students observed the distribution of different color phenotypes in northern ravine salamanders (Plethodon electromorphus) before and after a spring flood. The data are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Observed number of salamanders by phenotype before and after a spring flood\n\nSalamander Distribution before the Flood (<math alttext=\"in numbers\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>n</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) \nSalamander Distribution after the Flood (<math alttext=\"in numbers\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>n</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) \n\nBlack phenotype \n13 \n7 \n\nDark-brown phenotype \n25 \n14 \n\nLight-brown phenotype \n6 \n3 \n\nWhich of the following is an appropriate null hypothesis regarding the phenotypic frequencies of this population of salamanders before and after the flood?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "More black salamanders survived because they could better hide from predators on the dark muddy soil, so the frequency of the black phenotype significantly increased in the population after the flood.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Fewer light-brown salamanders survived because they had a reduced chance of finding mates due to the high water levels, so the frequency of the light-brown phenotype in the population decreased after the flood.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "More dark-brown salamanders migrated to a new, drier area because of the flood and fewer of them remained in the original habitat, so the frequency of dark-brown salamander significantly decreased in the population after the flood.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The proportions of black, dark-brown, and light-brown salamanders before and after the flood are not significantly different, and any observed differences are due to random chance.",
