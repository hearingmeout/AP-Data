    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem about a farrier (a blacksmith who makes shoes for horses) was first published in 1918.\n\nFelix Randal\n\n1 Felix Randal the farrier, O is he dead then? my duty all ended,\n\nWho have watched his mould of man, big-boned and hardy-handsome\n\nPining, pining, till time when reason rambled in it and some\n\nFatal four disorders, fleshed there, all contended?\n\n5 Sickness broke him. Impatient, he cursed at first, but mended\n\nBeing anointed and all; though a heavenlier heart began some\n\nMonths earlier, since I had our sweet reprieve and ransom\n\nTendered to him. Ah well, God rest him all road ever he offended!\n\nThis seeing the sick endears them to us, us too it endears.\n\n10 My tongue had taught thee comfort, touch had quenched thy tears,\n\nThy tears that touched my heart, child, Felix, poor Felix Randal;\n\nHow far from then forethought of, all thy more boisterous years,\n\nWhen thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst peers,\n\nDidst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal!\n\"Felix Randal,\" Gerard Manley Hopkins, The Oxford University Press, 1918.",
