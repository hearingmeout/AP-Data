    "description": "Sea otters living along the Pacific coast were hunted to near extinction in the nineteenth century. After being protected from hunting in the early 1900s, a remnant population of otters near Adak Island, Alaska, recovered rapidly. Otters did not return to the environmentally similar nearby island, Alaid Island. Sea otters eat sea urchins, which eat kelp, a brown alga. Researchers surveyed both islands in 1988, to measure sea urchin biomass and kelp density. The data are presented in Table 1.",

The researchers hypothesized that the population sizes of the larger marine mammals that the killer whales normally prey on declined, so the killer whales were starting to prey on different prey, including the smaller sea otters. Which of the following best predicts the effects of an increase in killer whale predation on sea otters on the Adak Island ecosystem?",
