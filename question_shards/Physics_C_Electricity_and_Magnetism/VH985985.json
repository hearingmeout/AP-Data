    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem is from a collection published in 2008.\n\nPumpkin Farm, Half Moon Bay\n\n1 Now you veer away from me like a sailor on his keel\n\ninto a windless place, into gold corn blades coiling\n\nin the dry light-and-shade of furrows run over everywhere\n\nwith vines, brown curls rasping like metal files\n\n5 against the cotton weave of your sweatshirt.\n\nYou enter the rows shoulder first, sideways.\n\nA note I make of your character: that instinct\n\nto minimize destruction, whistling the scalpel’s\n\nshining lyric all the way into a dark veiny passage,\n\n10 stitching the wound to stop the pain.\n\nMeanwhile a crowd of schoolchildren out of school\n\nmanaged only loosely by their teachers\n\nare bruising the natural world, their voices\n\nhigh-pitched confusions of sea birds. Clumps\n\n15 of little boys and girls climbing blocks of hay,\n\npiles of pumpkins, the big green tractor.\n\nThey are everywhere, a scramble of jostlings\n\nand tumblings, the flinging of arms as they jump,\n\nthe pumping of fists into shoulders. I know\n\n20 the changing expressions of the faces\n\nand what is likely to happen next: boys lift\n\npumpkins the size of basketballs over their heads,\n\ntrying to smash them, wanting to see them explode.\n\nYou turn back to say something I’m too far away to hear.\n\n25 The trouble with me is I worry too much about intrusion,\n\nand imagine too purely someone else’s passions\n\nand get them wrong. Some days everything seems\n\npointless. What moves any of us to do what we do?\n\nI go around the field of corn on a rutted\n\n30 tractor road, pushing a barrow of pumpkins to the car.\n\nAnd you? Whatever you’ve said is over.\n\nYou’re seeing between the rows the same unruly\n\nmess of tissues, organs, shapes\n\nsuch as those you’ve learned to cut into,\n\n35 cutting like Aeneas1In Greco-Roman mythology, and as seen in the epic poem by Virgil, Aeneas was a Trojan hero who sailed the Mediterranean to Rome after the Trojan War. through waves blown red and black\n\nby a cold wind, one city or another at his back\n\nburning, and nothing in the way of his future.\n\nIn the offing there is nothing but blue, water and sky—\n\nthe straight, the narrow, the exact.\n\n40 In your mind you’re rehearsing some procedure—\n\nthe yards, the riggings, the sutures yare in your hands.\n\nThis, like this. Yes, yes. This. You’re seeing\n\nwhat in the body is in the way, occlusions and clamps\n\nand the new sealing knife that burns the bleeders shut.\nUsed by permission.",
