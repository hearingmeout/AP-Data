    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\nThis poem was written by American poet John Frederick Nims (1913–1999).\n\nDedication: Love Poem\n My clumsiest dear, whose hands shipwreck vases,\n At whose quick touch all glasses chip and ring,\n Whose palms are bulls in china, burs in linen,\n And have no cunning with any soft thing\n\n5Except all ill-at-ease fidgeting people:\n The refugee uncertain at the door\n You make at home; deftly you steady\n The drunk clambering on his undulant floor.\n\nUnpredictable dear, the taxi drivers’ terror,\n10Shrinking from far headlights pale as a dime\n Yet leaping before red apoplectic streetcars—\n Misfit in any space. And never on time.\n\nA wrench in clocks and the solar system. Only\n With words and people and love you move at ease;\n15In traffic of wit expertly manoeuvre\n And keep us, all devotion, at your knees,\n\nForgetting your coffee spreading on our flannel,\n Your lipstick grinning on our coat,\n So gayly in love’s unbreakable heaven\n20Our souls on glory of spilt bourbon float.\n\nBe with me, darling, early and late. Smash glasses—\n I will study wry music for your sake.\n For should your hands drop white and empty\n All the toys of the world would break.\n“Dedication: Love Poem” from Selected Poems by John Frederick Nims. © 1982 by The University of Chicago.
