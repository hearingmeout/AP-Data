    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThe speaker in this poem is a tourist visiting the Italian city of Palermo.\n\nPalermo\n\n1 It was foolish of us to leave our room.\n\nThe empty plaza was shimmering.\n\nThe clock looked ready to melt.\n\nThe heat was a mallet striking a ball\n\n5 and sending it bouncing into the nettles1prickly plants of summer.\n\nEven the bees had knocked off for the day.\n\nThe only thing moving besides us\n\n(and we had since stopped under an awning)\n\nwas a squirrel who was darting this way and that\n\n10 as if he were having second thoughts\n\nabout crossing the street,\n\nhis head and tail twitching with indecision.\n\nYou were looking in a shop window\n\nbut I was watching the squirrel\n\n15 who now rose up on his hind legs,\n\nand after pausing to look in all directions,\n\nbegan to sing in a beautiful voice\n\na melancholy aria2song traditionally included in an opera about life and death,\n\nhis forepaws clutched against his chest,\n\n20 his face full of longing and hope,\n\nas the sun beat down\n\non the roofs and awnings of the city,\n\nand the earth continued to turn\n\nand hold in position the moon\n\n25 which would appear later that night\n\nas we sat in a café\n\nand I stood up on the table\n\nwith the encouragement of the owner\n\nand sang for you and the others\n\n30 the song the squirrel had taught me how to sing.\n\"Palermo,\" Billy Collins, Penguin Random House and Macmillan, 2013.",
