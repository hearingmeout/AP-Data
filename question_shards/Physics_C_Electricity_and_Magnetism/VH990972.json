    "description": "In the mid-1920s, gray wolves, Canis lupus, were eliminated from Yellowstone National Park in the northwestern United States. Over the course of 1995 and 1996, 31 wolves from Canada were relocated to the park. Researchers have tracked the growth of the wolf population from 21 in 1995 to 108 at the end of the study in 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Yellowstone National Park annual wolf population from 1995 to 2016\n\nThe wolves prey on large herbivores, primarily elk. The carcasses of wolf kills are a valuable food source for coyotes, Canis latrans. When coyotes are feeding on carcasses, they may be chased off the carcass and/or killed by wolves. Coyotes also hunt small mammals for food.\n\nResearchers were studying the effect of wolves’ presence on the behavior of coyotes. Researchers observed coyotes in a specific area of Yellowstone National Park and recorded the proportion of the coyotes’ time spent on five different activities when wolves were present in the study area and when wolves were absent (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2.

    "question": "Based on the data in the figure, a student claimed that since 2007, the carrying capacity of wolves in Yellowstone National Park has been 100 wolves, and the maximum annual per capita growth rate of gray wolves is 0.6 wolves per wolf per year.\n\nWhich of the following is closest to the calculated wolf population size in 2017 based on the student’s claim?",
