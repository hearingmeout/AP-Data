        "text": "(b) Kudzu is an invasive plant species that has been spreading in the United States at a rapid rate. First introduced in 1876, the plant was widely used to prevent soil erosion. The leaves of the plant have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can supply the plant with nitrogen in nitrogen-poor soils. The plants have high rates of photosynthesis, and the vines can grow over other plant species, including trees and shrubs.\n\nFigure 2.
