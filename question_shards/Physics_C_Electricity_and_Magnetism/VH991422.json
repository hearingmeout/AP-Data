    "description": "Anagha is interested in buying a new Model X car and wants to gather information about how the selling price of the car is related to the year of the model. She randomly selects 24 used Model X cars for sale. For each used car, she records the car’s selling price (in dollars) and age (in years). She computes a 96 percent confidence interval to estimate the slope of the regression line relating the age of a used Model X car to its selling price. The resulting confidence interval is given by <math alttext=\"negative 5,556 comma negative 3,157\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>5</mn><mtext>,</mtext><mn>556</mn><mo>⁢</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3</mn><mtext>,</mtext><mn>157</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
