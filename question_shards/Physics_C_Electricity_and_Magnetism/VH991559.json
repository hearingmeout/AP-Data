    "question": "Figure 1 shows a food web that describes the relationships within a community containing nine species. Each circle represents a separate species. The size of the circle represents the population size of the species relative to other species in the same trophic level.\n\nFigure 1. Trophic relationships among organisms in a community\n\nBased on the information in Figure 1, which of the following best predicts a short-term effect of removing secondary consumer X from the community?",
