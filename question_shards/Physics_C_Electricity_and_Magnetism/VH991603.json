    "description": "Fur color is a genetically controlled trait in mice. A population of a species of mouse that typically lives in habitats with light-colored soil was studied for several generations. The background color of the habitat of this population became darker after the second generation due to human activity. A researcher sampled approximately 120 mice in each generation and recorded the fur color phenotypes as shown in Figure 1.",
    "question": "Figure 1. Fur color phenotype distribution of mice over four generations The researcher claims that there is no selective advantage to fur color, so light and dark fur color phenotypes are present in similar frequencies in the fourth generation of this mouse population. Based on the data in Figure 1, which of the following best evaluates this null hypothesis?",

      {

      {
        "label": "The null hypothesis is rejected, because there is no significant difference between the frequencies of the two phenotypes right after the human-caused change to the habitat in the third generation.",
