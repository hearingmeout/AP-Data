    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\nThis poem was written in 1714, soon after the author, an Anglo-Irish satirist, moved from England to Ireland.\n\nIn Sickness\n ’Tis true—then why should I repine,1complain\n To see my Life so fast decline?\n But, why obscurely here alone?\n Where I am neither lov’d nor known.\n5My State of Health none care to learn;\n My Life is here no Soul’s Concern.\n And, those with whom I now converse,\n Without a Tear will tend my Herse.2hearse\n Remov’d from kind Arbuthnot’s3John Arbuthnot (1667–1735), Scottish physician Aid,\n10Who knows his Art but not the Trade;\n Preferring his Regard for me\n Before his Credit or his Fee.\n Some formal Visits, Looks, and Words,\n What meer Humanity affords,\n15I meet perhaps from three or four,\n From whom I once expected more;\n Which those who tend the Sick for pay\n Can act as decently as they.\n But no obliging, tender Friend\n20To help at my approaching End,\n My Life is now a Burthen grown\n To others, e’er it be my own.\n\nYE formal Weepers for the Sick,\n In your last Offices be quick:\n25And spare my absent Friends the Grief\n To hear, yet give me no Relief;\n Expir’d To-day, entomb’d To-morrow,\n When known, will save a double Sorrow.",
