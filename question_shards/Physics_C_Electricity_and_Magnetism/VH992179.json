    "question": "One of the oldest known mammalian fossils belongs to a small furry species, Hadrocodium wui, that lived 195 million years ago. For the following 100 million years, only a small number of groups of mammalian fossils are found in the fossil record. By 65 million years ago, the nonavian dinosaurs were extinct. By 55 million years ago, there were 130 mammal genera, including 4,000 different species that occupied a wide variety of habitats.\nWhich of the following best describes the cause of the rapid increase in the number of mammalian species between 65 and 55 million years ago?",
