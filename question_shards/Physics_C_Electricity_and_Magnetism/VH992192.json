    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis poem is from a collection of poetry published in 2009.\n\nTwo Trees\n\n1 One morning, Don Miguel got out of bed\n\nwith one idea rooted in his head:\n\nto graft his orange to his lemon tree.\n\nIt took him the whole day to work them free,\n\n5 lay open their sides, and lash them tight.\n\nFor twelve months, from the shame or from the fright\n\nthey put forth nothing; but one day there appeared\n\ntwo lights in the dark leaves. Over the years\n\nthe limbs would get themselves so tangled up\n\n10 each bough looked like it gave a double crop,\n\nand not one kid in the village didn’t know\n\nthe magic tree in Miguel’s patio.\n\nThe man who bought the house had had no dream\n\nso who can say what dark malicious whim\n\n15 led him to take his axe and split the bole*tree trunk\n\nalong its fused seam, then dig two holes.\n\nAnd no, they did not die from solitude;\n\nnor did their branches bear a sterile fruit;\n\nnor did their unhealed flanks weep every spring\n\n20 for those four yards that lost them everything,\n\nas each strained on its shackled root to face\n\nthe other’s empty, intricate embrace.\n\nThey were trees, and trees don’t weep or ache or shout.\n\nAnd trees are all this poem is about.\n“Two Trees” from RAIN by Don Paterson.
