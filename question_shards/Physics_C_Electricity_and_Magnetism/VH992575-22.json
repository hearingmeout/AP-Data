    "question": "Read each question carefully. Write your response in the space provided for each part of each question. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. River dolphins are morphologically distinct from other dolphins and are primarily restricted to freshwater ecosystems in Asia and South America. Determining the phylogeny of these animals based on morphology has been difficult because they have a large number of derived characters including a long, narrow rostrum (beak), a low dorsal fin, a flexible neck, and eyes that are greatly reduced. River dolphins were originally classified together based on morphology, but molecular studies have shown that they are less closely related than previously thought. Scientists analyzed the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes, including the genes for cytochrome b and two ribosomal <math alttext=\"R N A s\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>RNAs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. By combining the nucleotide sequence data with analyses of embryonic development and morphology, the scientists have proposed the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1. Baleen whales that are filter feeders are used as an outgroup. Figure 1.
