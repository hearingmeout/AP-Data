    "question": "Industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators collect enormous amounts of particulate matter (coal ash) at coal-burning power plants. Which of the following best describes an environmental disadvantage of using industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators for pollution abatement?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Coal ash contains toxic levels of several different pollutants, so when it is collected and stored long-term in coal ash ponds, there is increased risk of exposure to toxic metals.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Coal ash is highly flammable, and it is very hazardous to ship the materials to hazardous waste landfills.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators cannot remove fine particles like dust and smoke from the waste, so a secondary measure must be used.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Industrial scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators are very costly to install and increase the cost of operating coal-burning power plants, leading to increased costs for consumers.",
