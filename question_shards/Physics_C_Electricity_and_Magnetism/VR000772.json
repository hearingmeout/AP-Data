    "description": "Many literary works feature characters who approach the world from different perspectives and have different priorities. When these characters interact, the conflict arising from the characters’ differing values may have significant implications within the work.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which there are characters whose values and/or perspectives differ. Then, write a thesis statement that you might use for an essay that analyzes how the interaction between these characters contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Beneath your thesis statement, write a paragraph in support of your thesis that uses at least one piece of evidence from the text. Do not merely summarize the plot.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your interpretation.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your interpretation.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nThe Awakening\n\nThe Bonesetter’s Daughter\n\nThe Book of Salt\n\nBrave New World\n\nBreath, Eyes, Memory\n\nBrick Lane\n\nBrown Girl, Brownstones\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe Crucible\n\nDreaming in Cuban\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\n\nThe Gangster We Are All Looking For\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nGulliver’s Travels\n\nInterior Chinatown\n\nJasmine\n\nJulius Caesar\n\nLight in August\n\nThe Mayor of Casterbridge\n\nThe Namesake\n\nNative Son\n\nNative Speaker\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nThe Poisonwood Bible\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nA Raisin in the Sun\n\nSing, Unburied, Sing\n\nSong of Solomon\n\nA Tale of Two Cities\n\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God\n\nThere There\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nTopdog/Underdog\n\nWide Sargasso Sea\n\nWuthering Heights\n\nThe Year of the Flood",
