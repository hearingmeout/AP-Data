    "question": "Students in a class were divided into five groups to analyze community structure. Each group of students assessed the species of plants in four environments and determined the Simpson's Diversity Index for each environment. The Simpson's Diversity Index takes into account the number of species present as well as the abundance of each species. The index values are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Simpson's Diversity Index for four environments\n\nBased on the data in Figure 1, which of the following statements is most accurate about the species diversity of the four different environments that the students analyzed?",
