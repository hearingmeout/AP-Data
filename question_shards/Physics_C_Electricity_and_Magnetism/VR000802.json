    "description": "Fictional characters deal with feelings of guilt in different ways. Some shrug off guilt with apparent ease, while others suffer more from guilt than they do from external consequences imposed on them for their actions.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which a character changes—or remains unchanged—as a result of guilt. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how that character’s response contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents an interpretation and may establish a line of reasoning.\n\nSelect and use evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain the relationship between the evidence and your thesis.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nAdam Bede\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\n\nAll the King’s Men\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See\n\nThe Aspern Papers\n\nAtonement\n\nBeloved\n\nBrave New World\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nDeath Comes for the Archbishop\n\nDeath of a Salesman\n\nEast of Eden\n\nEthan Frome\n\nFences\n\nFrankenstein\n\nA Gesture Life\n\nGhosts\n\nGiovanni’s Room\n\nThe God of Small Things\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nHamlet\n\nInvisible Man\n\nJane Eyre\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nLight in August\n\nLong Day’s Journey Into Night\n\nLord Jim\n\nMacbeth\n\nNative Son\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nPortnoy’s Complaint\n\nThe Quiet American\n\nA Raisin in the Sun\n\nThe Remains of the Day\n\nRuth\n\nThe Scarlet Letter\n\nA Separate Peace \n\nThe Smell of Apples\n\nThe Sound and the Fury\n\nTess of the D’Urbervilles\n\nThe Yellow Birds",
