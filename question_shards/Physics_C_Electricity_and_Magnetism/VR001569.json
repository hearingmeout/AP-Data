    "question": "Zebra mussels are an invasive species that has become widely established throughout the United States. Figure 1 shows the percent change in the population sizes of selected groups of organisms in the Hudson River since the introduction of zebra mussels. In this study chlorophyll-containing bacteria are considered phytoplankton and all other bacteria are considered bacterioplankton.\n\nFigure 1. Change in biomass of selected Hudson River organisms after the introduction of zebra mussels\n\nWhich of the following hypotheses about the effect of zebra mussels on the Hudson River community is best supported by the data in Figure 1 ?",
