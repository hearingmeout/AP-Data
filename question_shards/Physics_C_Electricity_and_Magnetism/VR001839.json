    "description": "In an experiment to determine the effect of light availability on species richness in an environment, a grassland was divided into 26 plots that were assigned to one of two treatment groups:",
    "question": "1. Clipped – plots were mowed to simulate the grazing of herbivores that maintain the low height of grasses. 2. Enclosure – plots were enclosed in fences, and grasses were allowed to grow undisturbed to their maximum height. After eight years, data was collected on the amount of light penetration to the soil (bottom light density) and the number of species in the two treatment groups. Figure 1 shows the averaged light penetration measurements, and Figure 2 shows the averaged number of species per plot type. Figure 1. Average bottom light intensity in clipped plots versus enclosed plots Figure 2. Richness comparison of two treatments Which of the following statements is consistent with the data shown in the figures?",
