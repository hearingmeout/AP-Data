    "question": "Figure 1 shows the population fluctuations of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the eastern Pacific Ocean over the course of six years. The major dip in phytoplankton was attributed to a lack of nutrients for phytoplankton.\n\nFigure 1. Relative abundance of plankton over time in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean\n\nOf the following, which explains why the zooplankton also dipped during the same year and then seemed to cycle over the next three years?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The zooplankton rely on the same nutrients for energy harvesting as the phytoplankton, so their population was also unable to acquire the necessary energy to maintain their population level. After that major dip there were enough nutrients for both categories of plankton.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Zooplankton are more temperature-sensitive than the phytoplankton, so the annual seasonal changes will affect their population sizes in a cyclical fashion. There was a sudden, extreme temperature change in the first dip that also affected the phytoplankton.",

      {
        "label": "A migration of whales was blown off course by a storm one year and ate most of the phytoplankton and zooplankton. In the following years the whales returned to their normal migration route.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The reduction in the phytoplankton population meant that the zooplankton’s energy source was drastically reduced, leading to the decrease in the zooplankton population size. After the dip, the phytoplankton provided a steady energy source, and the zooplankton population fluctuated around its carrying capacity.",
