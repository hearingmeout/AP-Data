    "question": "A biologist is studying a small food web in which phytoplankton are eaten by krill, krill are eaten by fish, and fish are eaten by seals. During their study of the ecosystem, the biologist discovers that <math alttext=\"P C Bs\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>PCBs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> are present in measurable levels in the water and wants to examine how <math alttext=\"P C Bs\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>PCBs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> could vary in different trophic levels. Which of the following best identifies a testable hypothesis for the study?",
