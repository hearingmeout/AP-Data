    "question": "A loop of wire is entering a region that contains a magnetic field of magnitude <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> with an initial speed of <math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, as shown in the figure. The graph shows the magnitude of the electric field created in the loop as the loop enters the field. The electric field creates a counterclockwise current in the loop. Which of the following indicates how the loop is moving as it enters the field and the direction of the magnetic field?",
