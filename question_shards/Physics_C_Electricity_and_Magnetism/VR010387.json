    "description": "In an exercise to understand how genetically controlled physical traits could affect speciation, a theoretical population was imagined that contained organisms with three shapes and three levels of pigmentation, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
    "question": "Figure 1. A single population with individuals of different shapes and pigmentation Which of the following would most likely represent the types of individuals found in one of the species resulting from shape becoming a prezygotic isolating mechanism in the initial population represented in Figure 1 ?",
