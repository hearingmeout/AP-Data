    "question": "In an exercise to understand how genetically controlled physical traits could affect speciation, a theoretical population was imagined that contained organisms with three shapes and three levels of pigmentation, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. A single population with individuals of different shapes and pigmentation\n\nWhich of the following would most likely represent the types of individuals found in one of the species resulting from shape becoming a prezygotic isolating mechanism in the initial population represented in Figure 1 ?",
