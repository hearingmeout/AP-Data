    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's Sonnet 76 was published in 1609.\n\nWhy is my verse so barren of new pride?\n\nSo far from variation or quick change?\n\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\n\nTo new-found methods and to compounds strange?\n\n5Why write I still all one, ever the same,\n\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\n\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\n\nShowing their birth, and where they did proceed?\n\nO know, sweet love, I always write of you,\n\n10And you and love are still my argument;\n\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\n\nSpending again what is already spent:\n\nFor as the sun is daily new and old,\n\nSo is my love, still telling what is told.",
