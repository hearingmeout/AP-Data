    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nMaggie Anderson’s poem “Among Elms and Maples, Morgantown, West Virginia, August 1935” was published in 1986.\n\nAmong Elms and Maples, Morgantown, West Virginia, August 1935\n\nHouses are wedged between the tall stacks1smokestacks from a factory\n\nof Seneca Glass beside the Monongahela2a river that flows through Pennsylvania and West Virginia\n\nand waffle up steep hills. Here, the terrain\n\nallows photographers to appear acrobatic.\n\n5Walker Evans3Walker Evans (1903-1975) was an American photographer best known for his documentary work during the Great Depression. liked standing on a hill, focusing\n\ndown so it seemed he was poised on a branch.\n\nHe liked the single telephone pole against\n\nthe flat sky, crossed off-center like a crucifix.\n\nBeneath it, among elms and maples, is the house\n\n10my mother lived in with her sister and their mother\n\nnearly fifty years ago. In this shot, Evans\n\nonly wanted the rough surfaces of clapboard\n\nhouses, their meshed roofs and slanted gables.\n\nHe didn’t want my mother peeling the thin skin\n\n15from tomatoes with a sharp knife, my clumsy\n\nAunt Grace chasing the ones she’d dropped\n\naround the linoleum floor. That would be another\n\npicture, not this one. I look back from the future,\n\npast the undulating, unremitting line of hills\n\n20Evans framed my family in, through the shaggy fronds\n\nof summer ferns he used as foreground and as border.\n“Among Elms and Maples, Morgantown, West Virginia, August, 1935” 21 lines from Cold Comfort, by Maggie Anderson, © 1986.
