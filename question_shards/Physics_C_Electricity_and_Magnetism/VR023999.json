    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nAnne Sexton's poem \"Walking in Paris\" was published in 1966.\n\nWalking in Paris\n\nI come back to your youth, my Nana,\n\nas if I might clean off\n\nthe mad woman you became,\n\nwithered and constipated,\n\n5howling into your own earphone.\n\nI come, in middle age,\n\nto find you at twenty in high hair and long Victorian skirts\n\ntrudging shanks’ mare*on one’s own legs fifteen miles a day in Paris\n\nbecause you could not afford a carriage.\n\n10I have walked sixteen miles today.\n\nI have kept up.\n\nI read your Paris letters of 1890.\n\nEach night I take them to my thin bed\n\nand learn them as an actress learns her lines.\n\n15“Dear homefolks” you wrote,\n\nnot knowing I would be your last home,\n\nnot knowing that I’d peel your life back to its start.\n\nWhat is so real as walking your streets!\n\nI too have the sore toe you tend with cotton.\n\n20In Paris 1890 was yesterday\n\nand 1940 never happened—\n\nthe soiled uniform of the Nazi\n\nhas been unravelled and reknit and resold.\n\nTo be occupied or conquered is nothing—\n\n25to remain is all!\n\nHaving come this far\n\nI will go farther.\n\nYou are my history (that stealer of children)\n\nand I have entered you.\n\n30I have deserted my husband and my children,\n\nthe Negro issue, the late news and the hot baths.\n\nMy room in Paris, no more than a cell,\n\nis crammed with 58 lbs. of books.\n\nThey are all that is American and forgotten.\n\n35I read your letters instead,\n\nputting your words into my life.\n\nCome, old woman,\n\nwe will be sisters!\n\nWe will price the menus in the small cafés, count francs,\n\n40observe the tower where Marie Antoinette awaited her beheading,\n\nkneel by the rose window of Notre Dame,\n\nand let cloudy weather bear us home early\n\nto huddle by the weak stove in Madame’s kitchen.\n\nWe will set out tomorrow in stout shoes\n\n45to buy a fur muff for our blue fingers.\n\nI take your arms boldly,\n\neach day a new excursion.\n\nCome, my sister,\n\nwe are two virgins,\n\n50our lives once more perfected\n\nand unused.\n\n“Walking in Paris” from Live Or Die by Anne Sexton.
