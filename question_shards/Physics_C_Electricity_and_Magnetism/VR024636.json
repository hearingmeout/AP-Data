    "description": "Read the following carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nBliss Carman's poem \"Low Tide on Grand Pré\" was published in 1887.\n\nLow Tide on Grand Pré\n\nThe sun goes down, and over all\n\nThese barren reaches by the tide\n\nSuch unelusive glories fall,\n\nI almost dream they yet will bide\n\n5Until the coming of the tide.\n\nAnd yet I know that not for us,\n\nBy any ecstasy of dream,\n\nHe lingers to keep luminous\n\nA little while the grievous stream,\n\n10Which frets, uncomforted of dream,—\n\nA grievous stream, that to and fro\n\nAthrough the fields of Acadie1Acadie, Canada, is a coastal region with exceptionally low (ebb) and high (flood) tides.\n\nGoes wandering, as if to know\n\nWhy one beloved face should be\n\n15So long from home and Acadie!\n\nWas it a year or lives ago\n\nWe took the grasses in our hands,\n\nAnd caught the summer flying low\n\nOver the waving meadow lands,\n\n20And held it there between our hands?\n\nThe while the river at our feet—\n\nA drowsy inland meadow stream—\n\nAt set of sun the after-heat\n\nMade running gold, and in the gleam\n\n25We freed our birch2a canoe made of birch bark upon the stream.\n\nThere down along the elms at dusk\n\nWe lifted dripping blade to drift,\n\nThrough twilight scented fine like musk,\n\nWhere night and gloom awhile uplift,\n\n30Nor sunder soul and soul adrift.\n\nAnd that we took into our hands—\n\nSpirit of life or subtler thing—\n\nBreathed on us there, and loosed the bands\n\nOf death, and taught us, whispering,\n\n35The secret of some wonder-thing.\n\nThen all your face grew light, and seemed\n\nTo hold the shadow of the sun;\n\nThe evening faltered, and I deemed\n\nThat time was ripe, and years had done\n\n40Their wheeling underneath the sun.\n\nSo all desire and all regret,\n\nAnd fear and memory, were naught;\n\nOne to remember or forget\n\nThe keen delight our hands had caught;\n\n45Morrow and yesterday were naught!\n\nThe night has fallen, and the tide...\n\nNow and again comes drifting home,\n\nAcross these aching barrens wide,\n\nA sigh like driven wind or foam:\n\n50In grief the flood is bursting home!",
