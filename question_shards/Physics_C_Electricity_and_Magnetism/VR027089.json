    "description": "Wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1995. In addition to tracking changes in the wolf population, scientists were interested in how the wolves would affect other parts of the Yellowstone ecosystem. In particular, they were interested in changes to the population of elk, the wolves’ primary prey. The graph below shows the population size of the wolf and elk populations over time.",
