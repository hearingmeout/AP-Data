  "content": {
    "description": "Wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1995. In addition to tracking changes in the wolf population, scientists were interested in how the wolves would affect other parts of the Yellowstone ecosystem. In particular, they were interested in changes to the population of elk, the wolves’ primary prey. The graph below shows the population size of the wolf and elk populations over time.",
    "question": "Which of the following is a potential disadvantage of reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The wolves are causing a trophic cascade that could further increase the number of beavers and tree species such as willows and aspens.",

      {
        "label": "Wolves leaving the park may prey on livestock in grazing land outside the park.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Wolves are extremely fast breeders and may become an invasive species if they get outside the park.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The ecosystem could collapse because wolves were never in Yellowstone before 1995.",
