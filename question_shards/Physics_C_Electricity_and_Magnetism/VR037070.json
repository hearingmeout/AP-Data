    "description": "This question requires you to compare a Supreme Court case you studied in class with one you have not studied in class. A summary of the Supreme Court case you did not study in class is presented below and provides all the information you need to know about this case to answer the prompt.\n\nSan Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973)   \n\nIn 1968, members of the Edgewood Concerned Parent Association filed a lawsuit in a Texas District Court challenging that the system of using property taxes as the main source of revenue for school districts discriminated against poorer school districts. They provided evidence showing that wealthier schools serving primarily white students spent more money per pupil than poorer schools, especially those with minority populations. Without a wealthy tax base to fund their schools, they argued that poorer students’ Fourteenth Amendment rights were being violated.\n\nThe case was brought before the Supreme Court in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973). In a 5-4 decision, which was divided along ideological lines, the Supreme Court ruled that the students’ constitutional rights were not violated by the Texas school funding plan. In writing the majority opinion, Justice Powell stated that “the Texas plan is not the result of hurried, ill-conceived legislation. It certainly is not the product of purposeful discrimination against any group or class. On the contrary, it is rooted in decades of experience in Texas and elsewhere, and, in major part, is the product of responsible studies by qualified people.",
