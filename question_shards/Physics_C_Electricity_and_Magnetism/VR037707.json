Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. To prevent deer from running across highways, researchers are investigating sound-emitting devices that would frighten deer before they reach the highway. As part of the investigation, the researchers set up <math alttext=\"20\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> devices along a two-mile stretch of road. When a deer approached a device, the device would activate and emit a sound. The researchers recorded whether the deer moved toward the highway (positive response), away from the highway (negative response), or did not move (neutral response). The researchers kept the loudness of the sound constant at <math alttext=\"60\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>60</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> decibels. However, they varied the pitch of the sound.
