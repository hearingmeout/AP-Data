    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A small coffee shop sells freshly squeezed juices in a refrigerated unit with slots where juice is displayed. These slots are called facings. The manager of the coffee shop suspects that the distribution of juice sales is different than the distribution of facings for each type of juice, so the manager records the sales of each juice over a two-week period. The proportion of facings and the sales for each type of juice are shown in the tables.
