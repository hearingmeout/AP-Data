    "description": "Figure 1. Percentage of sea turtles that develop as females at different average nest temperatures. The bars represent the temperature range observed within the nests.\n\nSome green sea turtle females deposit their eggs in nests that are dug on warm, tropical beaches. Researchers have studied the effects of temperature on the hatching rate and the proportion of female to male hatchlings produced at different average nest temperatures in Suriname (Figure 1). At temperatures below <math alttext=\"23 degrees Celsius\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>23</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> or above <math alttext=\"33 degrees Celsius\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>33</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, the eggs do not develop.",
