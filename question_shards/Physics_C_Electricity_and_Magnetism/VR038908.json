    "description": "The hormone prolactin has varying effects in many different animal species. All vertebrates produce prolactin, which is involved in signal transduction pathways. In mammals, prolactin stimulates the production of milk in mammary glands. In fish, prolactin plays an important role in osmoregulation. In birds, prolactin is involved in lipid metabolism.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the presence of prolactin in various vertebrate species?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Though all vertebrates produce prolactin, its varied uses indicate it arose as a result of convergent evolution and not as a result of common ancestry.",

      {
        "label": "Prolactin is a homologous hormone because it has a common origin but different functions in various species.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Prolactin will bind only to intracellular receptors in animal species with phospholipid bilayers, so its effects are varied in different species.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because of different receptors activating different signal transduction pathways within the same species, it is likely that prolactin production is a trait with highly selective pressure.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "Prolactin is a homologous hormone because it has a common origin but different functions in various species."
