    "description": "Scientists compared the chemical structure of several molecules that various bacterial species use for quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is an ability some bacteria have to detect the number of related cells nearby. The chemical structure of some of these molecules found in certain species of bacteria are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. The chemical structure of several molecules used for quorum sensing in three species of bacteria",
    "question": "Which of the following research questions would best guide an investigation of the link between the structure of the signaling molecules and the evolution of quorum sensing?",
