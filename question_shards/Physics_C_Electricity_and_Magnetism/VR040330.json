    "description": "A scientist designed an experiment to test an artificial membrane that mimics the phospholipid bilayer of a cell.\n\nThe scientist built a tube that was divided by an artificial membrane and filled with distilled water. The scientist put a known amount of a protein into the water on one side of the membrane. After some time, the scientist measured the concentration of the protein on either side of the membrane but found that there had been no change.",
    "question": "Which of the following experimental changes would allow the scientist to observe transport of a solute across the artificial membrane?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Increase the solute concentration in the solution",
