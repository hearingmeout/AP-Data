    "description": "Many fish species, such as fathead minnows, release a pheromone when their skin cells are damaged. Researchers placed pike, a predator of fathead minnows, in a choice chamber and released the minnow pheromone at one end of the chamber. The researchers observed that the pike oriented themselves toward the end of the chamber where the pheromone was released.",
