Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.\n\nA student collected samples of cells from a woody plant during the spring and produced the drawings below. Sample 1 was collected from the woody stem of the plant. Sample 2 was collected from the root tip of the plant. Cells in different steps of mitosis are labeled with letters A, B, C, D, and E in Sample 2.\n\nFigure 1.
