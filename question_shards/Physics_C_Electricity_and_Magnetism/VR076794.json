    "description": "Climate Driving New Right Whale Movement\nNew research connects recent changes in the movement of North Atlantic right whales to decreased food availability and rising temperatures in Gulf of Maine’s deep waters. Right whales have been showing up in unexpected places in recent years, putting the endangered species at increased risk.…\n“The climate-driven changes rippling throughout the Gulf of Maine have serious consequences for the small number of remaining right whales,” said Nick Record, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences and lead author on the paper.…\nClimate change has shifted circulation patterns in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the currents that flow into the Gulf of Maine’s depths. This study found that some of these deep waters have warmed nearly 9 degrees Fahrenheit since 2004. These changes have drastically reduced the supply of right whale's primary prey—a high-fat, rice-sized crustacean called Calanus finmarchicus.…\nRight whales have historically made an autumn journey to the mouth of the Bay of Fundy to feast in preparation for winter. In the absence of abundant Calanus in that region, right whales are following their food—which means foraging well outside of the areas established to protect them.\nThe misalignment between conservation measures and the whales’ current behavior makes them much more vulnerable to lethal encounters with ships and fishing gear. However, the researchers believe that the strong connection between water temperature, Calanus, and right whales makes it possible to predict where new right whale habitats develop, and to plan accordingly.…Credit: Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences",
