    "description": "Climate Change Fills Storms With More Rain\nWhen a tropical storm is approaching, its intensity or wind speed often gets the bulk of the attention. But as  Tropical Storm Barry bears down on the Gulf Coast, it’s the water that the storm will bring with it that has weather watchers worried. . . .\nIn recent years, researchers have found that hurricanes have lingered longer . . . and dumped more rainfall — a sign of climate change, said Christina Patricola, a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and a co-author of a study that found that climate change is making tropical cyclones wetter. (Tropical cyclones include both hurricanes and tropical storms. . . .)\nResearchers have been studying the effects of climate change on tropical cyclones because those sorts of storms are driven by warm water. Water in the gulf is <math alttext=\"0.5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0.5</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> degrees Celsius warmer, according to Dr. [Andreas] Prein, [a project scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research] who said: “This is really increasing the likelihood of a hurricane to form in this basin. And it will increase the intensity of the hurricane as well.”\nThough storms can form at  any time, the Atlantic hurricane season stretches from June <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> through Nov. <math alttext=\"30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> because that is typically when the Atlantic Ocean’s waters are warm enough to sustain storms. But the oceans are now warmer than ever: They have absorbed more than <math alttext=\"90\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>90</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent of the heat caused by human-released greenhouse gas emissions. . . .\nThe researchers used climate models to simulate how tropical cyclone . . . wind speed and rainfall would change if hurricanes like Katrina, Irma and Maria had occurred absent of climate change and under future climate scenarios. They found that for all three storms, climate change increased rainfall by up to <math alttext=\"9\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent.\nThis study is not the first to find that climate change is causing tropical cyclones to have more rainfall. Studies on Hurricane Harvey found that climate change contributed as much as <math alttext=\"38\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>38</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent, or <math alttext=\"19\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>19</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> inches, of the more than <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>50</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> inches of rain that fell in some places. . . .\nAnd the structure of cities may exacerbate the problem even further, said Gabriele Villarini, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa.\nAt issue: Dirt absorbs water, but paved surfaces such as roads, sidewalks and even the footprint of building homes that make up cities don’t. The end result is that less water gets absorbed and the excess inevitably has to go somewhere. . . .\nDr. Villarini noted that in the case of Hurricane Harvey . . . there was “a huge amount of rainfall. And I’m struggling to think how you would design a city so that basically you would be able to zero out any effect of flooding.”\nFiguring out how to do that is something that researchers are working on. . . . What many scientists and experts agree on: As climate change increases extreme precipitation, cities will need to adapt.From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.
