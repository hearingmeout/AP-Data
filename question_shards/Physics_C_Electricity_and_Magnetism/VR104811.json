The horizontal axis is labeled “Chemical X Dose,” and three equally spaced categories for Low, Medium, and High, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Percent Mortality,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 50, are indicated. The data represented in the graph are as follows. The line begins near the origin and curves steeply upwards and to the right at an increasing rate, beginning to move more shallowly after the category for Medium on the horizontal axis and near the top of the vertical axis. A data point is shown on the horizontal axis before the category of Medium. A dotted line extends horizontally to the right from the a mortality rate of 50% on the vertical axis, intersects the line, and moves vertically downwards, touching a data point on the horizontal axis that is located before the category of Medium.",
