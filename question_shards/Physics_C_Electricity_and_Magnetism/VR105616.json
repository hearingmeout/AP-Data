    "description": "A common test for liver function involves sprinkling sulfur powder onto a sample of urine (mostly water with dissolved bodily waste). Sulfur powder sprinkled on a sample from an individual with impaired liver function will sink because the urine contains a high level of bile salts, while the sulfur powder sprinkled on normal urine samples will float.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains why bile salts cause the sulfur powder to sink?",
