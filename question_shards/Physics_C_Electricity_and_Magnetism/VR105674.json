    "description": "A researcher observes that when two heterozygous plants with red flowers are crossed, the resulting offspring include plants with red, white, or pink flowers. The researcher proposes the null hypothesis that flower color is the result of independent assortment and incomplete dominance. The researcher calculates a chi-square value of <math alttext=\"7.3\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>7.3</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>.",
    "question": "Assuming two degrees of freedom, which of the following is the correct interpretation of the chi-square analysis, using a <math alttext=\"p\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>p</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of <math alttext=\"0.05\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>0.05</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> ?",
