For paired groups of organisms, a comparison of the number of amino acid substitutions in cytochrome <math alttext=\"c\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mi>c</mi> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> with the time since the groups diverged from a common ancestor\n\nResearchers analyzed the amino sequence of the protein cytochrome <math alttext=\"c\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> in various groups of organisms and determined the number of amino substitutions that have occurred in the different groups of organisms. They plotted the data with respect to the time since divergence of the members of paired groups from a common ancestor (Figure 1).",
