    "description": "The brown anole (Anolis sagrei) is a species of lizard native to Cuba that has been introduced into the southeastern United States. The range of brown anoles in the United States has been expanding, and they are now competing with native green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). Some of the characteristics of the green and brown anoles are shown in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1.

    "question": "In anoles, small toe pads are better for gripping irregular surfaces such as the forest floor, and large toe pads are better for gripping smooth surfaces such as leaves. Based on the data in Table 1, if brown anoles are introduced into a forest where green anoles currently live, which of the following predictions about the two species is most likely?",
