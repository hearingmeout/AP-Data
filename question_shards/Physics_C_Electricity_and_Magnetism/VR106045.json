    "description": "High levels of certain plant nutrients in runoff can lead to rapid growth of algae (an algal bloom) in aquatic ecosystems. These algal blooms are generally followed by algal death and decomposition, which consumes large amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water and results in oxygen levels insufficient to support aerobic respiration. This process is known as eutrophication. The amount of algae present in a body of water can be estimated from the amount of chlorophyll a in a sample of the water. A researcher studying eutrophication collected samples at different times of the year in a freshwater ecosystem. The samples were analyzed for total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentration (Figure 1) as well as total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1. Amount of chlorophyll a in relation to the amount of total nitrogen\n Figure 2. Amount of chlorophyll a in relation to the amount of total phosphorous",
    "question": "Which of the following investigations would enable researchers to test the claim that an increased concentration of algae has a negative effect on the number of aquatic invertebrates in the ecosystem?",
