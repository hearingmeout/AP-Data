    "description": "Melanocytes are skin cells that can become cancerous and develop into a cancer known as melanoma. Some cancerous melanocytes have developed resistance to the drugs currently used to treat melanoma. As a result, researchers are investigating the effects of a new compound (drug <math alttext=\"X\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>X</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) on four different melanoma cell lines. Researchers analyzed cell survival in two cell lines (Figure 1) and oxygen consumption in the presence of drug <math alttext=\"X\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>X</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> in all four cell lines (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows the proposed mechanism by which drug <math alttext=\"X\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>X</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> affects cells.\n\nFigure 1.
