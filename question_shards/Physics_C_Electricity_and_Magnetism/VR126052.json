  "content": {
    "description": "A mutation in the gene coding for a single-polypeptide enzyme results in the substitution of the amino acid serine, which has a polar R group, by the amino acid phenylalanine, which has a nonpolar R group. When researchers test the catalysis of the normal enzyme and the mutated enzyme, they find that the mutated enzyme has much lower activity than the normal enzyme does.",
    "question": "Which of the following most likely explains how the amino acid substitution has resulted in decreased catalytic activity by the mutated enzyme?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The substitution decreased the mass of the enzyme so that the mutated enzyme binds more weakly to the substrate than the normal enzyme does.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The substitution altered the secondary and tertiary structure of the enzyme so that the mutated enzyme folds into a different shape than the normal enzyme does.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The substitution caused many copies of the mutated enzyme to cluster together and compete for substrate to bind.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The substitution caused the directionality of the enzyme to change such that the amino terminus of the normal enzyme has become the carboxy terminus of the mutated enzyme.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The substitution altered the secondary and tertiary structure of the enzyme so that the mutated enzyme folds into a different shape than the normal enzyme does."
