    "description": "The Devils Hole pupfish is one of the world’s rarest fishes, spending most of its life in the top few meters of very warm waters of a cavern located in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Devils Hole, a geologic pool, is the only naturally occurring habitat for the endangered Devils Hole pupfish. This fish's habitat is one of the smallest natural ranges known for any vertebrate. Devils Hole is an extreme environment, with water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations near the lethal limits for most fish species.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements best explains why the Devils Hole pupfish are able to live in this environment?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Climate change led to the death of other organisms at Devils Hole, reducing competition for the pupfish.",

        "label": "Thermal inversions have limited the species diversity at Devils Hole, and only a few fish species can survive the high temperatures.",

      {
        "label": "A trophic cascade in the Devils Hole food chain decreased the number of pupfish predators.",

    ],
    "answer": "The pupfish are well adapted to the habitat of Devils Hole and can thrive in conditions that are outside of the range of tolerance for most other species."
