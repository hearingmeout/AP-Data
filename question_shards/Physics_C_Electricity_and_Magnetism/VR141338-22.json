    "description": "Write your answers in the spaces provided. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.\n\nA textile company has started a program to recycle textiles so they are not added to a nearby landfill as part of the waste stream. The company collects old T-shirts, sorts them by color, breaks down the fibers, and respins the fibers into yarn, which is used to make new shirts. The recycling process is different from traditional manufacturing because it does not use dyes and it reduces the amount of water used in the manufacturing process to make new shirts.",
    "question": "Respond to parts A, B, C, D, E, and all subparts.\n\n(a) One drawback of traditional textile manufacturing is that it can release dyes into nearby rivers.\n\n(i) Identify an ecosystem service provided by rivers.\n\n(ii) Assuming the dyes are dark in color, describe how photosynthetic algae living in the water would be affected by the release of dyes into rivers.\n\n(iii) Textile dyes often contain heavy metals such as lead, chromium, and cadmium. Describe how heavy metals in nearby rivers could affect predators at the top of the food chain.",
