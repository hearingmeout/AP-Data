Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.\n\nThe Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is a species of mammal whose only wild population is native to the isolated island of Tasmania, off the coast of Australia. Tasmanian devils have a very low level of genetic diversity across the entire species. Researchers hypothesize this lack of diversity is the result of several genetic bottlenecks in the species’ history.\n\nIn 1996 a new disease called devil facial tumor disease (<math alttext=\"D F T D\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>DFTD</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>) appeared in the wild Tasmanian devil population. <math alttext=\"D F T D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>DFTD</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> can spread from one animal to another and causes the death of most affected animals. The impact of <math alttext=\"D F T D\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>DFTD</mtext> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> on the Tasmanian devil population has resulted in a decrease in the total population of more than 85% over the last two decades.",
