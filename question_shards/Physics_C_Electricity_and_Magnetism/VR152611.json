    "description": "Lactase is the enzyme needed to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. Most mammals produce lactase when they are young but stop once nursing ends. In humans however, many people continue to produce lactase into adulthood and are referred to as lactase-persistent.",
    "question": "Which of the following mutations is most likely to cause lactase persistence in humans?",
