    "description": "In pea plants, flower color and the length of the flower’s pollen grains are genetically determined. Researchers studying pea plants crossed homozygous dominant pea plants with homozygous recessive pea plants. The <math alttext=\"F 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> plants were then crossed, and the number of offspring with each phenotype was recorded. The researchers’ observed data, however, differed from the expected data. The researchers did a chi-square analysis and calculated the chi-square value to be <math alttext=\"5.5\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>5.5</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>.",
