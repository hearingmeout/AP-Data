    "description": "Belding’s ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) live in closely related groups. When they feed in the open, certain individuals (guard squirrels) watch for predators instead of feeding. The guard squirrels give an alarm call when a predator is sighted, allowing the rest of the group to run to safety. Researchers have noted that, because the alarm call draws attention to the guard, the guard is more likely to be caught by the predator and therefore has a lower survival rate in comparison with the other squirrels.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the behavior of the guard squirrels?",

      {
        "label": "The behavior of the guard squirrels increases the survival of close relatives that share the genes of the guard squirrels.",

        "label": "The guard squirrels confuse the predator, lowering the predator’s success rate because the predator cannot tell which squirrel is producing the sound.",

        "label": "Guard squirrels typically have recessive alleles, and by sacrificing themselves, they lessen the chance that recessive alleles will get passed on.",

      {
        "label": "Guard squirrels are typically females who have already reproduced, so they are no longer needed by the group.",

    ],
    "answer": "The behavior of the guard squirrels increases the survival of close relatives that share the genes of the guard squirrels."
