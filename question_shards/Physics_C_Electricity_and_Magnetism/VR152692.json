    "description": "Figure 1. Experimental steps taken to determine whether the nutrient source in a growth chamber affects mating preference\n\nA population of fruit flies (Drosophila pseudoobscura) grown on a typical nutrient source was separated into several growth chambers. Each of the new chambers was assigned a different source of carbohydrates for nutrition, either starch or maltose, and maintained for many generations (Figure 1).\n\nAfter a year, male and female flies were paired up in different combinations. The instances of mating between the males and females grown on the same nutrient source and males and females grown on different nutrient sources were recorded (Table 1).\n\nTABLE 1.
