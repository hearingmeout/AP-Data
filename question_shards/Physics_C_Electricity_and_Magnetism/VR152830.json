  "content": {
    "description": "Mosquitoes are frequently a target of insect control strategies because of their ability to spread disease. One strategy is to introduce guppies, a type of freshwater fish, into areas where mosquitoes are a problem. Guppies can consume large numbers of mosquito larvae, which cuts down on the number of mosquitoes living to adulthood.\n\nResearchers assessing the effectiveness of the guppy solution are concerned that the introduction of guppies might cause more problems than it is fixing. Guppies are hardy, tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions, and fast-reproducing.",
    "question": "Which of the following predicts the most likely ecological problem that would occur if guppies are introduced into new areas to control the mosquito population?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The guppies might have no natural predators, which will result in a dramatic increase in the guppy population and an increase in competition for other native species.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The guppy population will likely evolve to consume another food source instead of the mosquito larvae.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The larvae will evolve a mechanism that will enable them to avoid predation from the guppies.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Predators in the area will consume the guppies, requiring the addition of more guppies on a regular basis.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The guppies might have no natural predators, which will result in a dramatic increase in the guppy population and an increase in competition for other native species."
