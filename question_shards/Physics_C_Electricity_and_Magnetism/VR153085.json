    "description": "Sugar gliders and Northern flying squirrels are mammals that have many morphological similarities despite being genetically different. Both are nocturnal and have large eyes to help them see in the dark. Both live in trees and have flaps of skin connecting their front and back legs, and when their front and back legs are extended, the flaps allow the animals to glide from one tree branch to another. Sugar gliders are native to Australia, and Northern flying squirrels are native to North America.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the morphological similarities between these two species?",

      {
        "label": "The similarities in traits indicate the species are the result of divergent evolution from a common ancestor that had the same traits that these two species share.",

        "label": "The traits evolved through sympatric speciation, which often results in species being highly similar because they evolve in the same area.",

        "label": "The two species evolved as the result of two separate bottleneck events that reduced the existing populations to a few individuals who happened to have the same traits.",
