One species, Stylophora pistillata, has been found to thrive in water that is warmer and has a lower <math alttext=\"P H\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> than the water that corals typically thrive in. Additionally, researchers have found that the tolerance for the new water conditions is heritable.",
