    "description": "Pesticides are chemicals that are often sprayed on crops to kill plant-eating insects, preventing damage to the crops. While pesticides are effective initially, many researchers claim that any single pesticide will see reduced effectiveness in as little as ten to fifteen years.",
    "question": "Which of the following best supports the claim by scientists that the pesticides will eventually lose their effectiveness?",
