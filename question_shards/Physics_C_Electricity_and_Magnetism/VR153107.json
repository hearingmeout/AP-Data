    "description": "A massive increase in the growth of a specific species of algae resulted in record-breaking levels of a potentially dangerous toxin being released into the water. A researcher hypothesizes that the unusual growth of this algal species was caused by an increase in water temperature. The researcher designs an experiment to test the hypothesis.",
    "question": "Which of the following is the dependent variable in the researcher’s experiment?",
