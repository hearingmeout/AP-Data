Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is a single-celled, eukaryotic parasite that infects human cells in the digestive system and causes illness.\n\nAlthough it is a eukaryote, C. parvum does not have functional mitochondria and generates <math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> only through glycolysis. C. parvum uses the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase to perform fermentation after glycolysis.\n\nTwo chemicals, gossypol and <math alttext=\"F X 11\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>FX</mtext> <mn>11</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math>, are noncompetitive inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase. Researchers investigated the effectiveness of gossypol and <math alttext=\"F X 11\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>FX11</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> as drugs to kill C. parvum. In the experiment, human cells were treated with different concentrations of either gossypol or <math alttext=\"F X 11\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>FX</mtext><mn>11</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> after infection with C. parvum, and the relative growth of C. parvum compared with that of control cells was measured (Figures 1 and 2).\n\nFigure 1. Effect of different concentrations of gossypol on C. parvum growth\n Figure 2. Effect of different concentrations of <math alttext=\"F X 11\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mtext>FX</mtext> <mn>11</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> on C. parvum growth",
