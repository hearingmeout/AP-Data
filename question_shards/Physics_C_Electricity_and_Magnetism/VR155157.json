    "description": "Pitcher plants are carnivorous plants that grow in areas where the soil contains low levels of key nutrients such as nitrogen. To obtain these nutrients, most pitcher plants capture prey using traps containing a digestive fluid. The captured prey are then broken down and digested, and the pitcher plant absorbs the nutrients.\n\nThe traps of one species of pitcher plant, Nepenthes hemsleyana, do not contain digestive fluid. Instead they provide a suitable place for woolly bats (Kerivoula hardwickii) to sleep. The feces from the bat are released into the trap where nutrients in the feces are absorbed and provide the plant with the nitrogen it needs.",
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between the pitcher plant and the woolly bat?",
