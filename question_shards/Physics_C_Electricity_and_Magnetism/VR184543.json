    "description": "Anne Finch’s poem “To the Nightingale” was published in 1713.\n\nTo the Nightingale\n\nExert thy voice, sweet harbinger of spring!\n\nThis moment is thy time to sing,\n\nThis moment I attend to praise,\n\nAnd set my numbers to thy lays.\n\n5                     Free as thine shall be my song;\n\nAs thy music, short, or long.\n\nPoets, wild as thee, were born,\n\nPleasing best when unconfined,\n\nWhen to please is least designed,\n\n10                  Soothing but their cares to rest;\n\nCares do still their thoughts molest,\n\nAnd still th’ unhappy poet’s breast,\n\nLike thine, when best he sings, is placed against a thorn.\n\nShe begins, Let all be still!\n\n15                   Muse, thy promise now fulfill!\n\nSweet, oh! sweet, still sweeter yet\n\nCan thy words such accents fit,\n\nCanst thou syllables refine,\n\nMelt a sense that shall retain\n\n20                  Still some spirit of the brain,\n\nTill with sounds like these it join.\n\n’Twill not be! then change thy note;\n\nLet division1Elaborate variation on a melody shake thy throat.\n\nHark! Division now she tries;\n\n25                  Yet as far the Muse outflies.\n\nCease then, prithee, cease thy tune;\n\nTrifler, wilt thou sing till June?\n\nTill thy business all lies waste,\n\nAnd the time of building’s past!\n\n30               Thus we poets that have speech,\n\nUnlike what thy forests teach,\n\nIf a fluent vein be shown\n\nThat’s transcendent to our own,\n\nCriticize, reform, or preach,\n\n35              Or censure what we cannot reach.",
