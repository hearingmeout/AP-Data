    "description": "Richard Lovelace’s poem “The Grasshopper: To My Noble Friend, Mr. Charles Cotton” was published in 1649.\n\nThe Grasshopper: \n\nTo My Noble Friend, Mr. Charles Cotton\n\nO thou that swing’st upon the waving hair\n\nOf some well-fillèd oaten-beard,1Some species of oats feature long spikes that are thought to resemble hair.\n\nDrunk every night with a delicious tear\n\nDropped thee from heaven, where now thou art reared.\n\n5                    The joys of earth and air are thine entire,\n\nThat with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly;\n\nAnd when thy poppy works thou dost retire\n\nTo thy carved acorn-bed to lie.\n\nUp with the day, the sun thou welcom’st then,\n\n10                    Sport’st in the gilt-plaits2Braided golden hair of his beams,\n\nAnd all these merry days mak’st merry men,\n\nThyself, and melancholy streams.\n\nBut ah, the sickle! golden ears are cropped;\n\nCeres and Bacchus3The gods of the grain and the grape bid good-night;\n\n15         Sharp frosty fingers all your flowers have topped\n\nAnd what scythes spared, winds shave off quite.\n\nPoor verdant fool! and now green ice! thy joys,\n\nLarge and as lasting as thy perch of grass,\n\nBid us lay in ’gainst winter rain, and poise\n\n20                   Their floods with an o’er flowing glass.\n\nThou best of men and friends! we will create\n\nA genuine summer in each other’s breast;\n\nAnd spite of this cold time and frozen fate\n\nThaw us a warm seat to our rest.\n\n25              Our sacred hearths shall burn eternally\n\nAs vestal flames; the north-wind, he\n\nShall strike his frost-stretched wings, dissolve and fly\n\nThis Etna4Mount Etna is a volcano in Sicily. in epitome.\n\nDropping December shall come weeping in,\n\n30                       Bewail the usurping of his reign;\n\nBut when in showers of old Greek5Wine we begin\n\nShall cry he hath his crown again!\n\nNight as clear Hesper6The evening star shall our tapers whip\n\nFrom the light casements where we play,\n\n35      And the dark hag from her black mantle strip,\n\nAnd stick there everlasting day.\n\nThus richer than untempted kings are we,\n\nThat asking nothing, nothing need:\n\nThough Lord of all what seas embrace, yet he\n\n40                  That wants himself is poor indeed.",
