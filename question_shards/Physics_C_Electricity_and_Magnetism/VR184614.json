    "description": "This untitled poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay was published in 1923.\n\nPity me not because the light of day\n\nAt close of day no longer walks the sky;\n\nPity me not for beauties passed away\n\nFrom field and thicket as the year goes by;\n\n5Pity me not the waning of the moon,\n\nNor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,\n\nNor that a man’s desire is hushed so soon,\n\nAnd you no longer look with love on me.\n\nThis have I known always: Love is no more\n\n10Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,\n\nThan the great tide that treads the shifting shore,\n\nStrewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales:\n\nPity me that the heart is slow to learn\n\nWhat the swift mind beholds at every turn.\nEdna St. Vincent Millay, “Pity me not because the light of day” from Collected Poems.
