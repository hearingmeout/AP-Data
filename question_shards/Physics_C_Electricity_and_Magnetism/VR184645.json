    "question": "In Natasha Trethewey’s poem “Elegy,” published in 2012, the speaker remembers a day spent fishing with her father. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Trethewey uses literary elements and techniques to convey the speaker’s complex relationship with her father.\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nElegy\n\nfor my father\n\nI think by now the river must be thick\n\nwith salmon. Late August, I imagine it\n\nas it was that morning: drizzle needling\n\nthe surface, mist at the banks like a net\n\n5settling around us—everything damp\n\nand shining. That morning, awkward\n\nand heavy in our hip waders, we stalked\n\ninto the current and found our places—\n\nyou upstream a few yards, and out\n\n10far deeper. You must remember how\n\nthe river seeped in over your boots,\n\nand you grew heavy with that defeat.\n\nAll day I kept turning to watch you, how\n\nfirst you mimed our guide’s casting,1The act of throwing out a fishing line using a fishing rod\n\n15then cast your invisible line, slicing the sky\n\nbetween us; and later, rod in hand, how\n\nyou tried—again and again—to find\n\nthat perfect arc, flight of an insect\n\nskimming the river’s surface. Perhaps\n\n20you recall I cast my line and reeled in\n\ntwo small trout we could not keep.\n\nBecause I had to release them, I confess,\n\nI thought about the past—working\n\nthe hooks loose, the fish writhing\n\n25in my hands, each one slipping away\n\nbefore I could let go. I can tell you now\n\nthat I tried to take it all in, record it\n\nfor an elegy I’d write—one day—\n\nwhen the time came. Your daughter,\n\n30I was that ruthless. What does it matter\n\nif I tell you I learned to be? You kept casting\n\nyour line, and when it did not come back\n\nempty, it was tangled with mine. Some nights,\n\ndreaming, I step again into the small boat\n\n35that carried us out and watch the bank receding—\n\nmy back to where I know we are headed.\n“Elegy” from THRALL: Poems by Natasha Trethewey.
