The inner sphere carries a charge <math alttext=\"negative Q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> and the outer shell carries a charge <math alttext=\"positive Q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, as shown in the figure above.
