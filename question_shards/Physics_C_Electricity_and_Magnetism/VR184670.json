    "question": "A cylindrical resistor of resistance <math alttext=\"R sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> and length <math alttext=\"L sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> is created using a total volume <math alttext=\"V sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> of a flexible material with constant resistivity. The resistor is carefully stretched so that its volume does not change, it remains a cylinder, and its length doubles. Which of the following graphs best shows the resistance of the wire as a function of the length of the wire as the wire is stretched?",
