    "question": "A coaxial cable consists of a cylindrical wire inside of a cylindrical shell of wire. The inner wire has a current <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> directed into the page, and the outer wire has a current <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> out of the page. An electron has a velocity directed into the page, as shown in the figure above. What is the direction of the magnetic force exerted on the electron?",
