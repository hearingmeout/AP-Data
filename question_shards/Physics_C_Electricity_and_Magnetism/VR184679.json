Option <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> shows two wires, and all other options show a single wire. For all the configurations, the wires have a current <math alttext=\"I\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>.

The wire then moves vertically upward until it reaches the top dashed line, then moves horizontally to the right. The wire then moves vertically downward to the bottom dashed line, so that it is a distance d to the right of point P. The wire then continues moving horizontally to the right.",
