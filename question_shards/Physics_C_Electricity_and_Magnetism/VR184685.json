    "question": "A student is constructing a capacitor using two parallel plates and a dielectric. The student intends for the capacitance to be <math alttext=\"1 farad\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mtext> F</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. Once the capacitor is connected to a power supply and the charge is measured, the calculated value of the capacitance is only <math alttext=\"0.8 farad\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0.8</mn><mtext> F</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>. Which of the following is a possible reason for the discrepancy?",
