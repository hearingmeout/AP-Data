Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. Annual plants complete their life cycle, including germination, seed production, and death, within one year. Ambrosia trifida (giant ragweed) is an annual plant that readily colonizes any land that has had a disturbance such as plowing. The plant is considered an invasive species in regions outside of its native range. In a particular region, the seeds of A. trifida germinate from early March through the end of the summer, while the seeds of other annual plants require warmer soil temperatures and thus germinate from late April through the end of the summer. Researchers studied the influence of A. trifida on the biodiversity of other annual plant species that grow in the same field. In early spring, the researchers marked off identical plots of land in a field that had been plowed the previous fall and not replanted with new crops. All plants that grew on one half of the plots were left untouched (Figure 1A), while all germinating A. trifida seedlings were removed from the other half of the plots throughout the spring and summer (Figure 1B). In late summer, the researchers counted and identified all plants that grew in the plots. The distribution of plants is represented by the symbols in Figures 1A and 1B. Figure 1. Representations of plant identity and distribution in experimental plots in late summer. Each box represents one typical experimental plot, and each symbol represents <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>10</mtext></math> individual plants. (a) Describe a cause of logistic growth of the ragweed population.",
