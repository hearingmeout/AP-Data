    "description": "In Ai’s poem “The Man with the Saxophone,” published in 1985, the speaker encounters a man playing a saxophone. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Ai uses literary elements and techniques to convey the complexity of the speaker’s encounter with the saxophone player at that particular time and place.\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThe Man with the Saxophone\n\nNew York. Five A.M.\n\nThe sidewalks empty.\n\nOnly the steam\n\npouring from the manhole covers seems alive,\n\n5as I amble from shop window to shop window,\n\nsometimes stopping to stare, sometimes not.\n\nLast week’s snow is brittle now\n\nand unrecognizable as the soft, white hair\n\nthat bearded the face of the city.\n\n10I head farther down Fifth Avenue\n\ntoward the thirties,\n\nmy mind empty\n\nlike the Buddhists tell you is possible\n\nif only you don’t try.\n\n15If only I could\n\nturn myself into a bird\n\nlike the shaman1A spiritual leader who is believed to be endowed with magical powers I was meant to be,\n\nbut I can’t,\n\nI’m earthbound\n\n20and solitude is my companion,\n\nthe only one you can count on.\n\nDon’t, don’t try to tell me otherwise.\n\nI’ve had it all and lost it\n\nand I never want it back,\n\n25only give me this morning to keep,\n\nthe city asleep\n\nand there on the corner of Thirty-fourth and Fifth,\n\nthe man with the saxophone,\n\nhis fingerless gloves caked with grime,\n\n30his face also,\n\nthe layers of clothes welded to his skin.\n\nI set down my case,\n\nhe steps backward\n\nto let me know I’m welcome,\n\n35and we stand a few minutes\n\nin the silence so complete\n\nI think I must be somewhere else, not here,\n\nnot in this city, this heartland of pure noise.\n\nThen he puts the sax to his lips again\n\n40and I raise mine.\n\nI suck the air up from my diaphragm\n\nand bend over into the cold, golden reed,\n\nwaiting for the notes to come,\n\nand when they do,\n\n45for that one moment,\n\nI’m the unencumbered bird of my imagination,\n\nrising only to fall back\n\ntoward concrete,\n\neach note a black flower,\n\n50opening, mercifully opening\n\ninto the unforgiving new day.\n\n“The Man with the Saxophone.” Copyright © 1985 by Ai, from THE COLLECTED POEMS OF AI by Ai.
