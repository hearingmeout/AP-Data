Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples. Soil erosion is one of the most serious soil-degrading processes. Each year tons of soil erode from cropland, pastures, forests, and other places. The amount of erosion varies dramatically among various land-use types. The figure above shows the effects of different agricultural practices and slopes on annual erosion rates. (a) Refer to the graph above for the following. (i) Identify the scientific question that resulted in the data presented in the graph.",

Two methods to reduce sediment run-off in streams are to either put down straw bales or plant grass. The hypothesis to be tested is that straw bales reduce more sediment run-off than planted grass does. To test the hypothesis, two plots near a road under construction are measured. On one plot (<math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>), straw bales are used to cover the soil, while a second plot (<math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) is planted with grass. The sediment discharge from each plot is measured after rainfall.(i) Identify the dependent variable stated in the hypothesis.",
