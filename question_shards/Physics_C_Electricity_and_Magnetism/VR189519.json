    "question": "Read each question carefully. Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight. Students perform an experiment to study the force between two charged objects using the apparatus shown above, which contains two identical conducting spheres. The upper sphere is attached to an insulating string, which can be used to move the sphere downward. The lower sphere sits on an insulating rod, which is on an electronic balance. The electronic balance is zeroed before the lower sphere and insulating rod are in place. For the first trial, a charge of <math alttext=\"Q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is placed on each sphere and then the upper sphere is slowly moved downward. The students measure the distance <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> between the centers of the spheres and the magnitude <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of the force that appears on the electronic balance.
