    "description": "Researchers selected a random sample of <math alttext=\"100\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>100</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> students from a certain college to investigate whether students from the college who are sleep deprived will have lower reading-comprehension scores, on average, than students from the college who are not sleep deprived. Half the students from the sample were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received sleep restrictions, and the other half were assigned to a control group that received no sleep restrictions. The students were given a reading-comprehension test before the study began and at the end of two days. The mean score of the test for the treatment group was similar to that of the control group before the study. A <math alttext=\"95\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>95</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent confidence interval constructed from the difference in mean scores (treatment minus control) at the end of two days was <math alttext=\"negative 7.3 comma negative 1.5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>7.3</mn></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1.5</mn></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
