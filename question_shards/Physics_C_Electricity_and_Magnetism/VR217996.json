    "description": "In the early 2000s, prescription drug prices were rising at a level that made it hard for many people—especially seniors—to access affordable medicine. Elected officials from both parties agreed that legislation was necessary to address this problem, but they disagreed on the role that government, private insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies should play in the solution.\n\nIn 2003, Republican George W. Bush was president and Republicans held a majority in both the House and the Senate. Early that year, congressional Republicans drafted the first major overhaul in the history of Medicare, a federal health insurance program for seniors. Among other changes, this bill established “Medicare Part D,” which allowed seniors to purchase prescription drug plans from private companies and helped cover some of the costs for low-income individuals.\n\nThe House of Representatives narrowly passed the legislation, largely along party lines. Republicans overwhelmingly supported the legislation, with 207 voting in favor and 19 voting against. Democrats largely opposed the bill, with 9 voting in favor and 195 voting against. The Senate passed a different version of the legislation on July 7, 2003. The final bill was signed into law on December 8, 2003.",
