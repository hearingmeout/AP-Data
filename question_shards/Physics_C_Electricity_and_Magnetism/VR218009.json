    "description": "The number of people serving life sentences in American prisons has quadrupled over the past 35 years from 34,000 to an estimated 162,000. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), approximately 2,570 of those sentences were handed out to juveniles, some as young as thirteen years old.\n\nThe Supreme Court has addressed this issue in several cases. In Graham v. Florida (2010) the Supreme Court ruled that life sentences without the possibility of parole in crimes that do not involve the killing of another person constituted cruel and unusual punishment. In 2012, the Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama (2012) that all mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. At the time of the Miller decision, 29 states had sentencing laws that included mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for juveniles.\n\nThe Court’s decision in Miller raised the question about whether the decision applied to juveniles who received life sentences before the Court’s ruling. In 2016, the Court ruled in Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016) that the Miller decision did apply to all cases in which a juvenile received a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole before the Court’s decision in Miller. The Montgomery case has compelled states to hold resentencing hearings for juveniles who previously received a life sentence without parole.",
