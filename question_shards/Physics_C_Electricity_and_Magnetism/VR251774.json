Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. Glycogen is a complex polymer of glucose molecules involved in the storage of energy in many organisms. Depending on the signals received by a cell, different enzymes are activated, which will lead to either the synthesis or breakdown of glycogen. The product of glycogen breakdown, glucose <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>1-</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>phosphate, can be modified into glucose <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>6-</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis (Figure 1). Figure 1. Glycogen synthesis and breakdown In the liver, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase are regulated by kinases. These kinases transfer phosphate groups from <math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> to amino acids in glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase.

The activity of these kinases depends on the activation of signaling pathways in response to the binding of specific cell signals, including insulin and glucagon, to their receptors (Figure 2). Figure 2. A simplified model of signaling pathways in a liver cell that are activated by insulin and glucagon (a) A cell has a mutation that results in the permanent activation of the glucagon receptor, even in the absence of glucagon. Based on the information in Figure 2, predict the effect of this mutation on the activity of glycogen phosphorylase. Justify your prediction.",
