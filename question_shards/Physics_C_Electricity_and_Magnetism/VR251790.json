    "question": "Read each question carefully. Write your response in the space provided for each part of each question. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. Aquaporin channel proteins are found in the plasma membrane of various cell types. Scientists studied the production of aquaporins in the keratinocytes (skin cells) of healthy individuals and found that these proteins play a role in hydration of the skin. Some individuals have a skin disorder that causes the absorption of excess water by the skin of their hands and feet when they are soaked in water. Scientists determined that the keratinocytes of these individuals are characterized by the presence of abnormal aquaporins. Scientists studied a family in which some individuals have this skin disorder and constructed a pedigree (Figure 1). Figure 1. Pedigree of a human family in which some members have a skin disorder. An individual with an unknown phenotype is marked by a question mark. (a) Based on the pedigree in Figure 1, predict the probability that the individual marked by a \"<math alttext=\"question mark\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>?</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>\" will have the skin disorder. Justify your prediction.",
