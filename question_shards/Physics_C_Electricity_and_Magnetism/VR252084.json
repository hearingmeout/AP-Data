    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A manufacturer conducted a study to investigate whether a certain dental treat is effective in reducing the accumulation of plaque on the teeth of cats. The manufacturer randomly selected <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> cats from a cat sanctuary for the study. At the beginning of the study, each of the <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> cats had its teeth scored on a scale from <math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, with lower values indicating less plaque. The cats were then given the treats on a strict schedule, and after one month each cat had its teeth scored again using the same technique. All other variables were held constant over the one month period. The difference in the scores (before treat minus after treat) was recorded, and the results are shown in the following dotplot. (a) Explain what a positive difference indicates in the context of the study.",
