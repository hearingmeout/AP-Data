    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. An agriculturalist on a farm conducted a study to investigate whether ladybugs are effective in reducing damage caused by moths to the fruit of avocado trees. The agriculturalist randomly sampled <math alttext=\"66\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>66</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> avocado trees from the farm and paired them based on size. One tree from each pair was randomly assigned to a greenhouse with ladybugs, and the other tree in the pair was assigned to a greenhouse without ladybugs. After one month, the number of damaged avocado fruit on each tree was recorded. All other variables were held constant over the one month period. The difference in the number of damaged avocado fruit per tree pair (without ladybugs minus with ladybugs) was calculated for each of the <math alttext=\"33\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>33</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> pairs and is shown in the stemplot. (a) Explain what a positive difference indicates in the context of the study.",
