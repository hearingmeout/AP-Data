Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Consider a study designed to investigate the following claim. A medicated eye drop is effective in relieving itchy eyes. Two designs are proposed for the study. Plan A: Obtain <math alttext=\"240\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>240</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers from the population of people with itchy eyes. Randomly assign <math alttext=\"160\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>160</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> of the volunteers to use the medicated eye drop each day. Assign the remaining <math alttext=\"80\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>80</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers to use a placebo each day. Observe the number of people who experience relief in each group after one week. Plan B: Randomly select <math alttext=\"240\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>240</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> people from the population of people with itchy eyes to use the medicated eye drop each day and observe the number of people who experience relief after one week. (a) Give an example of what people assigned to use a placebo in Plan A might be asked to use instead of the medicated eye drop. Explain the benefit of the placebo in the context of the study.",
