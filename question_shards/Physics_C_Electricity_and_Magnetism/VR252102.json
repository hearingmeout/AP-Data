Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A vehicle manufacturer is developing software for its self-driving vehicle. If the software detects that the vehicle is unintentionally deviating from its lane, the software will signal the vehicle to perform a corrective maneuver to remain in the lane. The manufacturer plans to investigate the performance of two different software programs (X and Y) across its large fleet of self-driving vehicles. A random sample of <math alttext=\"50\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>50</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> vehicles was selected from the manufacturer’s fleet of self-driving vehicles and both software programs were installed in each vehicle. The vehicles were driven and the difference in software reliability scores, measured by the difference in the proportion of corrective maneuvers appropriately signaled, was recorded for each vehicle at the end of two weeks. The histogram shows the distribution of the differences in software reliability scores (X minus Y) for the <math alttext=\"50\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>50</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> vehicles.
