A group of students are to experimentally determine the mass <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of a nonconducting ball of known charge <math alttext=\"q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> using the experimental setup shown in the diagram. A variable power supply is connected to two large parallel conducting plates. The charged ball hangs between the plates on an insulated string and comes to equilibrium while hanging at an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to the vertical, as shown. The students are expected to determine the mass of the ball by plotting their data in a graph. The students have access to equipment commonly found in a high school physics laboratory, but the experiment must use the setup shown above. (a) Clearly identify each quantity to be measured, the symbol used to represent that quantity, and the equipment that would be used to measure the quantity.",
