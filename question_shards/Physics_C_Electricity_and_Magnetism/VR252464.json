The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nWithout using a meterstick or similar tool, a group of students are to experimentally determine the distance <math alttext=\"d\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> between two horizontal conducting plates by plotting data in a graph. Small nonconducting spheres of varying masses <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> but identical charge <math alttext=\"q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> are able to drop into the space between the horizontal plates through a small hole in the top plate, and come to rest, as shown. The horizontal parallel plates are connected to a variable high-voltage power supply, and the charge of each sphere is determined with an available electrometer. In addition to the equipment described, students have access to equipment typically found in a high school physics laboratory, but the experiment must use the setup shown above.\n\n(a) Clearly identify each quantity to be measured, the symbol used to represent that quantity, and the equipment that would be used to measure the quantity.",
