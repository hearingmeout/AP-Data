    "question": "Read each part carefully. Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight. Four identical light bulbs A, B, C, and D are connected to an ideal battery. The connections between the light bulbs and the battery are hidden in a container, as shown in the figure. A group of students are asked to make observations about the behavior of the light bulbs and determine how the bulbs are connected inside the container. The students measure the brightness, in lumens (lm), at a constant distance from each bulb with a light meter and record their observations in the data table below. Conditions Brightness of Bulb A (lm) Brightness of Bulb B (lm) Brightness of Bulb C (lm) Brightness of Bulb D (lm) All bulbs connected 62.5 62.5 62.5 62.5 Only bulb A is removed 0 27.8 111.1 27.8 Only bulb B is removed 27.8 0 27.8 111.1 Only bulb C is removed 111.1 27.8 0 27.8 Only bulb D is removed 27.8 111.1 27.8 0 Bulbs B and C are removed 62.5 0 0 62.5 Bulbs B and D are removed 0 0 0 0 (a) Which of the circuit diagrams shown above correctly represents the configuration of the bulbs?",
