The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nFour identical light bulbs A, B, C, and D are connected to an ideal battery. The connections between the light bulbs and the battery are hidden in a container, as shown in the figure. A group of students are asked to make observations about the behavior of the light bulbs and determine how the bulbs are connected inside the container. The students measure the brightness, in lumens (lm), at a constant distance from each bulb with a light meter and record their observations in the data table below.\n\nConditions\n Brightness of Bulb A (lm)\n Brightness of Bulb B (lm)\n Brightness of Bulb C (lm)\n Brightness of Bulb D (lm)\n\nAll bulbs connected\n 62.5\n 62.5\n 62.5\n 62.5\n\nOnly bulb A is removed\n 0\n 27.8\n 111.1\n 27.8\n\nOnly bulb B is removed\n 27.8\n 0\n 27.8\n 111.1\n\nOnly bulb C is removed\n 111.1\n 27.8\n 0\n 27.8\n\nOnly bulb D is removed\n 27.8\n 111.1\n 27.8\n 0\n\nBulbs B and C are removed\n 62.5\n 0\n 0\n 62.5\n\nBulbs B and D are removed\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n\n(a) Which of the circuit diagrams shown above correctly represents the configuration of the bulbs?",
