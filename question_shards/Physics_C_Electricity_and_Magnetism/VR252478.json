    "question": "Read each part carefully. Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nA group of engineers are asked to design a very bright light bulb that is to be used on airport runways. The filament in the light bulb dissipates electrical energy as light and thermal energy. The engineers can choose filaments of varying thicknesses, lengths, and materials, and connect the bulb to a variable power supply, shown in the figure.\n\n(a) A student correctly claims that for the same potential difference across the bulb, a greater current in the bulb corresponds to a greater amount of electrical energy dissipated by the bulb each second. Justify this claim in terms of charge.",
