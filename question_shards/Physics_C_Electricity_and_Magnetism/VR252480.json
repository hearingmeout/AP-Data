    "question": "Read each part carefully. Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight. A group of students are to experimentally determine the resistivity of thin copper wire using the setup shown. The setup includes a battery of voltage <math alttext=\"script uppercase E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>ε</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and a resistor <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of known resistance. There are several samples of thin copper wire of different lengths available for the students to use. All samples of the wire have the same known diameter. The students are expected to find the resistivity by plotting their data in a graph. The students have access to an ammeter and a voltmeter as well as other equipment typically found in a high school physics lab but must use the setup shown above. (a) Clearly identify each quantity to be measured, the symbol used to represent that quantity, and the equipment that would be used to measure the quantity.",
