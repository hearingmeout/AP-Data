The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nA group of students are to experimentally determine if a length of pencil lead is an ohmic conductor at room temperature. Their setup includes a battery of voltage <math alttext=\"script uppercase E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>ε</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, several resistors that each have of resistance <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, the pencil lead with length <math alttext=\"L\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, and connecting wires. The students are not expected to break the pencil lead. The students are expected to determine if the pencil lead is ohmic by plotting their data in a graph. The students have access to an ammeter and a voltmeter as well as other equipment typically found in a high school physics lab but must use a setup similar to the one shown above.\n\n(a) Clearly identify each quantity to be measured, the symbol used to represent that quantity, and the equipment that would be used to measure the quantity.",
