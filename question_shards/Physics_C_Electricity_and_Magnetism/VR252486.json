The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nA group of students are to experimentally determine the capacitance <math alttext=\"C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of capacitor in a circuit as shown.

In addition, there are several different resistors that are available for the students to use. The students are expected to collect data as the capacitor is discharging and then find the capacitance through graphical analysis. The students have access to equipment typically found in a high school physics lab but must use a setup similar to the one shown above.\n\n(a) Clearly identify each quantity to be measured, the symbol used to represent that quantity, and the equipment that would be used to measure the quantity.",
