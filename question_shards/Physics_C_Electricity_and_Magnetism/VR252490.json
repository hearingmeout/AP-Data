A belt capable of transporting electric charge is connected by a motor to a spherical conducting surface of radius <math alttext=\"uppercase R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. The motor and conducting surface are separated by an insulating stand.

After the sphere has been charged, an uncharged conducting ball of radius <math alttext=\"lowercase r\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> hanging from a nonconducting string is brought close to, but not touching, the sphere.

The height of the ball is adjusted such that the center of the ball and the sphere are at the same vertical height, as shown.
