    "description": "In fruit flies of the genus Drosophila, the allele for vestigial wings is recessive to the allele for round wings, and the allele for brown eye color is recessive to the allele for red eye color. A scientist crossed flies that are heterozygous for both traits and determined the number of offspring with each combination of phenotypes. The scientist performed a chi-square analysis to determine if the data are consistent with the expectations for independent assortment. The chi-square calculated value for the experiment was <math alttext=\"6.03\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6.03</mn></math>.",
    "question": "Based on the chi-square calculated value, which of the following statements is most accurate?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The chi-square calculated value is greater than the chi-square critical value; therefore the null hypothesis should be rejected.",
