The genes of the <math alttext=\"t r p\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext mathvariant=\"italic\">trp</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> operon are actively expressed (Figure 1A) unless abundant tryptophan is present in the environment. When tryptophan is abundant, some tryptophan binds to the <math alttext=\"t r p\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext mathvariant=\"italic\">trp</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> repressor protein, which in turn causes the repressor to bind to the operator and block transcription of the genes (Figure 1B). The repressor protein is encoded by the <math alttext=\"t r p uppercase R\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext mathvariant=\"italic\">trpR</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> gene which is not a part of the <math alttext=\"t r p\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext mathvariant=\"italic\">trp</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> operon.\n\nFigure 1A.
