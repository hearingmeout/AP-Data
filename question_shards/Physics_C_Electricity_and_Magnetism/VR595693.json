    "question": "Human epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a protein that stimulates cell division and growth by binding to its receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<math alttext=\"H E R 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>HER</mi><mn>2</mn></math>). Certain types of cancer are caused when the overexpression of EGF activates a cell-signaling pathway, leading to uncontrolled cell division.\nWhich of the following best explains how a drug can be used to inhibit tumor growth caused by EGF overexpression?",
