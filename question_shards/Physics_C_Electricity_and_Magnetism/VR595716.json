    "description": "Figure 1. Rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction\n\nResearchers investigated the dynamics of a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme. The researchers prepared a series of reactions, each with the same concentration of enzyme but with different concentrations of substrate. The researchers measured the amount of product in each reaction mixture after <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> minutes. The results are shown in Figure 1.",
