    "question": "In some species of bats, adult females regurgitate (bring up food from the stomach) to feed their young. In addition, adult bats regurgitate to feed other adults that have not recently eaten. The adults receiving the food may be unrelated bats who have previously participated in food sharing and are members of the same social group. Scientists claim that sharing among unrelated adult bats increases the fitness of the species.\nWhich of the following best supports the scientists’ claim?",
