    "question": "In a region of Africa where malaria is common, <math alttext=\"9%\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>9</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the population is born with a severe form of sickle-cell anemia (<math alttext=\"Lowercase s lowercase s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext mathvariant=\"italic\">ss</mtext></math>). Carriers of the sickle-cell allele (heterozygotes) are resistant to malaria and display only mild symptoms of malaria if exposed to the malaria parasite. If an effective antimalarial program is instituted in the region, which of the following is most likely to occur over many generations?",
