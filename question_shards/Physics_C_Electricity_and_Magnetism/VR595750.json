    "question": "Old World vultures are birds that have digestive systems that enable them to feed mainly on carrion (dead animals). They have large wings used to soar as they search for dead animals with their vision. New World vultures have similar digestive systems and wingspans; however, they search for food using their sense of smell. Old World vultures and New World vultures are not closely related.\nWhich of the following best explains how Old World vultures and New World vultures both evolved to feed mainly on carrion?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Old World vultures and New World vultures had a common ancestor that fed mainly on carrion, and this trait was selected for in populations of New World and Old World vultures.",

        "label": "Old World vultures and New World vultures were exposed to similar selective pressures, which contributed to the independent evolution of carrion feeding in two separate lineages.",

      {
        "label": "Old World vultures and New World vultures have similar digestive systems, which drove them to consume a food source that was not available to other bird species.",
