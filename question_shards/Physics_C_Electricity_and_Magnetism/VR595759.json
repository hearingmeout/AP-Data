    "description": "Decades of seal hunting eliminated many fur seal breeding colonies. Since that time, fur seals have recolonized several islands in the Pacific Ocean. Scientists studying the populations of fur seals on three recently colonized islands observed different population growth rates among the three populations.",
    "question": "Which of the following best explains the different population growth rates on the recently colonized islands?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The islands differed in the number of predators of seals in the surrounding waters, resulting in lower growth rates on islands with fewer predators nearby.",
