Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.\n\nA population of invasive feral hogs in a wilderness area is approaching carrying capacity. The feral hogs in each age-group of this population are counted once a year. Figure 1 shows the age pyramid of this population in one particular year. Feral hogs reproduce between <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> years of age. Mothers care for their young until the young are three months old.\n\nFigure 1. Age pyramid of a feral hog population in a wilderness area\n\nTen years later a researcher again counts the number of individual feral hogs in each age-group in the same population and produces the age pyramid shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Age pyramid of the feral hog population ten years later\n\n(a) Describe a characteristic of an ecosystem that allows an introduced species to become an invasive species.",
