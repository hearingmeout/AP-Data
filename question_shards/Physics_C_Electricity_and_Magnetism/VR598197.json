    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nAlexander Lawrence Posey’s poem “My Hermitage” was published in 1900.\n\nMy Hermitage1the secluded dwelling of a hermit\n\nBetween me and the noise of strife\n\nAre walls of mountains set with pine;\n\nThe dusty care-strewn paths of life\n\nLead not to this retreat of mine.\n\n5I live with Echo and with Song,\n\nAnd Beauty leads me forth to see\n\nHer temple’s colonnades,2a row of columns supporting a roof and long\n\nTogether do we love to be.\n\nThe mountains wall me in complete,\n\n10                And leave me but a bit of blue\n\nAbove. All year, the days are sweet—\n\nHow sweet! And all the long nights thro’\n\nI hear the river flowing by\n\nAlong its sandy bars;\n\n15Behold, far in the midnight sky,\n\nAn infinite of stars!\n\n’Tis sweet, when all is still,\n\nWhen darkness gathers round,\n\nTo hear, from hill to hill,\n\n20            The far, the wandering sound.\n\nThe cedar and the pine\n\nHave pitched their tents with me.\n\nWhat freedom vast is mine!\n\nWhat room of mystery!\n\n25And on the dreamy southern breeze,\n\nThat steals in like a laden bee\n\nAnd sighs for rest among the trees,\n\nAre far-blown bits of melody.\n\nWhat afterglows the twilights hold,\n\n30          The darkening skies along!\n\nAnd O, what rose-like dawns unfold,\n\nThat smite the hills to song!\n\nHigh in the solitude of air,\n\nThe gray hawk circles on and on,\n\n35Till, like a spirit soaring there,\n\nHis image pales and he is gone!",
