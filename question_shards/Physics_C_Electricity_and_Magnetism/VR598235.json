    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nThis sonnet by William Shakespeare was published in 1609.\n\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\n Who with his fear is put besides his part,\n Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\n Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart,\n5So I, for fear of trust, forget to say\n The perfect ceremony of love’s rite,\n And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,\n O’ercharg’d with burthen of mine own love’s might.\n O, let my books be then the eloquence\n10And dumb presagers1warnings of my speaking breast,\n Who plead for love, and look for recompense,\n More than that tongue that more hath more express’d.\n O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:\n To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.",
