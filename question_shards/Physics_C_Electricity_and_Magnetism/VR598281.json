    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nMercedes de Acosta’s poem “Life and Youth” was published in 1921.\n\nLife and Youth\n Through the archways of Life I tread,\n Nor do I walk with much less dread,\n Because I know\n That where I go,\n5Millions have walked before me.\n\nI do not feel less pain because ’tis said,\n That saints and martyrs and soldiers have bled\n For what they gave.\n I am not brave\n10Because of this.\n\nI weep not less,\n Because in distress\n Others, perhaps being stronger, have not wept as much;\n For Stoics,1members of a school of philosophy who hold the belief that one should be free from passion and unmoved by joy or grief and tearless people, and because of such\n15Restraint, I hold not back my tears.\n\nI borrow not my courage from the crowd.\n My heart is heavy and my head is bowed—\n But were I to raise my head high,\n And cast my eyes up to the sky,\n20A star might guide me.\n\nI cannot be what has been,\n I cannot see what’s been seen.\n I shape my course,\n And gather force,\n25From what’s to come.\n\nThe future is my golden star,\n My inspiration—and from afar,\n I see the deeds that may be done,\n I watch a race that may be run,\n30And hold my breath in ecstasy.\n\nAway! Black shadows of the past,\n Stale traditions that hold us fast.\n Because they were,\n Must we not stir\n35From off their worn out path?\n\nI take up the spade of Youth and of Life,\n And fling new pebbles on the path, where strife\n Has worn the old ones out.\n I dig and put to rout,2“Put to rout” is an expression meaning force out.\n40Old fancies and old doubt.\n\nAcross the world I hear a clear, new note;\n The locks are shattered and the chains are smote,\n And a moonbeam has fallen across life’s shoulder.\n I raise my sword, and like a pioneer soldier,\n45I sharpen it on the Shield of Hope.",
