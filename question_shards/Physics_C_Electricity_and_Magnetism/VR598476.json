    "description": "Many works of literature feature characters who accept or reject a hierarchical structure. This hierarchy may be social, economic, political, or familial, or it may apply to some other kind of structure.\n\nEither from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which a character responds to a hierarchy in some significant way. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how that character’s response to the hierarchy contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot.\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nProvide evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThe Bluest Eye\n\nBrighton Rock\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe Dispossessed\n\nDominicana\n\nThe Dragon Can’t Dance\n\nEast of Eden\n\nFahrenheit 451\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nHope Leslie\n\nThe House of the Spirits\n\nThe Hummingbird's Daughter\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nThe Inheritance of Loss\n\nInvisible Man\n\nJane Eyre\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nLove Medicine\n\nThe Mill on the Floss\n\nNative Son\n\nThe Nickel Boys\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four\n\nOn Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous\n\nOn Such a Full Sea\n\nOthello\n\nParable of the Sower\n\nA Passage to India\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\n\nPurple Hibiscus\n\nA Raisin in the Sun\n\nRobinson Crusoe\n\nThe Scarlet Letter\n\nSweat\n\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nVanity Fair\n\nWhite Tiger\n\nThe Women of Brewster Place\n\nWuthering Heights",
