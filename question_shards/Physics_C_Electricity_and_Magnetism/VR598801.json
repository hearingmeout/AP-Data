    "description": "This question requires you to compare a Supreme Court case you studied in class with one you have not studied in class. A summary of the Supreme Court case you did not study in class is presented below and provides all of the information you need to know about this case to answer the prompt.\n\nUnited States v. Eichman (1990)\n\nAfter the Supreme Court held that a state law in Texas that criminalized the desecration of the American flag was unconstitutional, Congress passed a national law, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which criminalized the conduct of anyone who “knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon” a flag of the United States.\n\nIn response to this law, protest demonstrations took place in several locations across the country. Several people, including Shawn Eichman, burned flags on the steps of the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C., before a crowd of reporters and photographers. Eichman and others were arrested for violating the Flag Protection Act.\n\nIn the ensuing cases, Eichman and others defended their actions as legitimate forms of political protest. Federal district judges dismissed the charges, but United States attorneys appealed the decisions directly to the Supreme Court. These cases were consolidated in United States v. Eichman (1990).\n\nIn United States v. Eichman (1990), the Supreme Court’s 5–4 decision held that the federal government cannot prosecute a person for desecration of the American flag because doing so would violate the First Amendment.",
