    "description": "In Robert Burns’s poem “On Scaring Some Waterfowl in Loch Turit,” written in 1787, the speaker considers why waterfowl leave a lake upon his arrival. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Burns uses literary elements and techniques to develop a complex comparison between the waterfowl and humans.\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nOn Scaring Some Waterfowl in Loch Turit1a lake in central Scotland\n\nWhy, ye tenants of the lake,\n\nFor me your wat’ry haunt forsake?\n\nTell me, fellow-creatures, why\n\nAt my presence thus you fly?\n\n5Why disturb your social joys,\n\nParent, filial,2relating to a son or daughter kindred ties?—\n\nCommon friend to you and me,\n\nNature’s gifts to all are free:\n\nPeaceful keep your dimpling wave,\n\n10Busy feed, or wanton lave;3bathing\n\nOr, beneath the sheltering rock,\n\nBide the surging billow’s shock.\n\nConscious, blushing for our race,\n\nSoon, too soon, your fears I trace.\n\n15Man, your proud, usurping foe,\n\nWould be lord of all below;\n\nPlumes himself in Freedom’s pride,\n\nTyrant stern to all beside.\n\nThe eagle, from the cliffy brow,\n\n20Marking you his prey below,\n\nIn his breast no pity dwells,\n\nStrong Necessity compels.\n\nBut Man, to whom alone is giv’n\n\nA ray direct from pitying Heav’n,\n\n25Glories in his heart humane—\n\nAnd creatures for his pleasure slain.\n\nIn these savage, liquid plains,\n\nOnly known to wand’ring swains,4rustic workers\n\nWhere the mossy riv’let strays,\n\n30Far from human haunts and ways;\n\nAll on Nature you depend,\n\nAnd life’s poor season peaceful spend.\n\nOr, if man’s superior might\n\nDare invade your native right,\n\n35On the lofty ether5upper regions of space borne,\n\nMan with all his pow’rs you scorn;\n\nSwiftly seek, on clanging wings,\n\nOther lakes, and other springs;\n\nAnd the foe you cannot brave,\n\n40Scorn at least to be his slave.",
