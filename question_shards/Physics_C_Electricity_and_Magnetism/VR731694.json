    "description": "An experiment was conducted to assess the effect of baking temperature on the density of bread. A large batch of white bread dough and a large batch of whole wheat bread dough were prepared. Each of the batches was formed into <math alttext=\"18\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>18</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> loaves, resulting in a total of <math alttext=\"36\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>36</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> loaves. Each of the white bread loaves was randomly assigned to one of three baking temperatures (low, medium, and high), so that <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> loaves were baked at the low temperature, <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> were baked at the medium temperature, and <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> were baked at the high temperature. A similar process of random assignment was carried out for the whole wheat bread loaves.",
