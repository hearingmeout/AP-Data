    "description": "Carol, a reporter in a large city, took a random sample of <math alttext=\"300\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>300</mn></math> households and found that the <math alttext=\"90\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>90</mn></math> percent confidence interval for the proportion of households that own a pet is <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 0.63 comma 0.71, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mn>0.63</mn></mpadded><mo>,</mo><mpadded><mn>0.71</mn></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math>. Jason, the director of a local animal shelter, wants to verify this result for the proportion of households that own a pet and takes a different random sample of <math alttext=\"200\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>200</mn></math> households and finds that <math alttext=\"67\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>67</mn></math> percent own a pet.",
    "question": "Assume the conditions for inference have been met. Jason will calculate a <math alttext=\"90\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>90</mn></math> percent confidence interval for the proportion of households that own a pet using his sample data. How would the margin of error from Jason's confidence interval compare to the margin of error from Carol's confidence interval?",
