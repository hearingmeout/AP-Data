    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A large airport has parking spaces spread among <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math> types of parking lots. The cost to park a car per day differs from lot to lot depending on the time it takes to get to the airport terminal. The parking lots are described as follows. Premium parking is less than a <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math>-minute walk to the airport terminal. Premium parking spaces account for <math alttext=\"15\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>15</mn></math> percent of the total number of airport parking spaces. General parking is a <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math>- to <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>-minute walk to the airport terminal. General parking spaces account for <math alttext=\"29.5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>29.5</mn></math> percent of the total number of airport parking spaces. Economy parking is a <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>- to <math alttext=\"15\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>15</mn></math>-minute walk to the airport terminal. Economy parking spaces account for <math alttext=\"37\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>37</mn></math> percent of the total number of airport parking spaces. Off-site parking uses a shuttle that operates every <math alttext=\"15\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>15</mn></math> minutes to transport people from the off-site parking lot to the airport terminal. Off-site parking spaces account for <math alttext=\"18.5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>18.5</mn></math> percent of the total number of airport parking spaces. Tens of thousands of drivers park in the airport’s parking lots each year. A random sample of <math alttext=\"343\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>343</mn></math> drivers who park in the airport’s parking lots is selected during a given year, and each driver is asked where they would choose to park if all parking lot options were available to them. Airport officials counted the number of responses for each type of parking lot, and the results are summarized in the table. Type of Parking Lot Number of Responses Premium <math alttext=\"63\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>63</mn></math> General <math alttext=\"125\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>125</mn></math> Economy <math alttext=\"111\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>111</mn></math> Off-site <math alttext=\"44\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>44</mn></math> Total <math alttext=\"343\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>343</mn></math> Do the data in the table provide convincing statistical evidence that at least one of the proportions of all drivers who park in the airport’s parking lots who would choose each type of parking lot is different from the proportion of the total number of airport parking spaces accounted for by that type of parking lot? Complete the appropriate inference procedure to support your answer using a significance level of <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></math>.",
