    "description": "Snowshoe hares are small mammals that live in forests throughout Canada and the northern United States. Hares feed primarily on vegetation and are preyed on by lynx and owls.\nIn the fall, the hares shed their brown coat (molt), and a new white coat grows in over a period of <math alttext=\"40\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>40</mn></math> days. In the spring, the hares molt again and their white coat is replaced with a brown coat over a period of approximately <math alttext=\"30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>30</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>50</mn></math> days.\nIn a recent study, researchers observed that the majority of hares in an isolated population began the molting process during the same week in the fall, even though the ground was not snow covered. The majority of hares also began the molting process during the same week in the spring, even though the ground was still snow covered. The researchers formulated a hypothesis that the timing of the molting process is influenced by seasonal changes in the daylight period.",
    "question": "Several climate models for the original study area predict that the length of time the ground is covered in snow will decrease over time while the daylight periods will remain unchanged.\nAssuming that the researchers’ hypothesis about the timing of molting and the climate models are correct, which of the following will be the most likely immediate effect of the decrease in time the ground is snow covered on the hare population?",
