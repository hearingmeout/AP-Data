    "description": "Snowshoe hares are small mammals that live in forests throughout Canada and the northern United States. Hares feed primarily on vegetation and are preyed on by lynx and owls.\nIn the fall, the hares shed their brown coat (molt), and a new white coat grows in over a period of <math alttext=\"40\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>40</mn></math> days. In the spring, the hares molt again and their white coat is replaced with a brown coat over a period of approximately <math alttext=\"30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>30</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>50</mn></math> days.\nIn a recent study, researchers observed that the majority of hares in an isolated population began the molting process during the same week in the fall, even though the ground was not snow covered. The majority of hares also began the molting process during the same week in the spring, even though the ground was still snow covered. The researchers formulated a hypothesis that the timing of the molting process is influenced by seasonal changes in the daylight period.",
    "question": "A second isolated hare population has white coats all year, although the area is not covered by snow.\nWhich of the following is a testable question the researchers can ask to explain the origin of the different coat color of the second population?",
