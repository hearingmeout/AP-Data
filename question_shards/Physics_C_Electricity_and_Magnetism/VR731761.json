Half of the sage plants were exposed to light for <math alttext=\"60\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>60</mn></math> days, while the other half were exposed to light for <math alttext=\"75\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math> days. The rate of photosynthesis in each plant was then determined (Figure 1).\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the data?",
