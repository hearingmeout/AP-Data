    "description": "Mice live in territorial social groups, and each group has a single dominant male with the rest of the males in the group being subordinate. Male mice mark the area in which they live with their scent by leaving urine wherever they walk. There are two classes of proteins that are found in mouse urine, major urinary proteins (<math alttext=\"M U P s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MUPs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) and major histocompatibility complex (<math alttext=\"M H C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MHC</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) proteins. The proteins provide a unique scent for each mouse.\nIn an experiment, wild male mice were kept isolated in separate cages and their urination patterns were recorded. They were then combined into a single cage that was divided into two compartments by a mesh screen, and again their urination patterns were recorded (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Urination patterns recorded during an experiment",
