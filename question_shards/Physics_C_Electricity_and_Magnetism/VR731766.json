    "description": "Mice live in territorial social groups, and each group has a single dominant male with the rest of the males in the group being subordinate. Male mice mark the area in which they live with their scent by leaving urine wherever they walk. There are two classes of proteins that are found in mouse urine, major urinary proteins (<math alttext=\"M U P s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MUPs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) and major histocompatibility complex (<math alttext=\"M H C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MHC</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>) proteins. The proteins provide a unique scent for each mouse.\nIn an experiment, wild male mice were kept isolated in separate cages and their urination patterns were recorded. They were then combined into a single cage that was divided into two compartments by a mesh screen, and again their urination patterns were recorded (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Urination patterns recorded during an experiment",
    "question": "In addition to their role in urine scent marking, <math alttext=\"M H C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mtext>MHC</mtext></mstyle></math> proteins are used by body cells in both sexes of mice to distinguish self cells that originate in an individual’s body from nonself cells that do not originate in an individual’s body.\nWhich of the following best explains how <math alttext=\"M H C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MHC</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>-related odor-producing molecules might be used to maintain genetic diversity in mouse populations?",
