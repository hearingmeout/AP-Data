    "description": "Researchers investigated the effects of nonnative trout on the behavior of native salmon inhabiting a freshwater stream. Juvenile trout compete with juvenile salmon for resources, and adult trout prey on juvenile salmon.\n\nResearchers built enclosed channels in a freshwater stream. A transparent plastic mesh screen divided each channel into two sections, an upstream predator section and a downstream competitor section. Similar screens placed at the ends of each channel permitted the flow of water and small invertebrate organisms, eaten by juvenile members of both species of fish, through the channel. Juvenile salmon were placed in only the competitor section of each channel, in the absence or presence of juvenile trout, and in the absence or presence of adult trout placed only in the predator section (Figure 1). The researchers then recorded the percent of juvenile salmon that were active during the day and night, under the different conditions (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1. Experimental design of four freshwater stream channels used to monitor juvenile salmon behavior in the presence or absence of predator and/or competitor fish\n\nFigure 2.
