    "question": "<math alttext=\"D N A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>DNA</mi></math> damage can lead to the release of the protein cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c then activates the enzyme <math alttext=\"caspase 9\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>caspase-9</mtext></math>, resulting in the release of more cytochrome c, followed by apoptosis.\nWhich of the following best explains how the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is regulated by feedback?",

      {
