    "question": "The process of hydrogenation is used in the food industry to convert lipids that are liquids at room temperature into solids at room temperature. The process involves the chemical addition of hydrogen atoms to the fatty acid tails of lipids, breaking some or all of the carbon-carbon double bonds in the fatty acid tails.\nWhich of the following best explains why hydrogenation converts liquid lipids to solid lipids?",
