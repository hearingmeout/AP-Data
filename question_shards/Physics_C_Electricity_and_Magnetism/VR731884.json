    "question": "Figure 1. The path of insulin export from a cell\n\nInsulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate blood sugar levels. Figure 1 shows the path of insulin from its production in a cell to its export out of the cell.\n\nBased on Figure 1, which of the following best describes how insulin leaves the cell?",
