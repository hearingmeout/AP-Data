    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nEffie Waller Smith’s poem “The Recompense” was published in 1909.\n\nThe Recompense1reward\n O ancient ocean, with what courage stern\n Thy tides, since time began, have sought to gain\n The luring moon, toward which they rise in vain,\n Yet daily to their futile aim return.\n5Like thee do glorious human spirits yearn\n And strive and fail and strive and fail again\n Some starlike aspiration to attain,\n Some light that ever shall above them burn.\n\nYet truly shall their recompense abide\n10To all who strive, although unreached their goal:\n The ceaseless surgings of the ocean tide\n Do cleanse the mighty waters which they roll,\n And the high dreams in which it vainly sighed\n Make pure the deeps of the aspiring soul.",
