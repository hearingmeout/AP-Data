    "description": "Read the following poem carefully before you choose your answers.\n\nSimon Ortiz’ poem “Making Quiltwork” was published in 2002.\n\nMaking Quiltwork\n\nLike the coat of many colors,1In the Bible, the “coat of many colors” is a garment given to Joseph by his father Jacob as a sign of his favor. the letters, scraps,\n\nall those odds and bits we live by, we have come\n\nto know. Folks here live by the pretty quilts\n\nthey make, more than make actually, more than pretty.\n\n5They are histories, their lives and their quilts.\n\nIndian people who have been scattered, sundered\n\ninto odds and bits, determined to remake whole cloth.\n\nNothing quits. It changes many times, sometimes\n\nto something we don't want, but we again gather\n\n10the pieces, study them, decide, make decisions again,\n\nyes, and fit them to color, necessity, conditions,\n\ntaste and choice, and start again. Our lives are quilts,\n\nletters, odds and bits, scraps, but always the thread\n\nloving through them, the compassionate knowledge\n\n15that what we make is worth it and will outlast\n\nanything that was before and will be worthy\n\nof any people's art, endeavor, and final triumph.\n\nHere, look at my clothes, quilts, coats of many colors!\nFrom Out There Somewhere by Simon J.
