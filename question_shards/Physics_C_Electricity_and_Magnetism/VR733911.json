Outlines, bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored. Ruminants are hoofed animals, including cattle and sheep, that have a unique four-chambered stomach specialized to digest tough, fiber-filled grasses. Researchers studying ruminants are investigating the morphological and molecular characteristics of different ruminant families in order to determine the evolutionary relationships among the families. Cladograms of several ruminant families were constructed based on morphological data (Figure 1A) and molecular data (Figure 1B). Table 1 shows a sample of the morphological characteristics present in each family used to construct the cladogram in Figure 1A. Figure 1.
