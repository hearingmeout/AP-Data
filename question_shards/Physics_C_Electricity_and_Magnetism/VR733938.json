Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Wildlife biologists are interested in the health of tule elk, a species of deer found in California. An important measurement of tule elk health is their weight. The weight of a tule elk is difficult to measure in the wild. However, chest circumference, which is believed to be related to the weight of a tule elk, can easily be measured from a safe distance using a harmless laser. A study was done to investigate whether chest circumference, in centimeters (<math alttext=\"c m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>cm</mtext></math>), could be used to accurately estimate the weight, in kilograms (<math alttext=\"k g\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>kg</mtext></math>), of male tule elk. For the study, wildlife biologists captured <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>30</mn></math> male tule elk, measured their chest circumference and weight, and then released the elk. The data for the <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>30</mn></math> male tule elk are shown in the scatterplot. (a) Describe the relationship between chest circumference and weight of male tule elk in context.",
