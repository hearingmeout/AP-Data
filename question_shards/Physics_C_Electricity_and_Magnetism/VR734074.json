    "description": "In William Ellery Channing’s poem “The Barren Moors,” published in 1843, the speaker addresses moors, open expanses of wild, uncultivated land. Read the poem carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Channing uses literary elements and techniques to develop a complex portrayal of the speaker’s experience of this natural setting.\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nRespond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.\n\nSelect and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.\n\nExplain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.\n\nUse appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.\n\nThe Barren Moors\n\nOn your bare rocks, O barren moors,\n\nOn your bare rocks I love to lie,—\n\nThey stand like crags upon the shores,\n\nOr clouds upon a placid sky.\n\n5Across those spaces desolate,\n\nThe fox pursues his lonely way,\n\nThose solitudes can fairly sate1fully satisfy\n\nThe passage of my loneliest day.\n\nLike desert Islands far at sea\n\n10Where not a ship can ever land,\n\nThose dim uncertainties to me,\n\nFor something veritable stand.\n\nA serious place distinct from all\n\nWhich busy Life delights to feel,\n\n15I stand in this deserted hall,\n\nAnd thus the wounds of time conceal.\n\nNo friend’s cold eye, or sad delay,\n\nShall vex me now where not a sound\n\nFalls on the ear, and every day\n\n20Is soft as silence most profound.\n\nNo more upon these distant wolds2hills\n\nThe agitating world can come,\n\nA single pensive thought upholds\n\nThe arches of this dreamy home.\n\n25Within the sky above, one thought\n\nReplies to you, O barren moors!\n\nBetween, I stand, a creature taught\n\nTo stand between two silent floors.",
