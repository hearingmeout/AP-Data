    "question": "Two charged spheres on insulating stands are placed near each other, as shown in the figure. The net charge on each sphere is as indicated. Which of the following statements correctly describes both the electrostatic force that the spheres exert on each other and the net charge on each sphere?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The force is attractive. The net charge on each sphere corresponds to a small fraction of the number of electrons and protons in the sphere.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The force is attractive. The net charge on each sphere corresponds to a large fraction of the number of electrons and protons in the sphere.",
        "image": null
      },
