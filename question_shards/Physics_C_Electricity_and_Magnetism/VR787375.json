    "question": "A sphere and a cube are both centered on the same point charge, which has a charge <math alttext=\"positive uppercase Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math>. The cube has the same surface area as, but less volume than, the sphere. Which of the following claims about the electric flux through the sphere and the cube is correct, and what evidence or reasoning supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The flux is the same for both surfaces. The surfaces enclose the same amount of charge.",

      {
        "label": "The flux is the same for both surfaces. The surface area is the same for the sphere and the cube.",

      {
        "label": "The flux is greater for the sphere. The volume of the sphere is greater than that of the cube.",

        "label": "The flux is greater for the sphere. The electric field is everywhere normal to the sphere’s surface, but not to the cube’s surface.",
