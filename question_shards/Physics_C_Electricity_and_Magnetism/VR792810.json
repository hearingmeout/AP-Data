    "question": "A negatively charged particle moving in an electric field is initially at an electric potential of <math alttext=\"negative 10 volts\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn></mpadded><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mi></math> and moving in the positive <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math>-direction. A short time later, the particle is located at an electric potential of <math alttext=\"positive 10 volts\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mn>10</mn></mpadded><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mi></math> and still moving in the same direction. Which of the following statements describes the change in electrical potential energy of the particle-field system as the particle moves from a <math alttext=\"negative 10 volt\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn></mpadded><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mi></math> to a <math alttext=\"positive 10 volt\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mn>10</mn></mpadded><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</mi></math> potential, and provides evidence or reasoning that supports the claim?",
