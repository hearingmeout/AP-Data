    "question": "A thin, insulating spherical shell of radius <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math> has a positive charge <math alttext=\"uppercase Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>Q</mi></math> uniformly distributed on its surface. A small hole, which has a negligible effect on the shell’s electric field, is drilled in the shell’s surface, as shown in the figure. A particle of positive charge <math alttext=\"lowercase q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>q</mi></math> is then moved by an external force from an initial distance of <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math> from the surface, through the hole, to a final position at the center of the shell. Is the work <math alttext=\"W\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>W</mi></math> done by the external force on the particle positive or zero? What evidence or reasoning supports the claim?",
