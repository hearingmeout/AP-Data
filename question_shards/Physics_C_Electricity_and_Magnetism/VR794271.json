    "question": "A resistor is connected to a variable source of potential difference. A group of students take measurements of the potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></mstyle></math> across and current in a resistor for different settings of the source of potential difference. A graph of the students’ data is shown in the figure. Which of the following will best determine the resistance of the resistor?",
