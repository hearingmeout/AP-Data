    "question": "The figure shows a circuit consisting of a battery, a lightbulb, two resistors, and a switch. The switch is initially open. If the switch is then closed, does the current through the lightbulb change? What evidence or reasoning supports the claim?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, the current changes. The switch prevents charge from flowing in the circuit when it is open, but not when it is closed.",

      {
        "label": "Yes, the current changes. Closing the switch creates an additional closed electrical loop and the lightbulb is part of this loop.",

      {
        "label": "No, the current does not change. The lightbulb and the switch are not in series with one another.",

      {
        "label": "No, the current does not change. There is a closed electrical loop in the circuit regardless of whether the switch is open or closed.",

    "answer": "Yes, the current changes. Closing the switch creates an additional closed electrical loop and the lightbulb is part of this loop."
