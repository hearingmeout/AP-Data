    "description": "Several circuits are to be constructed, all as shown in the figure. The battery, ammeter, and voltmeter may or may not be considered to be ideal in each of the circuits.",
    "question": "Two more circuits are constructed according to the circuit diagram, both with ideal voltmeters, ideal ammeters, and identical resistors. One circuit has an ideal battery and the second circuit has a nonideal battery with the same <math alttext=\"e m f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>emf</mi></math> as the ideal battery. How does the nonideal battery affect the voltmeter reading, and what reasoning supports the claim?",
