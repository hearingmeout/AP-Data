    "question": "In the circuit shown, the switch is initially open and the capacitor is initially uncharged. Then the switch is closed. Which of the following correctly describes the current in Resistor <math alttext=\"R sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mtext>R</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></math> immediately after the switch is closed, and provides reasoning that supports the claim?",
