    "question": "Three small, charged spheres are initially all fixed in place at the relative positions indicated in the figure. The sphere on the left has a charge <math alttext=\"negative Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>-</mo><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math>, while the other two spheres each have a charge <math alttext=\"positive Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math>. The sphere on the right is then released from rest. Gravitational forces are negligible. Which of the following claims best describes the motion of the released sphere?",
