    "question": "Two identical, electrically neutral conducting spheres, Sphere <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> and Sphere <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>, are on insulating stands. Each sphere is connected to ground through a wire held in contact with the sphere by a student, as shown in the figure. A positively charged insulating rod is then brought close to each sphere. With the rods close to the spheres, the wire in contact with Sphere <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> is removed while the other wire remains in contact with Sphere <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. The rods are moved far away from the spheres, after which the wire in contact with Sphere <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> is removed as well. Which of the following correctly describes the final net charge, if any, on the two spheres?",
