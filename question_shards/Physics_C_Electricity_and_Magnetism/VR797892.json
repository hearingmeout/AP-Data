    "question": "Two small conducting spheres are identical but have been given different net charges. One sphere has a positive charge <math alttext=\"positive Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math>, the other sphere has a negative charge <math alttext=\"negative 2 Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math>. The spheres are on insulating stands that are initially a distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> from each other. The insulating stands are moved closer together so that the spheres briefly come into contact, and are then returned to their initial positions. Which of the following statements correctly compares the electric force between the two spheres before and after they are brought into contact?",
