    "question": "A positively charged glass rod is brought near but does not touch a metal sphere. A wire is then used to ground the sphere while the charged rod remains close to it. The grounding wire is disconnected and then the charged rod is moved away from the sphere. Which of the following describes the final net charge on the sphere and provides a correct explanation?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The net charge on the sphere is positive, because protons from ground move to the sphere through the wire to be closer to the positively charged rod.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The net charge on the sphere is positive, because electrons from the sphere move to ground through the wire to be farther away from the positively charged rod.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The net charge on the sphere is negative, because electrons from ground move to the sphere through the wire to be closer to the positively charged rod.",

    "answer": "The net charge on the sphere is negative, because electrons from ground move to the sphere through the wire to be closer to the positively charged rod."
