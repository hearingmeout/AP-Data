    "question": "A small insulating sphere of mass <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>m</mi></math> and charge <math alttext=\"positive q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mpadded></math> hangs from a string with negligible mass near the surface of Earth, as shown in the figure. A uniform electric field is directed horizontally, causing the sphere to hang with the string at an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> from the vertical. Suppose that a different sphere hangs from a string on the surface of the Moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is approximately <math alttext=\"one sixth\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></math> times that of Earth. Which of the following modifications could be made so that the sphere and string hang at the same angle on the Moon as on Earth?",
