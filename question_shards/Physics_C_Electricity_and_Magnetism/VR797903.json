    "question": "A small conducting sphere with a positive net charge <math alttext=\"positive Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math> is located within a spherical conducting shell that is electrically neutral. The figure shows a cross-sectional view of the small sphere and the shell, where the sphere is to the right of the center of the shell. Which of the following diagrams of electric field lines best represents the electric field inside the spherical shell?",
