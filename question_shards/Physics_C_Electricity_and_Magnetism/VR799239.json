    "description": "Four circuits are constructed, with each circuit having a battery of <math alttext=\"e m f\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>emf</mi> </math> <math alttext=\"script uppercase E\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>Ɛ</mi></math>, a switch, and three or four identical resistors of resistance <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>. The graph shows the battery current in one of the circuits as a function of time. Initially, the switch is open and the battery current is <math alttext=\"I sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mstyle></math>. The switch is then closed at time <math alttext=\"t sub S\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mtext>S</mtext></msub></math>, after which the battery current is <math alttext=\"3 I sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>.",
