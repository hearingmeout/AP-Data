    "description": "A ferromagnetic sample of metal is held in a strong external magnetic field created by a nearby magnet for a long time. The magnet is then moved far away from the sample.",
    "question": "Which of the following correctly describes the magnetization of the sample after the nearby magnet is removed, and explains why?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The sample is magnetized. The magnetic domains of the sample will become aligned with the external field and will remain in that alignment after the sample is removed from the external field.",

        "label": "The sample is magnetized. Free electrons in the sample will become polarized in the presence of the external field and will remain polarized after the sample is removed from the external field.",

        "label": "The sample is unmagnetized. The sample will have an equal number of magnetic dipoles aligned with the north and south poles of the nearby magnet.",
