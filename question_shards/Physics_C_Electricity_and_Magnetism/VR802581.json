    "question": "A charged particle is initially undergoing uniform circular motion in a region of space with a uniform magnetic field of strength <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>B</mi></math> perpendicular to the plane of the page. The value of <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>B</mi></math> undergoes a nearly instantaneous change to an increased magnitude (that is still uniform in space). The particle continues to move in the magnetic field that now has an increased magnitude. Which of the following correctly describes the effect of the increased magnetic field strength on the motion of the particle?",
