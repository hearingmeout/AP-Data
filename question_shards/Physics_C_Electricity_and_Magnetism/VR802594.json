    "description": "",
    "question": "Three long, parallel wires are placed in a horizontal plane and the direction of the current in each wire is as shown. The wire on the left carries current into the page, and the wires in the middle and on the right both carry current out of the page. The middle wire is equidistant from the other two wires. The direction of the current in the middle wire is then reversed. How does this affect the direction of the magnetic force exerted on the middle wire?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The direction of the force is unchanged because the external magnetic field at its location is unchanged.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The direction of the force is unchanged because it was initially zero and will remain zero since there is no net magnetic field at its location.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The direction of the force is reversed because the external magnetic field at its location is reversed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The direction of the force is reversed because the direction of the current is reversed while the direction of the external magnetic field has stayed the same.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The direction of the force is reversed because the direction of the current is reversed while the direction of the external magnetic field has stayed the same."
