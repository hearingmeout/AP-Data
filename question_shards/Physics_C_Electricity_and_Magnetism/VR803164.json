    "question": "A conducting object is initially uncharged and grounded, as shown in the figure. A particle with a charge <math alttext=\"positive Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi></mpadded></math> is then brought close to the conducting object. What is the sign of the net charge, if any, on the conducting object while the charged particle is close to it?",
