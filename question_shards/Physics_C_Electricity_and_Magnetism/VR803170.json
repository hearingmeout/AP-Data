    "question": "An isolated, charged, parallel-plate capacitor initially has air in the gap between its plates. A dielectric material is then inserted to fill the gap. When the dielectric is added to the capacitor, do the magnitude of the electric field between the plates and the electric potential energy stored in the capacitor become greater or less?\nMagnitude of Electric FieldElectric Potential EnergyAGreaterGreaterBGreaterLessCLessGreaterDLessLess",
