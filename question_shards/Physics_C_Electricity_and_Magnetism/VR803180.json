    "question": "An air-filled parallel-plate capacitor is connected to a battery. The space between the plates is then filled with a dielectric material, and the capacitor’s capacitance increases. Which of the following correctly explains how adding the dielectric increases the capacitance?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The polarization of the dielectric creates an electric field in the same direction as the field due to the capacitor plates. The superposition of the two fields is greater than the original plate field, so additional charge must move onto the plates. This increases the ratio of the plate charge to the potential difference.",

        "label": "The polarization of the dielectric creates an electric field in the same direction as the field due to the capacitor plates. The superposition of the two fields is the same as the original plate field, so some charge must be removed from the plates. This increases the ratio of the potential difference to the plate charge.",
