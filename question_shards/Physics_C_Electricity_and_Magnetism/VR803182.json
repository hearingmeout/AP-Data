    "description": "Also shown is a cylindrical Gaussian surface, which has its faces parallel to the disk faces. The surface is not drawn to scale, and the distance between the two end faces is small compared to the diameter of the cylinder. Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> is at the center of the face of the Gaussian surface that is just inside the metal disk, and Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math> is at the center of the face of the Gaussian surface that is just outside the disk, on the opposite side of the positive particle.",
