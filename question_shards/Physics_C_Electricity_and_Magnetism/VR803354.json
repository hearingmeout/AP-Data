    "question": "A small metal sphere with net charge <math alttext=\"negative 5 nanocoulombs\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>−</mo><mn>5</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>nC</mtext></mstyle></math> is located inside and concentric with a large metal shell that has a net charge of <math alttext=\"positive 9 nanocoulombs\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>+</mo><mn>9</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>nC</mtext></mstyle></math>, as shown in the cross-section diagram. Part of the net charge on the shell is found on its interior surface and part is found on its exterior surface. Which of the following explains why the interior surface of the shell has a different amount of charge than the exterior surface of the shell?",
