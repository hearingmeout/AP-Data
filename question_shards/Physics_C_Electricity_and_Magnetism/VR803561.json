    "question": "A capacitor is isolated from its environment, and within the capacitor there is an electric field of strength <math alttext=\"E\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>E</mi></math>. A dielectric material is then placed inside the capacitor, filling a portion of the space between the plates as shown. Within the dielectric material, an additional electric field is established. How does this new electric field compare to the original field <math alttext=\"E\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>E</mi></math>?",
