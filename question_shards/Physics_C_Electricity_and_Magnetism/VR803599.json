    "question": "At the moment shown, an electron is moving parallel to a current carrying wire with an initial velocity <math alttext=\"v sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> in the same direction as the current. Which of the following correctly describes the change, if any, to the magnitude of the electron’s acceleration <math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mi>a</mi></mstyle></math> as it moves in the region, and provides a correct justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "<math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>a</mi></math> decreases because the electron moves parallel to the magnetic field created by the current in the wire, resulting in work done on the electron by the magnetic field.",

      {
        "label": "<math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>a</mi></math> decreases because the electron is deflected away from the wire, resulting in a smaller force exerted on the electron by the magnetic field created by the current in the wire.",

      {
        "label": "<math alttext=\"a\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>a</mi></math> does not change because the magnetic field created by the current in the wire can only change the direction of the velocity of a moving charged particle, but not its magnitude.",
