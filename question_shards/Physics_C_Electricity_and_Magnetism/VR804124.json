The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and no values are indicated along it. The vertical axis is labeled “Charge,” and the value 0 is indicated. The curve intersects the horizontal axis at one fourth and three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis. The curve reaches maxima on the vertical axis and above the end of the horizontal axis. The curve reaches a minimum at a point halfway along the horizontal axis.",
