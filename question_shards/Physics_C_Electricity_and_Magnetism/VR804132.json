    "question": "The figure shows a battery connected to two resistors. Is there current in the resistors? What evidence or reasoning supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes. The two resistors form a closed electrical loop, which is required for charge to flow.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "Yes. The resistors are connected to the battery, which supplies charge that can flow to the resistors.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No. The two resistors form only one closed electrical loop, and at least two closed loops are required for charge to flow.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "No. The battery is not part of a closed electrical loop, and cannot supply a potential difference across either of the resistors.",
