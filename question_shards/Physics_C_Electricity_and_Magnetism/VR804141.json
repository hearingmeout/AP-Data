    "question": "A resistor made from an ohmic material is connected to a variable power supply. A group of students measures the current <math alttext=\"I\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>I</mi></math> and the potential difference <math alttext=\"delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></math> for the resistor over a range of power supply settings. The students calculate the ratio of the current to the potential difference, and then make a graph of the quantity <math alttext=\"the fraction with numerator I, and denominator delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"delta V\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mi>V</mi></math>. Which of the following graphs could be the students’ graph?",
