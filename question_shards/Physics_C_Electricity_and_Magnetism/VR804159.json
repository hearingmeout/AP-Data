    "question": "A group of students wish to determine the unknown resistance <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math> of a resistor. To do this, they have built the circuit shown in the figure. The students had to use a nonideal wire in one portion of the circuit, as indicated, but the remaining wires in the circuit are ideal, and the battery and two meters are ideal as well. The students then used the readings on the meters to calculate a value for the resistance. How does their calculated resistance value compare to the actual resistance <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>, and what evidence or reasoning helps support the claim?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The calculated value is equal to <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>. The voltmeter is in parallel with the resistor, and the ammeter can be treated as being in series with the resistor.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The calculated value is equal to <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>. An ideal battery has negligible internal resistance.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The calculated value is greater than <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>. Because of the nonideal wire, the circuit’s equivalent resistance is greater than <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>.",

      {
        "label": "The calculated value is greater than <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>. Because of the nonideal wire, the ammeter reading is less than the actual current through the resistor.",

    "answer": "The calculated value is equal to <math alttext=\"R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>R</mi></math>. The voltmeter is in parallel with the resistor, and the ammeter can be treated as being in series with the resistor."
