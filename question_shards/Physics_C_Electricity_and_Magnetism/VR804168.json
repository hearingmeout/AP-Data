    "question": "The figure shows a circuit made from a battery and three identical long, thin cylinders that are made from the same resistive material. Four labeled points, at the corners of the circuit, are also indicated. Which of the following graphs best represents the electric potential as a function of position along the circuit loop? Each graph starts at Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math> and traverses the circuit clockwise.",
