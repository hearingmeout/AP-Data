    "question": "A rectangular loop made of conducting wire is at rest. The left half of the loop is within a uniform magnetic field <math alttext=\"vector B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo>⇀</mo></mover></math> directed out of the page. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the rectangular loop. The right half of the loop is outside the field, as shown. A force <math alttext=\"vector F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>F</mi><mo>⇀</mo></mover></math> is applied to the rectangular loop such that the loop moves at a constant velocity to the right. Which of the following statements correctly relates the work done by the force <math alttext=\"vector F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>F</mi><mo>⇀</mo></mover></math> to remove the loop from the magnetic field and the speed of the loop?",
