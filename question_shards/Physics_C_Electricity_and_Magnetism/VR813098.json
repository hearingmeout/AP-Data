    "question": "The current in an inductor oscillates sinusoidally as a function of time. Which of the following is true about the energy stored in the magnetic field generated by the current in the inductor?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The energy stored is never zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The energy stored is zero at the same time the current in the inductor is zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The energy stored is zero only at the moment the circuit is connected.",

    "answer": "The energy stored is zero at the same time the current in the inductor is zero."
