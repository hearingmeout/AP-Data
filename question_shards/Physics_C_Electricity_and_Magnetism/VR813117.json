    "question": "A capacitor is connected to a battery for a long time. The capacitor is then disconnected from the battery and connected in series with an inductor. Which of the following is true about the current in the circuit and the energy stored in the inductor when the charge on the capacitor is zero?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The current is zero, and the energy stored in the inductor is zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The current is zero, and the energy stored in the inductor is maximum.",
