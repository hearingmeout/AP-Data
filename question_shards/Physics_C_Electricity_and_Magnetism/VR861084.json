    "question": "Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight. A variable capacitor consists of two semicircular, parallel plates of the same size, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. One plate is fixed in place, while the other plate can be rotated through various angular positions, resulting in a varying amount of overlapping plate area. The capacitance is determined by the amount of overlapping area and the distance between the plates. Also indicated in the figure is the angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> between the straight edges of the plates. The capacitor plates have been given equal-but-opposite amounts of charge, and a group of students wishes to experimentally determine the amount of charge on the plates. The students have an assortment of standard measurement equipment that includes a voltmeter probe, shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. The voltmeter probe can measure the potential difference between two conducting surfaces by touching one of the measurement tips to each conductor. Assume that using the voltmeter does not significantly affect the charge distribution or the amount of charge on the plates. Also assume the net charge on each plate resides uniformly only on the areas where they overlap. (a) Describe a procedure for collecting data that would allow the students to determine the charge on one of the capacitor plates by making a linear graph. In your description, include the measurements to be made along with the corresponding equipment needed for each measurement. Provide enough detail so that the experiment could be replicated, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty.",
