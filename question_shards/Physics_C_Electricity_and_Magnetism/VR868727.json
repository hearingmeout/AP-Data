    "question": "Direction Justification A The electric field is directed perpendicular to the equipotential lines and toward decreasing electric potential. B The electric field is in the same direction as the electric force exerted on a negatively charged object. C The electric field is directed perpendicular to the equipotential lines and toward increasing electric potential. D The electric field is in the same direction as the electric force exerted on a positively charged object.",
