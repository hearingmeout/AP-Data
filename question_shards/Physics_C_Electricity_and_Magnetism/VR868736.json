A paramagnetic material loses all its magnetic field strength when the magnet is removed. C Paramagnetic Ferromagnetic A paramagnetic material retains some of the strength of the magnetic field after the magnet is removed. A ferromagnetic material loses all its magnetic field strength when the magnet is removed. D Paramagnetic Paramagnetic Both materials become magnetized and drop some of the iron filings when the magnet is removed.",
