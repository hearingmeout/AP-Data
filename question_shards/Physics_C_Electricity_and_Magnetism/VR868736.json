When Nail <math alttext=\"X\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi> </math> is connected to a magnet, it can pick up iron filings, but drops roughly half of them when the magnet is removed. When Nail <math alttext=\"Y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math> is connected to a magnet, it also picks up iron filings, but it loses all of them when the magnet is removed.",
    "question": "Which of the following provides a correct description of the types of materials in these nails and provides valid reasoning?\n\nNail <math alttext=\"X\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math>\n Nail <math alttext=\"Y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math>\n Reason\n\nA\n Ferromagnetic\n Ferromagnetic\n Both materials become magnetized in the presence of a magnet.\n\nB\n Ferromagnetic\n Paramagnetic\n A ferromagnetic material retains some of the strength of the magnetic field after the magnet is removed. A paramagnetic material loses all its magnetic field strength when the magnet is removed.\n\nC\n Paramagnetic\n Ferromagnetic\n A paramagnetic material retains some of the strength of the magnetic field after the magnet is removed.
