The vertical axis is labeled phi, and the value B sub 0, end subscript, A, is indicated 2 units above the origin. The wave begins at the origin and moves upward and to the right to reach a peak at the point with coordinates the fraction pi over 2 omega comma B sub 0, end subscript, A. It crosses the horizontal axis at the fraction pi over omega. It reaches its trough 2 units below the horizontal axis at the fraction 3 pi over 2 omega. The wave ends on the horizontal axis 4 units to the right of the origin.",
