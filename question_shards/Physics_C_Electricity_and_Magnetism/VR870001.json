    "description": "Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight.\n\nA conducting bar of mass <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>m</mi> </math> is placed on two long conducting rails a distance <math alttext=\"l\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>ℓ</mo></math> apart. The rails are inclined at an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> with respect to the horizontal and the bar is able to slide on the rails with negligible friction between the bar and rails. The bar and rails are in a uniform and constant magnetic field of magnitude <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>B</mi></math> oriented perpendicular to the rails. A resistor of resistance <math alttext=\"R\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>R</mi> </math> connects the upper ends of the rails and completes the circuit, as shown. The bar is released from rest at the top of the incline.",
