    "question": "A student is given a diagram of equally spaced equipotential lines along with the values of the potentials for a region of space. Which of the following indicates whether it is possible for the student to create an electric field vector map in the same region of space and provides a valid justification?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "No, because electric field lines and equipotential lines are independent representations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the zero point for electric potential is not known it is not possible to uniquely determine the electric field.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the electric field is everywhere directed at a right angle to an isoline, with a magnitude that is inversely proportional to the spacing between adjacent isolines.",
