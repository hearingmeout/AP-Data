    "description": "Baker’s yeast, Saccharomycetes cerevisiae, is the species of yeast that is commonly used in baking, brewing, and making wine. It is a single-celled organism; each cell is capable of undergoing asexual reproduction by mitosis and sexual reproduction by meiosis, forming spores that combine with other spores.",
    "question": "To find out if energy and nutritional resource availability determines which form of reproduction is used, researchers grew twenty yeast colonies on an agar medium plate providing ideal nutrient environments. Each colony was composed of a population of yeast that originated from a single yeast cell that had reproduced asexually to form a population of millions of yeast clones. That plate was used to produce replicate plates of yeast colonies. Each replicate plate was a mirror image of the original cultures, so each colony could be subjected to each treatment group. The replicate plates contained different media as follows. Robust media: Contains all nutrients required by yeast in excess amounts Complete media: Contains all nutrients at a level promoting exponential growth at <math alttext=\"r sub max\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>max</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow></msub></mrow></math> Minimal media: Nutrients available at a low level, allowing growth, but stressing the yeast colonies Deficient media: Nutrient content less than what is needed to sustain growth, extreme stress on yeast colonies Eight replica plates were made, two plates of each media, and all plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. Yeast from each colony were observed through a microscope and their means of reproduction determined. Table 1 summarizes these results.
