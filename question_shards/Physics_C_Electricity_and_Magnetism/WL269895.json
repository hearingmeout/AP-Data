    "description": "A moth's color is controlled by two alleles, G and g, at a single locus. G (gray) is dominant to g (white). A large population of moths was studied, and the frequency of the G allele in the population over time was documented, as shown in the figure below. In 1980 a random sample of 2,000 pupae was collected and moths were allowed to emerge.",
    "question": "Which of the following is the most likely reason for the observed differences in the frequency of the G allele between 1965 and 1972?",
