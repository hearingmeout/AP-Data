    "description": "In an experiment, a researcher prepares a reaction mixture by dissolving a substance in a buffered solution. The substance is the substrate of a certain enzyme. The researcher adds a small amount of the enzyme to the reaction mixture and measures the amount of product that is formed over time. The data are represented in Figure 1.",
    "question": "Figure 1. The amount of product formed by an enzyme-catalyzed reaction over time Which of the following best predicts the immediate result of adding more substrate to the reaction mixture at the point indicated by the arrow in Figure 1?",
