    "question": "If an individual with diabetes consumes food that is high in simple carbohydrates, blood-sugar levels can rise above normal levels. Which of the following questions would provide the best direction for a researcher who wanted to study the impact of abnormally high blood-sugar levels on cellular homeostasis in diabetics?",
