    "question": "Phenotype Number Black, solid 47 Black, spotted 12 Gray, solid 16 Gray, spotted 4 Total 79 In a certain type of chicken, the allele for gray feathers is recessive to the allele for black feathers, and the allele for a spotted pattern is recessive to the allele for a solid pattern. Chickens that are heterozygous for both traits were crossed and the phenotypes for the offspring were recorded (Table 1). To determine whether the data are consistent with the expectations for independent assortment, students performed a chi-square analysis. Which of the following is the closest to the calculated chi-square value for the experiment?",
