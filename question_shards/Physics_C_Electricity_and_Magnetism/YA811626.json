    "description": "Hunting of African elephants for their tusks resulted in a <math alttext=\"90%\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>90%</mtext></math> reduction in the size of one particular elephant population by 1992. Since then, protections of elephant populations have improved, and the population size has begun to increase. Before 1992, tuskless elephants were rare, but now a significant proportion of the female elephants in this population are tuskless. An allele of the gene <math alttext=\"A M E L X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>A</mi><mi>M</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>L</mi><mi>X</mi></math> appears to be responsible for the tuskless trait.",
