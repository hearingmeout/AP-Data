    "question": "Directions: The suggested time for answering this question is about 22 minutes. Where calculations are required, clearly show how you arrived at your answer. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.On a field trip to two local ponds, a group of students observed a difference between the two ponds in the diversity of worms and insect larvae living in the mud and debris near the edges of the ponds. Numerous factors, both biotic and abiotic, influence the distribution of aquatic organisms.The students decided that they would investigate some of the abiotic factors. List three water-quality tests that could be conducted and explain what information each test provides. Include in your answers a description of the impact of each factor on the distribution of aquatic organisms.Larvae of a certain insect are found in pond A but not in pond B. Design a controlled experiment that would help explain the observed distribution of these insect larvae. Be sure to include the following in your design.Formulate a hypothesis.Identify the variable that will be manipulated.Outline the field and/or laboratory procedures that will be followed. Describe what data you will collect.Discuss the possible results and relate them to the distribution of the insect.What are indicator species and how are they used to assess environmental quality? Give a specific example of such a species and its use.",
