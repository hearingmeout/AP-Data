  "content": {
    "description": "While there is only one species of Galápagos Island tortoise, there are several subspecies. Larger islands with more wet highlands have lush vegetation near the ground. Tortoises there tend to have high-domed shells and shorter necks, which restrict upward head movement. They also have shorter limbs. They are the heaviest and largest of the subspecies.",
    "question": "Smaller, drier islands are inhabited by tortoises with longer necks and limbs and with shells that are elevated above the neck, which allow them to browse taller vegetation. Based on the information given, which of the following is a plausible explanation for the ancestry of the tortoise subspecies?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The subspecies share a recent common ancestor whose neck length, shell shape, and leg length were intermediate between the two subspecies.",

        "label": "The tortoises with shorter legs and necks were most easily preyed on as young animals by the rats that were introduced, so they survived only on a few islands.",
