    "question": "The two phylogenetic trees represent the relationship of whales to six other mammals. All of the organisms shown have a pulley-shaped astragalus bone in the ankle except for the whale. For each tree, describe a monophyletic group, the closest relative to the whale, and the point at which the pulley astragalus was lost or gained. Based on the principle of parsimony (the simplest explanation is the best) and the genomic information in the table shown, identify which tree is the best representation of the evolutionary relationship of these animals, and justify your answer.",
