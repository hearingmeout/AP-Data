A conservation group is looking for renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric energy that could be used to generate electricity in grassland ecosystems, such as in the midwestern United States or in a savanna in Africa.(i) Propose a different renewable resource to use that would be a realistic solution to generating electricity without using fossil fuels or hydroelectric power in a grassland ecosystem.(ii) Justify the solution proposed in (b)(i) by explaining a potential advantage of using a different renewable resource to generate electricity.",
