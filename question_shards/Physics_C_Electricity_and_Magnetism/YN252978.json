    "question": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a diploid yeast species that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. An experiment was performed to induce mitotically dividing S. cerevisiae cells in <math alttext=\"G 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>G</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> to undergo meiosis. Which of the following best describes the steps these cells will follow to form gametes?",
