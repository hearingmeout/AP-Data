    "description": "A cell signaling pathway begins when a hormone binds to its receptor. After binding, relay molecules within the cell become activated and trigger cellular responses. When drug K is added to cells, the cellular response is heightened and prolonged.",
    "question": "Which of the following mechanisms best explains how drug K increases the cellular response?",
