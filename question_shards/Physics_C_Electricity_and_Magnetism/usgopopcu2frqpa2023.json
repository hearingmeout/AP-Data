    "description": "In an address to the nation, the president proposed expanding the federal government’s role in early childhood education by making “high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.”\n\nThe proposal outlined a plan that would give federal matching dollars to states that provide preschool funding to families earning up to 200 percent of the poverty level. The plan would also expand federal funding for toddler and infant care for working families.\n\nThis proposal was designed to build on the successes of state programs that expanded government funding for early childhood education in states such as Alabama, which had recently approved a $12.5 million increase in its early childhood program.",
