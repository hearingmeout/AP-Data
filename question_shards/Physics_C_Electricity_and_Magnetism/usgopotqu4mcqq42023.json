    "description": "Parents have the greatest stake in the outcome of their child’s education. Accordingly, they should also have the power to make sure their child is getting the right education.\n\nAs Deven Carlson points out, there is little constituency in America for the top-down reforms that have been tried time and again. In order for any reform to truly work, it must attract and maintain the support of the people.\n\nI have seen such support for parental empowerment. The more parents exercise it, the more they like it. This growing support is why states are responding to that demand one by one. . . .\n\nEqual access to a quality education should be a right for every American and every parent should have the right to choose how their child is educated. Government exists to protect those rights, not usurp them.\n\nSo let’s face it: the opponents of [school choice] could repeal every voucher law, close every charter school, and defund every choice program across the country. But school choice still wouldn’t go away. There would still be school choice . . .  for the affluent and the powerful.\n\nLet’s empower the forgotten parents to decide where their children go to school. Let’s show some humility and trust all parents to know their kids’ needs better than we do.\n\nBetsy DeVos, Secretary of Education, January 16, 2018",
