    "question": "Three identical disks are initially at rest on a frictionless, horizontal table with their edges touching to form a triangle, as shown in the top view above. An explosion occurs within the triangle, propelling the disks horizontally along the surface. Which of the following diagrams shows a possible position of the disks at a later time? (In these diagrams, the triangle is shown in its original position.)",
