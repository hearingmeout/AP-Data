    "question": "Car A can travel around a curved section of road without skidding at a maximum constant speed of 10 m/s. When car B travels around the same curve without skidding at its maximum speed, it has twice the centripetal acceleration as car A. The maximum speed at which car B can safely travel around the curve is most nearly",
