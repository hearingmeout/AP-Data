    "question": "A student is pulling a cart full of water horizontally on flat ground at a constant velocity. The cart has a small hole through which the water slowly leaks out of the cart. For the system consisting of the cart and the water within the cart, how is the magnitude of the momentum of the system changing, if at all?",

        "label": "The magnitude of the momentum is increasing.",
