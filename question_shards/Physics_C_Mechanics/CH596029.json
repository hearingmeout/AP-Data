    "question": "A meterstick of negligible mass is placed on a fulcrum at the 0.4 m mark, with a 1 kg mass hung at the zero mark and a 0.5 kg mass hung at the 1.0 m mark. The meterstick is held horizontal and released. Immediately after release, the magnitude of the net torque on the meterstick about the fulcrum is most nearly",
