    "question": "Two coins are located on a large rotating disk that is spinning counterclockwise about an axis through its center, as shown in the figure. One coin is near the edge of the disk and the other coin is located closer to the large disk’s center. The coins do not slip on the disk. Which of the following statements about the linear and angular speeds of the two coins is true?",
