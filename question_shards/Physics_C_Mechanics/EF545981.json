The bar has a nonuniform mass density, and the center of mass is located a known distance x from the end with the pivot. You are to determine the rotational inertia Ib of the bar about the pivot by suspending the bar from the pivot, as shown above, and allowing it to swing. Express all algebraic answers in terms of Ib, the given quantities, and fundamental constants. By applying the appropriate equation of motion to the bar, write the differential equation for the angle θ the bar makes with the vertical. By applying the small-angle approximation to your differential equation, calculate the period of the bar’s motion. Describe the experimental procedure you would use to make the additional measurements needed to determine Ib. Include how you would use your measurements to obtain Ib and how you would minimize experimental error. Now suppose that you were not given the location of the center of mass of the bar. Describe an experimental procedure that you could use to determine it, including the equipment that you would need.",
