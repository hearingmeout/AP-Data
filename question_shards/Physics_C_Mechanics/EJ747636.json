    "question": "A car of mass m, initially at rest at time t = 0, is driven to the right, as shown above, along a straight, horizontal road with the engine causing a constant force F0 to be applied. While moving, the car encounters a resistance force equal to –kv, where v is the velocity of the car and k is a positive constant. The dot below represents the center of mass of the car. On this figure, draw and label vectors to represent all the forces acting on the car as it moves with a velocity v to the right. Determine the horizontal acceleration of the car in terms of k, v, F0, and m. Derive the equation expressing the velocity of the car as a function of time t in terms of k, F0, and m. On the axes below, sketch a graph of the car's velocity v as a function of time t. Label important values on the vertical axis. On the axes below, sketch a graph of the car's acceleration a as a function of time t. Label important values on the vertical axis.",
