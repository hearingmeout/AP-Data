    "question": "Two blocks are joined by a light string that passes over the pulley shown above, which has radius R and moment of inertia I about its center. T1 and T2 are the tensions in the string on either side of the pulley and 𝛂 is the angular acceleration of the pulley. Which of the following equations best describes the pulley's rotational motion during the time the blocks accelerate?",
