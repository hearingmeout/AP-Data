    "question": "A person is standing at one end of a uniform raft of length L that is floating motionless on water, as shown above. The center of mass of the person-raft system is a distance d from the center of the raft. The person then walks to the other end of the raft. If friction between the raft and the water is negligible, how far does the raft move relative to the water?",
