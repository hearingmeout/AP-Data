    "question": "A car is traveling along a straight, level road when it runs out of gas at time t = 0. From this time on, the net force on the car is a resistive force of –kv, where v is velocity and k is a constant. Which of the following pairs of graphs best represents the speed v and position x of the car as functions of time after t = 0 ?",

Each choice has a graph on the left with velocity on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, and a graph on the right with position on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.
