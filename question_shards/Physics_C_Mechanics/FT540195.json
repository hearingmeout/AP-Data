    "question": "A 3.0 kg object is moving along the x-axis in a region where its potential energy as a function of x is given as U(x) = 4.0x2 , where U is in joules and x is in meters. When the object passes the point x = -0.50 m, its velocity is +2.0 m/s. All forces acting on the object are conservative.\n\nCalculate the total mechanical energy of the object\n\nCalculate the x-coordinate of any points at which the object has zero kinetic energy.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the momentum of the object at x = 0.60 m.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the acceleration of the object as it passes x = 0.60 m.\n\nOn the axes below, sketch graphs of the object’s position x versus time t and kinetic energy K versus time t. Assume that x = 0 at time t = 0 . The two graphs should cover the same time interval and use the same scale on the horizontal axes.",
