    "question": "The force F exerted on a ball during a collision with a wall is given as a function of time t by the equation F(t) = αt - βt 2 , where α = 400 N/s and β = 4000 N/s 2 . The ball first contacts the wall at t = 0, and the collision lasts for 0.10 s. What is the magnitude of the change in momentum of the ball?",
