    "question": "A wheel of radius R is fixed to an axle of radius R/3 and rotates at constant angular speed ω , as shown in the figure above. A force of magnitude F1 is applied tangent to the outer edge of the wheel. A second force of magnitude F2 is applied tangent to the edge of the axle to keep the wheel rotating at constant angular speed ω. The magnitude F2 is equal to",
