    "question": "A horizontal uniform plank is supported by ropes I and II at points P and Q, respectively, as shown above. The two ropes have negligible mass. The tension in rope I is 150 N. The point at which rope II is attached to the plank is now moved to point R halfway between point Q and point C, the center of the plank. The plank remains horizontal. Which of the following are most nearly the new tensions in the two ropes?",
