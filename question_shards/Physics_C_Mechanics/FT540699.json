    "question": "The potential energy U as a function of the position x of an object is given by U (x) = - 400/x, where U is in joules and x is in meters. The object is released from rest at position x = 30 m and is free to move along the x-axis. When the object has moved a distance of 10 m from its initial position, the magnitude of the force associated with this potential energy function is",
