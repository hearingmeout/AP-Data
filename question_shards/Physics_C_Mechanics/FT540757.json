    "question": "Identical blocks 1 and 2 start from rest at height h and travel down two differently shaped tracks onto identical rough horizontal surfaces, as shown in the figures above. Both tracks are frictionless, and both blocks make a smooth transition onto the rough horizontal surfaces. Block 1 comes to rest at a horizontal distance d1 from the bottom of the track. Which of the following best describes and explains the horizontal distance d2 that block 2 travels before coming to rest?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "d2 < d1, because block 2 reaches its maximum speed later than block 1",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "d2 < d1, because block 2 has a lower maximum speed later than block 1",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "d2 = d1, because the blocks have the same mass",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "d2 = d1, because the blocks start at the same height",

      },
      {
        "label": "d2 > d1, because the track for block 2 is shorter",
