    "question": "Two 0.60-kilogram objects are connected by a thread that passes over a light, frictionless pulley, as shown above. The objects are initially held at rest. If a third object with a mass of 0.30 kilogram is added on top of one of the 0.60-kilogram objects as shown and the objects are released, the magnitude of the acceleration of the 0.30-kilogram object is most nearly",
