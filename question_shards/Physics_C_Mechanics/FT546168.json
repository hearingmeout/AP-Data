    "description": "An ant of mass m clings to the rim of a flywheel of radius r, as shown above. The flywheel rotates clockwise on a horizontal shaft S with constant angular velocity 𝜔 . As the wheel rotates, the ant revolves past the stationary points I, II, III, and IV. The ant can adhere to the wheel with a force much greater than its own weight.",
    "question": "It will be most difficult for the ant to adhere to the wheel as it revolves past which of the four points?",
