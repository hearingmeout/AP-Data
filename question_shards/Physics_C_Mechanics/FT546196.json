    "question": "A block of mass 5 kilograms lies on an inclined plane, as shown above. The horizontal and vertical supports for the plane have lengths of 4 meters and 3 meters, respectively. The coefficient of friction between the plane and the block is 0.3. The magnitude of the force F necessary to pull the block up the plane with constant speed is most nearly",
