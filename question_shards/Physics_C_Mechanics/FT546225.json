    "description": "A spring has a force constant of 100 N/m and an unstretched length of 0.07 m. One end is attached to a post that is free to rotate in the center of a smooth table, as shown in the top view above. The other end is attached to a 1 kg disc moving in uniform circular motion on the table, which stretches the spring by 0.03 m. Friction is negligible.",
    "question": "What is the centripetal force on the disc?",
