    "question": "A figure of a dancer on a music box moves counterclockwise at constant speed around the path shown above. The path is such that the lengths of its segments, PQ, QR, RS, and SP, are equal. Arcs QR and SP are semicircles. Which of the following best represents the magnitude of the dancer's acceleration as a function of time t during one trip around the path, beginning at point P ?",
