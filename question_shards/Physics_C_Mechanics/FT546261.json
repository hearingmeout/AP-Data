    "question": "Three blocks of masses 3m, 2m, and m are connected to strings A, B, and C as shown above. The blocks are pulled along a rough surface by a force of magnitude F exerted by string C. The coefficient of friction between each block and the surface is the same. Which string must be the strongest in order not to break?",
