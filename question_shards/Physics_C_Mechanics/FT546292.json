    "question": "As shown above, two students sit at opposite ends of a boat that is initially at rest. The student in the front throws a heavy ball to the student in the back. What is the motion of the boat at the time immediately after the ball is thrown and, later, after the ball is caught? (Assume that air and water friction are negligible.)",
