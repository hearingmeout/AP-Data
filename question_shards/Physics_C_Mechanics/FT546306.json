    "question": "Two projectiles are launched with the same initial speed from the same location, one at a 30° angle and the other at a 60° angle with the horizontal. They land at the same height at which they were launched. If air resistance is negligible, how do the projectiles’ respective maximum heights, H30 and H60 , and times in the air, T30 and T60 , compare with each other?",
