    "question": "An object of mass 100 kg is initially at rest on a horizontal frictionless surface. At time t = 0, a horizontal force of 10 N is applied to the object for 1 s and then removed. Which of the following is true of the object at time t = 2 s if it is still on the surface?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "It is at the same position it had at t = 0, since a force of 10 N is not large enough to move such a massive object.",

        "label": "It is moving with constant nonzero acceleration.",
