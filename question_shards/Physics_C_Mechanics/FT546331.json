    "description": "In the system of two blocks and a spring shown above, blocks 1 and 2 are connected by a string that passes over a pulley. The initially unstretched spring connects block 1 to a rigid wall. Block 1 is released from rest, initially slides to the right, and is eventually brought to rest by the spring and by friction on the horizontal surface.",
    "question": "After block 1 comes to rest, the force exerted on it by the spring must be equal in magnitude to",
