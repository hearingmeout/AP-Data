    "description": "A ball is struck at time t = 0 and follows the parabolic path shown in the diagram above. The following graphs show quantities possibly associated with the motion as a function of time t. Assume that air resistance is negligible and that the positive directions are upward and to the right.",
    "question": "Which graph represents the horizontal component of the velocity of the ball?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Choice A is a graph in the first quadrant with t on the horizontal axis. Choice A shows a line that starts at the origin increasing linearly, then halfway along the horizontal axis becomes linearly decreasing, returning to the horizontal axis.",

        "label": "Choice B is a graph in the first quadrant with t on the horizontal axis. Choice B shows a line that starts on the vertical axis above the origin decreasing linearly, reaches the horizontal axis, and then becomes linearly increasing.",
