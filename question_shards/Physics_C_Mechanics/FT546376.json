    "question": "Two blocks of masses m1 and m2 are connected by a massless string that passes over a wheel of mass m, as shown above. The string does not slip on the wheel and exerts forces T1 and T2 on the blocks. When the wheel is released from rest in the position shown, it undergoes an angular acceleration and rotates clockwise. Which of the following statements about T1 and T2 is correct?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "T1 = T2 because the wheel has mass.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T1 = T2 because both blocks have the same acceleration.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T1 > T2 because m1 is farther from the wheel than m2.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T1 > T2 because m1 accelerates upward.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "T2 > T1 because an unbalanced clockwise torque is needed to accelerate the wheel clockwise.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "T2 > T1 because an unbalanced clockwise torque is needed to accelerate the wheel clockwise."
