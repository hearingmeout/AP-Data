    "description": "An unstretched ideal spring hangs vertically from a fixed support. A 0.4 kg object is then attached to the lower end of the spring. The object is pulled down to a distance of 0.35 m below the unstretched position and released from rest at time t = 0 . A graph of the subsequent vertical position y of the lower end of the spring as a function of t is given above, where y = 0 when the spring was initially unstretched.",
