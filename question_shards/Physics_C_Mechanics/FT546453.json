    "question": "Persons X, Y, and Z walk along a circular path of radius 50 m. Person X walks halfway around the path, Person Y walks 3/4 of the way around the path, and Person Z walks completely around the path. Which of the following correctly lists the walkers in order of the magnitudes of their displacement vectors from the least to the greatest?",
