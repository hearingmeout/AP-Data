    "question": "Object X of mass m is moving to the right with a speed of 3 m/s when it collides with object Y of mass m that is moving to the right with a speed of 2 m/s, as shown above. After the collision, X is moving to the right with a speed of 2 m/s and Y is moving to the right with a speed of 3 m/s. Which of the following is true of the collision?",
