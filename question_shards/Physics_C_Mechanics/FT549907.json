    "question": "A long, uniform rod of mass M and length ℓ is supported at the left end by a horizontal axis into the page and perpendicular to the rod, as shown above. The right end is connected to the ceiling by a thin vertical thread so that the rod is horizontal. The moment of inertia of the rod about the axis at the end of the rod is Mℓ2/3. Express the answers to all parts of this question in terms of M, ℓ , and g.\n\na. Determine the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on the rod by the axis.\n\nThe thread is then burned by a match. For the time immediately after the thread breaks, determine each of the following.\n\nb. The angular acceleration of the rod about the axis\n\nc. The translational acceleration of the center of mass of the rod\n\nd. The force exerted on the end of the rod by the axis\n\nThe rod rotates about the axis and swings down from the horizontal position.\n\ne. Determine the angular velocity of the rod as a function of 0, the arbitrary angle through which the rod has swung.",
