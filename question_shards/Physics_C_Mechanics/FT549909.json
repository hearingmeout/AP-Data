    "question": "Two gliders move freely on an air track with negligible friction, as shown above. Glider A has a mass of 0.90 kg and glider B has a mass of 0.60 kg. Initially, glider A moves toward glider B, which is at rest. A spring of negligible mass is attached to the right side of glider A. Strobe photography is used to record successive positions of glider A at 0.10 s intervals over a total time of 2.00 s, during which time it collides with glider B.\n\nThe following diagram represents the data for the motion of glider A. Positions of glider A at the end of each 0.10 s interval are indicated by the symbol ^ against a metric ruler. The total elapsed time t after each 0.50 s is also indicated.\n\na. Determine the average speed of glider A for the following time intervals.\n\n0.10 s to 0.30 s\n\n0.90 s to 1.10 s\n\n1.70 s to 1.90 s\n\nb. On the axes below, sketch a graph, consistent with the data above, of the speed of glider A as a function of time t for the 2.00 s interval.\n\nc.\n\nUse the data to calculate the speed of glider B immediately after it separates from the spring.\n\nOn the axes below, sketch a graph of the speed of glider B as a function of time t.\n\nA graph of the total kinetic energy K for the two-glider system over the 2.00 s interval has the following shape. K0 is the total kinetic energy of the system at time t = 0.\n\nd.\n\nIs the collision elastic? Justify your answer.\n\nBriefly explain why there is a minimum in the kinetic energy curve at t = 1.00 s.",
