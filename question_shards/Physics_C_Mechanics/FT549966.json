    "question": "A space shuttle astronaut in a circular orbit around the Earth has an assembly consisting of two small dense spheres, each of mass m, whose centers are connected by a rigid rod of length ℓ and negligible mass. The astronaut also has a device that will launch a small lump of clay of mass m at speed v0, Express your answers in terms of m, v0, ℓ , and fundamental constants.\n\na. Initially, the assembly is \"floating\" freely at rest relative to the cabin, and the astronaut launches the clay lump so that it perpendicularly strikes and sticks to the midpoint of the rod, as shown above.\n\nDetermine the total kinetic energy of the system (assembly and clay lump) after the collision.\n\nDetermine the change in kinetic energy as a result of the collision.\n\nb. The assembly is brought to rest, the clay lump removed, and the experiment is repeated as shown above, with the clay lump striking perpendicular to the rod but this time sticking to one of the spheres of the assembly.\n\nDetermine the distance from the left end of the rod to the center of mass of the system (assembly and clay lump) immediately after the collision. (Assume that the radii of the spheres and clay lump are much smaller than the separation of the spheres.)\n\nOn the figure above, indicate the direction of the motion of the center of mass immediately after the collision.\n\nDetermine the speed of the center of mass immediately after the collision.\n\nDetermine the angular speed of the system (assembly and clay lump) immediately after the collision.\n\nDetermine the change in kinetic energy as a result of the collision.",
