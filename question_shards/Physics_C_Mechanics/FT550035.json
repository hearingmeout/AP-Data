    "question": "A ball of mass m and cross-sectional area A is released from rest near the surface of Earth. The ball experiences a resistive force due to the air that is proportional to the ball’s velocity, Fr = –bAv, where b is a positive constant. Determine all algebraic answers in terms of m, b, A, and fundamental constants. Draw free-body diagrams for the ball for the following situations. Give each vector a descriptive label and draw them approximately to scale. Calculate the terminal velocity vT of the ball. Starting from Newton’s laws, derive an expression for the time required for the ball to reach one third the terminal velocity. Sketch the following two graphs of the ball’s motion from when the ball is released at time t = 0 until it approaches terminal velocity.",
