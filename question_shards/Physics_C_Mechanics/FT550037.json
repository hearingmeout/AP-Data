    "question": "Suggested time: 15 minutes\nA 0.30 kg cart moving at 2.0 m/s to the right collides with a 0.10 kg cart, initially moving at 3.0 m/s to the left. After the collision, the 0.10 kg cart moves to the right with a speed of 1.2 m/s. Assume friction is negligible. \n\nCalculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the 0.30 kg cart after the collision.\n\nIs this an elastic collision? Justify your answer.\nThe 0.30 kg cart is now removed. The 0.10 kg cart continues to move to the right and then collides with and compresses an ideal spring whose right end is attached to a fixed wall.\n\nCalculate the potential energy of the spring when it reaches maximum compression.\n\nThe maximum compression of the spring is 0.10 m. Calculate the spring constant of the spring. \n\nSuppose instead that the spring is nonlinear such that the force F due to the spring when it is compressed a distance x is F = –bx3 . Calculate the value of the constant b if the spring is compressed 0.10 m.",
