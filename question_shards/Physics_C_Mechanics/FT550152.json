    "question": "A motion sensor and a force sensor record the motion of a cart along a track, as shown above. The cart is given a push so that it moves toward the force sensor and then collides with it. The two sensors record the values shown in the following graphs.\n\nDetermine the cart’s average acceleration between t = 0.33 s and t = 0.37 s.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the change in the cart’s momentum during the collision.\n\nDetermine the mass of the cart.\n\nDetermine the energy lost in the collision between the force sensor and the cart.",
