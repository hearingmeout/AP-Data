    "question": "The 100 kg box shown above is being pulled along the x-axis by a student. The box slides across a rough surface, and its position x varies with time t according to the equation x = 0.5t3 + 2t , where x is in meters and t is in seconds.\n\nDetermine the speed of the box at time t = 0.\n\nDetermine the following as functions of time t.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the box\n\nThe net force acting on the box\n\nThe power being delivered to the box\n\nCalculate the net work done on the box in the interval t = 0 to t = 2 s.\n\nIndicate below whether the work done on the box by the student in the interval t = 0 to t = 2 s would be greater than, less than, or equal to the answer in part c.\n\n_____ Greater than              _____ Less than             _____ Equal to\n\nJustify your answer.",
