    "question": "A ball of mass M is thrown vertically upward with an initial speed of v0 . It experiences a force of air resistance given by F = –kv , where k is a positive constant. The positive direction for all vector quantities is upward. Express all algebraic answers in terms of M, k, v0 , and fundamental constants.\n\nDoes the magnitude of the acceleration of the ball increase, decrease, or remain the same as the ball moves upward?\n\n____ increases ____ decreases ____ remains the same\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nWrite, but do NOT solve, a differential equation for the instantaneous speed v of the ball in terms of time t as the ball moves upward.\n\nDetermine the terminal speed of the ball as it moves downward.\n\nDoes it take longer for the ball to rise to its maximum height or to fall from its maximum height back to the height from which it was thrown?\n\n____longer to rise ____longer to fall\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nOn the axes below, sketch a graph of velocity versus time for the upward and downward parts of the ball’s flight, where tƒ is the time at which the ball returns to the height from which it was thrown.",
