    "question": "A student is given the set of orbital data for some of the moons of Saturn shown below and is asked to use the data to determine the mass MS of Saturn. Assume the orbits of these moons are circular.\n\nWrite an algebraic expression for the gravitational force between Saturn and one of its moons.\n\nUse your expression from part a. and the assumption of circular orbits to derive an equation for the orbital period T of a moon as a function of its orbital radius R.\n\nWhich quantities should be graphed to yield a straight line whose slope could be used to determine Saturn’s mass?\n\nComplete the data table by calculating the two quantities to be graphed. Label the top of each column, including units.\n\nPlot the graph on the axes below. Label the axes with the variables used and appropriate numbers to indicate the scale.\n\nUsing the graph, calculate a value for the mass of Saturn.",
