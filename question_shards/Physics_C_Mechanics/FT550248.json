    "question": "An amusement park ride features a passenger compartment of mass M that is released from rest at point A, as shown in the figure above, and moves along a track to point E. The compartment is in free fall between points A and B, which are a distance of 3R/4 apart, then moves along the circular arc of radius R between points B and D.\n\nAssume the track is frictionless from point A to point D and the dimensions of the passenger compartment are negligible compared to R.\n\nOn the dot below that represents the passenger compartment, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the passenger compartment when it is at point C, which is at an angle θ from point B.\n\nIn terms of θ and the magnitudes of the forces drawn in part a., determine an expression for the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the compartment at point C. If you need to draw anything besides what you have shown in part a. to assist in your solution, use the space below. Do NOT add anything to the figure in part a.\n\nDerive an expression for the speed vD of the passenger compartment as it reaches point D in terms of M, R, and fundamental constants, as appropriate.\n\nA force acts on the compartment between points D and E and brings it to rest at point E.\n\nIf the compartment is brought to rest by friction, calculate the numerical value of the coefficient of friction µ between the compartment and the track.\n\nNow consider the case in which there is no friction between the compartment and the track, but instead the compartment is brought to rest by a braking force –kv , where k is a constant and v is the velocity of the compartment. Express all algebraic answers to the following in terms of M, R, k, vD , and fundamental constants, as appropriate.\n\nWrite, but do NOT solve, the differential equation for v(t) .\n\nSolve the differential equation you wrote in part i.\n\nOn the axes below, sketch a graph of the magnitude of the acceleration of the compartment as a function of time. On the axes, explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values or algebraic expressions, as appropriate.",
