    "question": "Experiment 1. A block of mass 0.30 kg is placed on a frictionless table and is attached to one end of a horizontal spring of spring constant k, as shown above. The other end of the spring is attached to a fixed wall. The block is set into oscillatory motion by stretching the spring and releasing the block from rest at time t = 0. A motion detector is used to record the position of the block as it oscillates. The resulting graph of velocity v versus time t is shown below. The positive direction for all quantities is to the right.\n\na. Determine the equation for v(t) , including numerical values for all constants.\n\nb. Given that the equilibrium position is at x = 0 , determine the equation for x(t), including numerical values for all constants.\n\nc. Calculate the value of k.\n\nExperiment 2. The block and spring arrangement is now placed on a rough surface, as shown below. The block is displaced so that the spring is compressed a distance d and released from rest.\n\nd. On the dots below that represent the block, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the block when the spring is compressed a distance x = d / 2 and the block is moving in the direction indicated below each dot.\n\ne. Draw a sketch of v versus t in this case. Assume that there is a negligible change in the period and that the positive direction is still to the right.",
