    "question": "You are to perform an experiment investigating the conservation of mechanical energy involving a transformation from initial gravitational potential energy to translational kinetic energy. You are given the equipment listed below, all the supports required to hold the equipment, and a lab table. On the list below, indicate each piece of equipment you would use by checking the line next to each item. Outline a procedure for performing the experiment. Include a diagram of your experimental setup. Label the equipment in your diagram. Also include a description of the measurements you would make and a symbol for each measurement. Give a detailed account of the calculations of gravitational potential energy and translational kinetic energy both before and after the transformation, in terms of the quantities measured in part b. After your first trial, your calculations show that the energy increased during the experiment. Assuming you made no mathematical errors, give a reasonable explanation for this result. On all other trials, your calculations show that the energy decreased during the experiment. Assuming you made no mathematical errors, give a reasonable physical explanation for the fact that the average energy you determined decreased. Include references to conservative and nonconservative forces, as appropriate.",
