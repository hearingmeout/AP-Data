    "question": "A ring of mass M, radius R, and rotational inertia MR2 is initially sliding on a frictionless surface at constant velocity v0 to the right, as shown above. At time t = 0 it encounters a surface with coefficient of friction µ and begins sliding and rotating. After traveling a distance L, the ring begins rolling without sliding. Express all answers to the following in terms of M, R, v0, µ, and fundamental constants, as appropriate. Starting from Newton’s second law in either translational or rotational form, as appropriate, derive a differential equation that can be used to solve for the magnitude of the following as the ring is sliding and rotating. The linear velocity v of the ring as a function of time t The angular velocity 𝜔 of the ring as a function of time t Derive an expression for the magnitude of the following as the ring is sliding and rotating. The linear velocity v of the ring as a function of time t The angular velocity 𝜔 of the ring as a function of time t Derive an expression for the time it takes the ring to travel the distance L. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the velocity of the ring immediately after it has traveled the distance L. Derive an expression for the distance L.",
