    "question": "A student places a 0.40 kg glider on an air track of negligible friction and holds it so that it touches an uncompressed ideal spring, as shown in Figure 1 above. The student then pushes the glider back to compress the spring by 0.25 m, as shown in Figure 2. At time t = 0, the student releases the glider, and a motion sensor begins recording the velocity of the reflector at the front of the glider as a function of time. The data points are shown in the table below. At time t = 0.79 s, the glider loses contact with the spring.\n\nOn the axes below, plot the data points for velocity v as a function of time t for the glider, and draw a smooth curve that best fits the data. Be sure to label an appropriate scale on the vertical axis.\n\nThe student wishes to use the data to plot position x as a function of time t for the glider.\n\nDescribe a method the student could use to do this.\n\nOn the axes below, sketch the position x as a function of time t for the glider. Explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values or algebraic expressions, as appropriate.\n\nCalculate the time at which the glider makes contact with the bumper at the far right.\n\nCalculate the force constant of the spring.\n\nThe experiment is run again, but this time the glider is attached to the spring rather than simply being pushed against it.\n\nDetermine the amplitude of the resulting periodic motion.\n\nCalculate the period of oscillation of the resulting periodic motion.",
