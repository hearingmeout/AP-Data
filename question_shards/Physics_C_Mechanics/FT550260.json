    "question": "A small dart of mass 0.020 kg is launched at an angle of 30° above the horizontal with an initial speed of 10 m/s. At the moment it reaches the highest point in its path and is moving horizontally, it collides with and sticks to a wooden block of mass 0.10 kg that is suspended at the end of a massless string. The center of mass of the block is 1.2 m below the pivot point of the string. The block and dart then swing up until the string makes an angle θ with the vertical, as shown above. Air resistance is negligible.\n\nDetermine the speed of the dart just before it strikes the block.\n\nCalculate the horizontal distance d between the launching point of the dart and a point on the floor directly below the block.\n\nCalculate the speed of the block just after the dart strikes.\n\nCalculate the angle θ through which the dart and block on the string will rise before coming momentarily to rest.\n\nThe block then continues to swing as a simple pendulum. Calculate the time between when the dart collides with the block and when the block first returns to its original position.\n\nIn a second experiment, a dart with more mass is launched at the same speed and angle. The dart collides with and sticks to the same wooden block.\n\nWould the angle θ that the dart and block swing to increase, decrease, or stay the same?\n\n_____ Increase _____ Decrease _____ Stay the same\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nWould the period of oscillation after the collision increase, decrease, or stay the same?\n\n_____ Increase _____ Decrease _____ Stay the same\n\nJustify your answer.",
