    "question": "A block of mass 2M rests on a horizontal, frictionless table and is attached to a relaxed spring, as shown in the figure above. The spring is nonlinear and exerts a force F(x) = –Bx3, where B is a positive constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium for the spring. A block of mass 3M and initial speed v0 is moving to the left as shown.\n\nOn the dots below, which represent the blocks of mass 2M and 3M, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on each block before they collide. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the appropriate dot.\n\nThe two blocks collide and stick to each other. The two-block system then compresses the spring a maximum distance D, as shown above. Express your answers to parts b., c., and d. in terms of M, B, v0 , and physical constants, as appropriate.\n\nDerive an expression for the speed of the blocks immediately after the collision.\n\nDetermine an expression for the kinetic energy of the two-block system immediately after the collision.\n\nDerive an expression for the maximum distance D that the spring is compressed.\n\nIn which direction is the net force, if any, on the block of mass 2M when the spring is at maximum compression?\n\n____ Left ____ Right ____ The net force on the block of mass 2M is zero.\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nWhich of the following correctly describes the magnitude of the net force on each of the two blocks when the spring is at maximum compression?\n\n____ The magnitude of the net force is greater on the block of mass 2M.\n\n____ The magnitude of the net force is greater on the block of mass 3M.\n\n____ The magnitude of the net force on each block has the same nonzero value.\n\n____ The magnitude of the net force on each block is zero.\n\nJustify your answer.\n\nDo the two blocks, which remain stuck together and attached to the spring, exhibit simple harmonic motion after the collision?\n\n____ Yes ____ No\n\nJustify your answer.",
