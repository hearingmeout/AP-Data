    "question": "Student 1 is standing on a cart holding a small stone, while student 2 is standing at rest on the ground, as shown in the figure above. The cart is moving at a constant speed v in the +x-direction, as indicated by the coordinate system shown. Student 1 drops the stone precisely when passing student 2. Which of the following best represents the path of the falling stone relative to student 1 and the path of the falling stone relative to student 2 ?",
