    "question": "Two identical, unlabeled boxes are transported to an orbiting space station. The astronauts know that one box is filled with a light sample of ants for an experiment, and the other is filled with heavy tools for repairs. How can the astronauts tell, without opening the boxes, which box has the tools?",
