    "question": "Two carts of equal mass are on a horizontal surface with negligible friction. Cart A is approaching cart B, which is at rest, as shown in Figure 1 above. Attached to cart B is a spring that is initially compressed. At the moment cart A collides with cart B, the spring is released and pushes on cart A, as shown in Figure 2 above. Which of the following correctly states what happens to the kinetic energy and the momentum of the two-cart system as a result of the collision compared to those quantities before the collision?",
