    "description": "A ball of mass 2.0 kg is thrown vertically upward from the top of a building. The ball’s velocity v is given as a function of time t by the equation v(t) = R - St, where R = 5 m/s and S = 10 m/s2. The positive direction is upward.",
    "question": "What is the ball’s acceleration at time t = 1 s?",
