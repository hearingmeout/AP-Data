    "description": "A solid disk of mass M and radius R is freely rotating horizontally in a counterclockwise direction with angular speed ω about a vertical axis through its center with negligible friction. The rotational inertia MR2/2 of the disk is . A second identical disk is at rest and suspended above the first disk with the centers of the two disks aligned, as shown in the figure above. There is no contact between the disks. The second disk is dropped onto the first disk, and after a short time they rotate counterclockwise with the same angular speed ωf.",
    "question": "Which of the following properties of the two-disk system must be conserved between the time the second disk is dropped on the first disk and the time that the two disks begin rotating with the same speed?",
