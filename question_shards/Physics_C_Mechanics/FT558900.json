    "question": "Blocks A, B, and C are aligned along a straight line on a horizontal frictionless surface. The masses of the blocks are M, 2M, and 3M, respectively. Block A is initially moving to the right along the same line at a speed v, as shown in the figure above. Blocks B and C are initially at rest. Block A collides with and sticks to block B. The two blocks then collide with and stick to block C. What is the speed of block C after the collisions?",
