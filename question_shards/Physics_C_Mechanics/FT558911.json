    "description": "An object is initially hanging in equilibrium from a vertical spring. The object is pulled down 15 cm from its equilibrium position, as illustrated above, and released at time t = 0. The object then oscillates with a period of 2.0 s. Let x = 0 be the equilibrium position and let the positive direction be upward.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements is true of the magnitude of the acceleration of the object at time t = 1.0 s?",
