    "question": "A spring of negligible mass and with a spring constant of 50 N/m is hung vertically, as shown above in the figure on the left. A block of mass 1.0 kg is attached to the spring and slowly lowered a distance x0 until it hangs at rest at the equilibrium position, as shown above in the figure on the right.\n\n(a) On the dot below that represents the block, draw and label the forces (not components) that act on the block when it is at the equilibrium position shown. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing away from, the dot.\n\n(b) Calculate the distance x0 that the spring is stretched from its original length to the equilibrium position.\n\nWhile the 1.0 kg block is in equilibrium, a 0.20 kg ball of clay is launched with speed v0 vertically from the ground 1.0 meter below the hanging block. The clay has speed v1 = 5.0 m/s when it collides with the block.\n\n(c) Calculate the speed v0 .\n\nUpon impact, the clay sticks to the 1.0 kg block.\n\n(d)\n\nCalculate the speed of the block immediately after the collision.\n\nCalculate the kinetic energy lost in the collision.\n\nDetermine the period of oscillation for the block-clay-spring system.\n\n(e) When the oscillating block-clay-spring system reaches its maximum speed after the collision, will the spring be stretched from its original length by a distance greater than, less than, or equal to x0 ?\n\n____ Greater than ____ Less than ____ Equal to\n\nJustify your answer.\n\n(f) The collision is repeated using a rubber ball with the same mass as the ball of clay. The rubber ball is launched vertically with the same speed v0 . The collision between the rubber ball and the block is elastic. Will the speed of the block immediately after colliding with the rubber ball be greater than, less than, or equal to the speed of the block you calculated in part (d)i ?\n\n____ Greater than ____ Less than ____ Equal to\n\nJustify your answer.",
