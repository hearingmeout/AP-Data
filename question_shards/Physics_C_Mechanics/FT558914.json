    "question": "A sphere of mass m and radius r is released from rest at the top of a curved track of height H. The sphere travels down the curved track and around a loop of radius R. The sphere rolls without slipping during the entire motion. Point A on the loop is at height R, and point B is at the top of the loop. The rotational inertia of the sphere is 2mr2/5. Express all of your answers in parts (a) through (d) in terms of m, r, H, R, and physical constants, as appropriate. Assume r << R. (a) On the dots below, which represent the sphere, draw and label the forces (not components) that are exerted on the sphere at point A and at point B, respectively. Each force must be represented by a distinct arrow starting on and pointing away from the dot. (b) Derive an expression for the speed of the sphere at point A. Derive an expression for the normal force the track exerts on the sphere at point A. (c) Calculate the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the translational kinetic energy of the sphere at point A. (d) The minimum release height necessary for the sphere to travel around the loop and not lose contact with the loop at point B is HMIN . The sphere is replaced with a hoop of the same mass and radius. Will the value of HMIN increase, decrease, or stay the same? ____ Increase ____ Decrease ____ Stay the same Justify your answer. The sphere is again released from a known height H and eventually leaves the track at point C, which is a height R above the bottom of the loop, as shown in the figure above. The track makes an angle of θ above the horizontal at point C. Express your answer in part (e) in terms of m, r, H, R, θ, and physical constants, as appropriate. (e) Calculate the maximum height above the bottom of the loop that the sphere will reach.",
