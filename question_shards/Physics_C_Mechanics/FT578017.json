    "description": "A sphere on the end of a string is released from rest at point X and swings through point Y to point Z, as shown in the figure above. Point Y is the lowest point for the sphere as it swings. Air resistance is negligible.",
    "question": "Four directions at point Y are indicated as I, II, III, and IV in the figure above. Directions I and III are vertical, II and IV are horizontal, and I is directed along the string. Which of the following best indicates the direction of the acceleration of the sphere at point Y?",
