    "question": "A 300 g cart with a force sensor attached starts at rest on a track. The force sensor exerts a force on the cart to speed it up. The graph above shows the force F exerted by the sensor on the cart as a function of time t. The change in the cart’s momentum during the time interval shown is most nearly",
