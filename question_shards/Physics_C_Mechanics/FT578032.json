The curve begins above the horizontal t axis, and to the left of the vertical a axis. It extends downward and to the right, crossing the t axis to the left of the origin, and crossing the a axis below the origin. It reaches a minimum shortly after crossing the a axis, then extends upward and to the right, crossing the t axis to the right of the origin. It continues upward, reaches a maximum, then turns back downward again, crossing the t axis, and reaching a minimum before turning back upward. This is the stem graph flipped vertically.",
