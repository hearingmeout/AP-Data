    "description": "Three identical spheres are thrown from the same height above the ground. Sphere X is thrown vertically up, sphere Y is thrown horizontally, and sphere Z is thrown vertically down, as shown in figures 1, 2, and 3 above, respectively. All three spheres are thrown with the same speed. Air resistance is negligible.",
