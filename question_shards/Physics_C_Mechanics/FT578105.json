    "description": "In order to model the motion of an extinct ape, scientists measure its hand and arm bones. From shoulder to wrist, the arm bones are 0.60 m long and their mass is 4.0 kg. From wrist to the tip of the fingers, the hand bones are 0.10 m long and their mass is 1.0 kg. In the model above, each bone is assumed to have a uniform density.",
    "question": "When the arm and hand hang straight down, the distance from the shoulder to the center of mass of the arm-hand system is most nearly",
