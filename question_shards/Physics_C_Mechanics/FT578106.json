    "description": "In order to model the motion of an extinct ape, scientists measure its hand and arm bones. From shoulder to wrist, the arm bones are 0.60 m long and their mass is 4.0 kg. From wrist to the tip of the fingers, the hand bones are 0.10 m long and their mass is 1.0 kg. In the model above, each bone is assumed to have a uniform density.",
    "question": "The arm is held in the horizontal position and the hand is bent at the wrist so the fingers point up, as shown in the figure above. The torque exerted by the weight of the hand with respect to the shoulder is most nearly",
