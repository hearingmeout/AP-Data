    "question": "Two balls, A and B, have the same mass and diameter but are made from different types of rubber. The balls are dropped from the same height above the floor. After colliding with the floor, ball A bounces higher than ball B bounces. Which of the following quantities must necessarily be larger for ball A than for ball B?",
