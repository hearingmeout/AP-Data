    "question": "Two spherical magnetic marbles of equal mass approach each other with equal speeds from opposite directions, with their edges along the same line. When they are side by side, they connect and move as a system. Consider the effects of friction and spin to be negligible. Which statement correctly describes any changes in the angular momentum of an individual marble or of the two-marble system?",
