    "question": "A box is initially held at rest on a ramp with an incline of <math alttext=\"37 degrees\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msup><mn>37</mn><mo>∘</mo></msup></math> with respect to the horizontal and then released. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the box and the ramp are <math alttext=\"0.50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.50</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"0.20\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.20</mn></math>, respectively. Which of the following best describes the motion, if any, of the box after it is released?",
