    "question": "A toy water launcher, initially full of water, can slide with negligible friction on a horizontal surface. Water is ejected horizontally from the launcher with a constant speed relative to the launcher. The mass of water ejected from the launcher over any time interval of length <math alttext=\"delta t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></math> is constant as well. Which of the following statements correctly describes how the launcher moves, if at all, and provides a correct justification?",
