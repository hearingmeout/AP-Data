    "question": "A student is testing the kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motion by measuring the time it takes for light-weight plastic balls to fall to the floor from a height of 3 m in the lab. The student predicts the time to fall using g as 9.80 m/s2 but finds the measured time to be 35% greater. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the large percent error?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The acceleration due to gravity is 70% greater than 9.80 m/s2 at this location.",
