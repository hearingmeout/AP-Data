    "question": "An object undergoes simple harmonic motion along the x-axis shown above, where x = 0 is the object’s equilibrium position. Which of the following graphs best shows the relationship between the object’s acceleration a and its displacement x from equilibrium? (Assume positive a to be acceleration directed to the right.)",
