    "question": "A group of students are using objects with different masses oscillating on the end of a horizontal ideal spring to determine the spring constant of the spring. The students are varying the mass of the object oscillating on the end of the spring and measuring the period of oscillation. The students then graph the data as the square of the period as a function of the mass in order to use the slope of the graph to determine the spring constant. One student notices that they are not keeping the amplitude of the oscillation constant when they start the oscillation. Several students discuss if this will affect their data or not and how to correct the issue if necessary. Which of the following student statements is correct?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The amplitude affects the period; thus, the period should be cubed, not squared, prior to graphing.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The amplitude affects the period; thus, the amplitude must be kept constant for every trial.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The amplitude affects the period; thus, the amplitude should be adjusted depending on the mass of the object.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The amplitude does not affect the period, because the oscillation is horizontal, not vertical.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The amplitude does not affect the period, because the spring is an ideal spring.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The amplitude does not affect the period, because the spring is an ideal spring."
