    "question": "An ice skater begins to spin in the \"camel\" position, as shown in the figure. As she continues to spin, she stands upright, pulls her arms to her chest, and crosses her legs to spin in the \"corkscrew\" position, as shown in the figure. If friction between the skater and the ice is negligible, which of the following claims is true as the skater moves from the \"camel\" position to the \"corkscrew\" position?",
