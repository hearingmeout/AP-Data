    "question": "A skier of mass M is skiing down a frictionless hill that makes an angle θ with the horizontal, as shown in the diagram. The skier starts from rest at time t = 0 and is subject to a velocity-dependent drag force due to air resistance of the form F = –bv, where v is the velocity of the skier and b is a positive constant. Express all algebraic answers in terms of M, b, θ , and fundamental constants. On the dot below that represents the skier, draw a free-body diagram indicating and labeling all of the forces that act on the skier while the skier descends the hill. Write a differential equation that can be used to solve for the velocity of the skier as a function of time. Determine an expression for the terminal velocity vT of the skier. Solve the differential equation in part b. to determine the velocity of the skier as a function of time, showing all your steps. On the axes below, sketch a graph of the acceleration a of the skier as a function of time t, and indicate the initial value of a. Take downhill as positive.",
