    "question": "Show all your work for each part of the question. The parts within the question may not have equal weight. A projectile launcher, shown in Figure 1, can launch small blocks that have a certain size and shape. The launcher uses an internal spring, which cannot be removed and is not accessible, that is always compressed by the same distance prior to launching a block. A group of students wish to experimentally determine the amount of energy <math alttext=\"E sub L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></math> that is stored in the spring prior to a launch. The students have a collection of blocks of different mass that are all of the right size and shape to be used in the launcher. (a) Describe an experimental procedure to collect data that would allow the students to determine <math alttext=\"E sub L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></math> by making a linear graph. Provide enough detail so that the experiment could be replicated, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty.",
