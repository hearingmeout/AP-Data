    "question": "Two disks each rotate about axes through the their centers, and are connected by a belt that does not slip as the disks rotate, as shown in the figure. The disk on the left has a larger radius than the disk on the right. Points <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>L</mtext></math> and <math alttext=\"uppercase R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>R</mtext></math> are points at the edges of the disks on the left and right, respectively. Are the angular speeds and linear speeds of points <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>L</mtext></math> and <math alttext=\"uppercase R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>R</mtext></math> the same or different?",
