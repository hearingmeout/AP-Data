    "question": "A block is moving on a surface that is inclined at an angle above the horizontal, as shown in the figure. The graph shown represents the gravitational potential energy <math alttext=\"U sub g\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> of the block-Earth system as a function of the position <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> along the incline. The time period depicted in the graph is the time during which the block slides up the surface, comes to a stop, and then slides back down. Which of the following graphs shows the work <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>done by the gravitational force during the same time period?",
