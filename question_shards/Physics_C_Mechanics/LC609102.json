    "question": "The suggested time for this section is 25 minutes with 5 minutes for uploading your answers. If you find you are in need of symbolic notation that is too difficult to type, you may identify a non-standard symbol and use that throughout your answer. For example, you may identify Q as the symbol you will use instead of the q for angle measurement. A student is analyzing the section of roller coaster track shown above. The track consists of two segments. Between point A and point B, the track resembles the top half of a parabola that opens to the right. The track then smoothly transitions to a half-circle between points B and D, with D as the lowest point on the half-circle. A roller coaster car is released from rest at point A on the track. The car is fitted with two sets of wheels so that the car cannot lose contact with the track. Assume that any effects of friction or air resistance can be ignored.",

The students also know that the car is located at point A at time \\(t\\ =0\\ \\)s, at point B at time \\(t\\ =\\ 5\\) s, and point D at time \\(t\\ =\\ 10\\)s. The student hasn’t taken AP Physics and doesn’t know how to solve the problem exactly, so instead they suggest that the distance x traveled by the car can be modeled by the function \\(x\\left(t\\right)=6t^2-0.4t^3\\), where x is the distance (in meters) the car has traveled past point A, and t is the time (in seconds) since the car was released from point A. In the next questions you’ll be asked to evaluate how well this model matches physics principles. A graph representing the suggested equation x(t) is shown below. A second student agrees that from \\(t=0\\ s\\) to \\(t=5\\ s\\) , the graph could correctly model the motion of the car. Identify at least two features in the graph that are consistent with the behavior that a cart must have it is travels over the track described. Explain how the graph could correctly model the motion of the car during the first 5 seconds.",
