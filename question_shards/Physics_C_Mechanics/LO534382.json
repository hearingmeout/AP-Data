    "question": "A motion sensor and a force sensor record the motion of a cart along a track, as shown above. The cart is given a push so that it moves toward the force sensor and then collides with it. The two sensors record the values shown in the following graphs. Determine the cart’s average acceleration between t = 0.33 s and t = 0.37 s. Determine the magnitude of the change in the cart’s momentum during the collision. Determine the mass of the cart. Determine the energy lost in the collision between the force sensor and the cart.",
