    "question": "A boy stands in a large bucket used to lift humans to higher elevations. The combined weight of the boy and bucket is <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. The bucket has a lightweight rope attached to its top and extending up and over a simple pulley that is attached to the ceiling high above the boy. The rope is long enough to come back down to his hands, as shown. As the boy pulls himself upward, he applies a force <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> to the rope. Which of the following claims indicates a correct relationship between <math alttext=\"F\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>and provides appropriate reasoning?",
