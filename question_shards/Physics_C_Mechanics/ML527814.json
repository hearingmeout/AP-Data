    "question": "After a long time, as the rocket moves farther away from the planet, what happens to the rocket’s speed, and what reasoning supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The speed approaches zero. As the rocket moves farther away from the planet, both the potential energy of the rocket-planet system and kinetic energy of the rocket approach zero.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The speed approaches zero. Even if the rocket moves beyond the planet’s gravity there must always be a force from the engine to keep it moving.",

      {
        "label": "The speed approaches a positive value. Once the rocket is beyond the planet’s gravity its speed remains constant because the net force on it is zero.",

      {
        "label": "The speed approaches a positive value. The potential energy of the rocket-planet system is increasing, and the rocket’s kinetic energy is already a positive value.",
