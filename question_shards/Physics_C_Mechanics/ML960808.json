    "question": "A block on a horizontal surface is connected to a horizontal spring, and the other end of the spring is fixed in place. The block is oscillating to the left and to the right as it moves with negligible friction on the surface. The velocity of the block as a function of time is <math alttext=\"v of t equals, v sub max, the cosine of, open parenthesis, omega t, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mi>cos</mi><mtext> </mtext><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>ω</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>, where <math alttext=\"v sub max\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>max</mi></msub></mstyle></math> is a positive constant and the positive direction is taken to be to the right.
