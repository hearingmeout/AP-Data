    "question": "A block of mass m is pulled across a rough surface, as shown above. The coefficient of friction between the block and the surface is µ𝑘 . The force F that pulls the block is exerted at the angle 𝜙 shown. Which of the following is an expression for the magnitude of the frictional force on the block if it is moving at constant speed?",
