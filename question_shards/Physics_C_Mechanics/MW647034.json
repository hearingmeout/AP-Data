    "question": "Two identical blocks are placed on a table as shown in the figure. The block on the left is attached to another identical block hanging over the edge of the table. The block on the right is attached to a motor pulling downward with a constant tension equal to the weight of one block. The mass of the strings and friction between the blocks and table are negligible and the pulleys are ideal. How do the magnitudes of the acceleration of the blocks compare and why?",
