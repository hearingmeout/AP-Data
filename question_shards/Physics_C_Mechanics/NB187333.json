    "question": "A student holds onto a roll of paper, as shown in the figure. At time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, the student drops the roll while still holding onto the end of the paper, allowing the paper to unroll as it falls. At <math alttext=\"t equals t sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>, the unrolled strip of paper rips, allowing the remaining roll of paper to fall freely. Which of the following graphs best describes the angular velocity of the roll as a function of <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> ? Assume that the mass of the paper unrolls during the time interval <math alttext=\"0 is less than t, which is less than t sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mstyle></math> does not significantly change the mass of the remaining roll of paper.",
