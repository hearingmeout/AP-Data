    "question": "A block is released from rest from the top of a ramp. The block slides down the ramp and then collides with and compresses a spring. Friction between the block and the ramp is negligible. A student claims that the kinetic energy of the block is the largest at the moment the block collides with the spring. Which of the following correctly identifies if the student’s claim is true or false, and provides correct justification?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The claim is true. The block immediately begins to slow down as soon as it collides with the spring because the spring is exerting a force on the block.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is true. The block stops immediately after making contact with the spring, losing all kinetic energy.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is false. The block speeds up until the net force on the block is zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The claim is false. The block speeds up for its entire motion down the plane.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The claim is false. The block speeds up until the net force on the block is zero."
