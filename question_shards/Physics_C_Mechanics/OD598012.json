    "question": "Blocks X and Y of masses 3.0 kg and 5.0 kg, respectively, are connected by a light string and are both on a level horizontal surface of negligible friction. A force F = 12 N is exerted on block Y, as shown in the figure above. What is the tension in the string connecting the two blocks?",
