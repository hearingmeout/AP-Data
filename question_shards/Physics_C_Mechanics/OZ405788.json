In the graph labeled Car, the line begins approximately one third of the way along the horizontal axis, and moves steeply upward and to the right, until it reaches approximately three fourths of the way up the vertical axis, and just to the right of where the line began on the horizontal axis. At this point, the line moves steeply downward and to the right, ending on the horizontal axis. In the graph labeled Truck, the line begins approximately two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis, and moves steeply upward and to the right, until it reaches near the top of the vertical axis, and a little to the right of where the line began on the horizontal axis. At this point, the line moves steeply downward and to the right, ending on the horizontal axis.",
