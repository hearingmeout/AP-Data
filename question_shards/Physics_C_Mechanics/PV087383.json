    "question": "Which of the following provides a velocity-time graph that could correspond to the diagram and provides correct reasoning? Velocity-Time Graph Reasoning A The distance traveled by the block during each half-second interval increases, so the velocity of the block must increase. B The block is traveling in the positive <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math>-direction, so the velocity graph must have a positive slope. C The force of friction exerted on the block causes the acceleration of the block to decrease. D The block reaches a constant speed.",
