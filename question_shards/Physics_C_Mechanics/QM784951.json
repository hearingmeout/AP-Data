    "question": "The two graphs show the net torque exerted on two rotating objects, a cylinder, and a sphere, as a function of time. If both objects are initially rotating in the positive direction, taken to be counterclockwise, for which object does the angular momentum decrease in magnitude during the time interval shown? What reasoning supports the claim?",
