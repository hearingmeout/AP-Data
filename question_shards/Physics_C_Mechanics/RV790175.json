    "question": "A bar of length <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> meter is thrown vertically upward, with an initial translational velocity of <math alttext=\"v sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> for its center of mass and an initial angular velocity of <math alttext=\"omega sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>ω</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>. The bar continues to spin as it travels upward and then falls back downward. Which of the following is a correct claim about the rotational equilibrium about the center of mass and the translational equilibrium of the bar at the instant its center of mass has reached its maximum height?",
