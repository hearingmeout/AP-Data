    "question": "A toy car pushes two identical blocks, Block <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and Block <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>, up an inclined ramp at a constant velocity, as shown. The force of friction between the incline and the blocks is negligible. Which of the following pairs of free-body diagrams best represent the free-body diagrams for Block <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and Block <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>?",
