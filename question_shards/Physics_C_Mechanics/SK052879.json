Four evenly spaced tick marks are on the horizontal axis to the right of the origin on each graph. In choice A, a curve is plotted starting at the origin and increasing and concave down until the first tick mark, where a dashed vertical line from the tick mark meets the curve. The curve then becomes horizontal until the third tick mark, where a dashed vertical line from that tick mark meets the line. The line then becomes a curve that is decreasing and concave down until reaching the horizontal axis at the fourth tick mark.",
