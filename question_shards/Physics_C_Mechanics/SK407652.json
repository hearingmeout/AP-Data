    "question": "An experiment is performed on a frictionless surface consisting of a horizontal section and a ramp inclined at a 20 degree angle. Block A of mass 3.0 kg rests on the horizontal section against but not attached to an ideal spring at its equilibrium length, as shown in the figure above. The spring has a spring constant of k = 700 N/m . Block A is pushed to the left, compressing the spring 0.15 m, and then released. (a) Calculate the speed of block A when it leaves the spring. (b) Calculate the maximum distance d block A travels up the ramp. (c) On the axis below, sketch a graph of the speed v of block A as a function of time t from t = 0 to t = t3. Block A is released at time t = 0, loses contact with the spring at time t = t1, transitions to the ramp at time t = t2 , and reaches its maximum height at time t = t3. In a second experiment, block B, of mass 0.50 kg, is placed on the ramp a distance of d from the bottom of the ramp and held in place. Block A is released from the spring as in the first experiment. Block B is released from rest so that it collides with block A as block A travels up the ramp. The two blocks collide at a distance of d/2 up the ramp. The blocks stick together after the collision. (d) Calculate the speed of the two blocks immediately after the collision. In what direction, if any, are the two blocks moving immediately after the collision? ____ Up the ramp ____ Down the ramp ____ Undefined, because the blocks momentarily come to rest after the collision (e) Calculate the magnitude of the impulse exerted on block A by block B. In what direction, if any, is the impulse exerted on block A by block B ? ____ Up the ramp ____ Down the ramp ____ Undefined, because the impulse is zero",
