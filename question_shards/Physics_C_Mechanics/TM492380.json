    "question": "A glider on a horizontal air track with negligible friction has a constant rightward force exerted on it between time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"t equals t sub f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></math>. At <math alttext=\"t equals t sub f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></math> the rightward force suddenly becomes zero and remains zero. Which of the following graphs of velocity as a function of time best describes the motion of the glider?",
