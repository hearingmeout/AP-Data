The experiment must use a setup which consists of a pivot of negligible friction and the uniform rod, as shown. The students do not have access to a mass scale of any kind, but they have access to a set of known masses and other equipment commonly found in a high school physics laboratory. The students are expected to find the mass of the rod by plotting their data in a graph.
