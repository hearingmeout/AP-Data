    "question": "A small block of mass MB = 0.50 kg is placed on a long slab of mass MS = 3.0 kg as shown above. Initially, the slab is at rest and the block has a speed v0 of 4.0 m/s to the right. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the slab is 0.20, and there is no friction between the slab and the horizontal surface on which it moves. On the dots below that represent the block and the slab, draw and label vectors to represent the forces acting on each as the block slides on the slab. At some moment later, before the block reaches the right end of the slab, both the block and the slab attain identical speeds vƒ . b. Calculate vƒ . c. Calculate the distance the slab has traveled at the moment it reaches vƒ . d. Calculate the work done by friction on the slab from the beginning of its motion until it reaches vƒ .",
