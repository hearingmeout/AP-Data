    "question": "A truck of mass <math alttext=\"m sub uppercase T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>T</mtext></msub></math> is initially at rest with a load of sand of initial mass <math alttext=\"m sub S\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>s</mtext></msub></math>. At time <math alttext=\"lowercase t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>, the truck is pushed forward by a constant force <math alttext=\"F sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> and the sand begins to leave the truck, as shown. The mass of sand that has left the truck as a function of time <math alttext=\"lowercase t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> is given by <math alttext=\"C times lowercase t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>C</mi><mi>t</mi></math>, where <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>C</mi></math> is a positive constant with appropriate units. At time <math alttext=\"lowercase t sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> there is no sand left in the truck. Which of the following graphs most nearly shows the velocity <math alttext=\"v sub uppercase T\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mtext>T</mtext></msub></math> of the truck as a function of time?",
