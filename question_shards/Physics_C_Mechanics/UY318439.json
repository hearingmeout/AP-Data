The curve is a parabola that begins three quarters of the way down the vertical axis, and opens downward. It crosses the horizontal axis just to the right of the origin on its way upward and then again crosses the horizontal origin far to the right of the origin on its way downward. The maximum is above the horizontal axis, about halfway along the horizontal axis.",

At this point, the curve moves very gradually downward and to the right until it ends.",
