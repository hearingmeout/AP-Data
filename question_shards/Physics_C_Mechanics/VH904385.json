    "description": "A skater on ice begins to spin in the camel position, as shown in the figure to the left below. As she continues to spin, she straightens up, pulls her arms to her chest, and crosses her legs to spin in the corkscrew position, as shown in the figure to the right below. Air resistance and friction are negligible as the skater spins.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements about the skater’s motion is true as she moves from the camel position to the corkscrew position?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Her rotational kinetic energy increases because she does work on her arms and legs to bring them inward.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Her rotational kinetic energy increases because her potential energy decreases.",

      {
        "label": "Her rotational kinetic energy remains the same because there is negligible frictional torque.",
