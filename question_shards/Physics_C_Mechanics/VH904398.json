    "description": "A skater on ice begins to spin in the camel position, as shown in the figure to the left below. As she continues to spin, she straightens up, pulls her arms to her chest, and crosses her legs to spin in the corkscrew position, as shown in the figure to the right below. Air resistance and friction are negligible as the skater spins.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements about the skater’s motion is true?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Her rotational inertia increases when she moves to the corkscrew position because her angular speed increases.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Her rotational inertia increases when she moves to the corkscrew position because her mass is distributed closer to her axis of rotation.",

      {
        "label": "Her rotational inertia remains the same when she moves to the corkscrew position because there is negligible frictional torque.",

      }

    "answer": "Her rotational inertia decreases when she moves to the corkscrew position because her mass is distributed closer to her axis of rotation."
