    "question": "Pairs of students stand in two rows separated by four meters and face each other. Each pair of students has a large ball. The students pass the balls from their chest to their partners’ chest, as shown. A video camera is used to film this interaction. When viewing the video, the students note that the highest point in the trajectories of all the balls are nearly the same height above the ground. Which of the following claims is supported by this evidence?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The students threw the ball to their partner with nearly the same speed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The students threw the ball to their partner at nearly the same angle to the horizontal.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The time the ball is in the air is nearly the same for each ball.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is impossible for the balls to not go to the same height, because the distance between each pair of students is the same.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Each ball must have the same mass.",

    ],
    "answer": "The time the ball is in the air is nearly the same for each ball."
