    "description": "An experiment is set up using a hanging mass to pull a cart along a horizontal track. A light string is attached from the hanging mass over a pulley to a force sensor. A second light string is attached from the force sensor to the cart. There is a motion sensor that can be used to measure different features of the motion of the cart. The pulley is ideal, and there is negligible friction between the cart and the track.",
    "question": "The hanging mass is released. Which of the following sets of graphs could represent output from the motion sensor and the force sensor?",
