    "question": "A small toy rocket is in a horizontal position, at rest on a horizontal surface of negligible friction. A rope is attached to the rocket and the other end of the rope is held in place, as shown in the figures. As the rocket burns fuel, the rocket accelerates and the rope exerts a force on the rocket. The resulting motion is the rocket accelerating in non-uniform circular motion in a horizontal circle. Below are four free-body diagrams, two for each view, with a dot representing the rocket and vectors representing forces exerted on the rocket as the rocket moves in the non-uniform circular motion. Which of the diagrams are correct representations of the forces on the rocket when it is in the position shown in the figures?",
