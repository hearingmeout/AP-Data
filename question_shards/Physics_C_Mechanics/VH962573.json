    "question": "A person on an amusement park ride is inside a circular room that is spinning counterclockwise on a vertical axis when viewed from above (known as a rotor ride). At a given moment, the person is to the right of the center of the room as shown above. The room is spinning fast enough that the person remains held against the wall as the floor drops and does not move downward. The following figures show free-body diagrams of the person in the room and the surface of the wall. Which of the sets of figures is correct for the moment described above?",
