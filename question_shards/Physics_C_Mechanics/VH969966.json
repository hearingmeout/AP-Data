    "question": "The swing shown above is attached to a rope that passes over an ideal pulley and then back down to the hands of a child sitting on the swing. The tensions in the rope on the left and one the right are <math alttext=\"T sub L\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"T sub R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, respectively, and the weight of the child plus the swing is <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>. Which of the following free-body diagrams best shows the child and the swing if they are to remain at rest and in equilibrium?",
