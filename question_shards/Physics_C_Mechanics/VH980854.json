    "description": "Two blocks of equal mass are connected by a string that passes over a pulley, as shown in the figure. Block 1 hangs from the string, and block 2 can slide on a table. The system is released from rest. Using conservation of energy, a student derives an expression for the speed <math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of block 1 when it has fallen a distance <math alttext=\"h\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> after the system has been released from rest and obtains the equation <math alttext=\"v equals the square root of g h \" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mi>g</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow></msqrt></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
