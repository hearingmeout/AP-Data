    "question": "In an experiment, a cart of mass <math alttext=\"m \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is set up on a horizontal surface of negligible friction. A group of students push the cart toward an ideal spring of spring constant <math alttext=\"k\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> that is attached to a vertical surface. A motion sensor is set up behind the cart, and a force sensor is attached to the cart, as shown in the figure. The motion sensor is used to measure the position and speed of the cart, and the force sensor is used to determine the force the spring exerts on the cart. Which of the following hypotheses can this experiment be used to test?",
