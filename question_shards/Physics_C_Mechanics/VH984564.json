    "question": "A student designs an experiment to verify dependence of the mass <math alttext=\"m\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of an object attached to a spring, on the period <math alttext=\"T\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> for an oscillating vertical spring-object system. The student attaches a hanger to a spring, places weights on the hanger, pulls the hanger down, releases it from rest, and measures the corresponding period of oscillation for the hanger. However, during data entry, the student neglects to add the mass of the hanger to the values of the attached masses for the spring. The student constructs a graph of the data to determine if the data agrees with the equation <math alttext=\"T equals 2 pi times the square root of the fraction m over k\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi><msqrt><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></msqrt></mrow></mstyle></math>,where <math alttext=\"k\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> equals the elastic constant of spring. Which of the following graphs best represents the student’s recorded data?",
