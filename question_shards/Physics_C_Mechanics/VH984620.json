    "question": "Figure 1 shows a block that slides up a rough incline, momentarily comes to rest near the top of the incline, and then slides back down the incline. Figure 2 shows a free-body diagram for the block as it moves up the incline, where <math alttext=\"N\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is the normal force, <math alttext=\"lowercase f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is the force of friction, and <math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> is the force of Earth’s gravity. Figure 3 shows a free-body diagram for the block as it moves down the incline. Based on these figures, which of the following is a correct statement?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Since friction changes direction as the block’s motion changes direction, friction is a conservative force.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Since friction is always against the motion of the block, the total work done by friction is zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Since the normal force is always perpendicular to the motion, the normal force is a conservative force.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Since a component of gravity is always directed toward the original position of the block, gravity is a conservative force.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Since gravity is with the motion of the block up the incline and also with the motion of the block down the incline, gravity is a nonconservative force.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Since a component of gravity is always directed toward the original position of the block, gravity is a conservative force."
