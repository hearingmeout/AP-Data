Stone <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is thrown vertically downward and stone <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> is thrown horizontally. If the stones are thrown at the same time and air resistance is negligible, which of the following is true?",
