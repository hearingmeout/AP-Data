    "question": "A box is sent up a ramp with an initial speed of <math alttext=\"v sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, as shown in the figure above. The box stops before reaching the top of the ramp and then slides back down the ramp. There is friction between the box and the ramp. If the positive direction is up the ramp, which of the following graphs best represents the velocity <math alttext=\"v\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> of the box as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> as it travels along the ramp?",
