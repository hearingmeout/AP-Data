    "question": "Two disks have equal masses and radii. Disk <math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> is solid, and Disk <math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> is hollow. Each disk has a thin string wrapped around it. Both strings are attached to the ceiling as shown. The disks are simultaneously released from rest from the same height. Which of the following accurately describes which disk will hit the ground first and why?",
