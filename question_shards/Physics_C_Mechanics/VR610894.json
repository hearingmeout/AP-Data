    "question": "The motion of an object moving along a straight line is described by the acceleration versus time graph in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. A student claims that the motion of the object can also be represented by the velocity versus time graph in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. Which of the following correctly states whether or not the student’s claim is true and explains why?",

      {
        "label": "Yes, because the slope of the graph of acceleration versus time is constant, so the velocity of the object approaches a constant value.",
