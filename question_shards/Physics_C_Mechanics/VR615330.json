    "question": "A student pushes a block of mass <math alttext=\"M sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>M</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> over a rough horizontal surface at a constant velocity of <math alttext=\"3 meters per second\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn><mtext> m/s</mtext></math> to the right, as shown in the figure. A free-body diagram of just the horizontal forces exerted on the block is also shown. A larger block of mass <math alttext=\"2 M sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><msub><mi>M</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> is then placed on top of the smaller block. The student again pushes the smaller block so that both blocks move together with the same constant velocity of <math alttext=\"3 meters per second\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn><mtext> m/s</mtext></math> to the right. Which of the following free-body diagrams best represents the horizontal forces exerted on the bottom block in the second situation? The arrows representing the forces are all drawn to scale.",
