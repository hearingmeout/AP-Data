    "question": "An object moves with increasing speed horizontally to the right as it is pulled across a rough horizontal surface by a rope. A student has drawn the free body diagram shown in the figure. The diagram indicates the forces exerted on the object, all drawn to scale. However, the diagram has an error. Which of the following best justifies why the diagram cannot correctly represent the forces that are exerted on the object as it moves?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The object cannot be gaining speed with the forces drawn as shown.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The object would be slowing down with the forces drawn as shown.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The object would be gaining speed vertically with the forces drawn as shown.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The normal force must be equal to the weight of the object.",
        "image": null
      }
