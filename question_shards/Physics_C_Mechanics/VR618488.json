    "question": "A uniform sheet of cardboard is cut into an “<math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">L</mi></math>” shape as shown. One end of string is attached at point <math alttext=\"P\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi></math>, and the object is held vertically at rest by the string. Which of the following diagrams best represents this rest position as the shape is supported by the string?",
