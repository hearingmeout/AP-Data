    "question": "A bar with a non-uniform density is launched from the ground with an initial center-of-mass speed <math alttext=\"v sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> at an angle <math alttext=\"theta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>θ</mi></math> above the horizontal and lands at the same level from which it is launched as shown. The distance <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math> is measured from right end of the bar when it is launched to the left end of the bar when it lands. During flight, the object experiences some rotation about its center of mass. Which of the following initial and final orientations of the bar’s center of mass <math alttext=\"x sub c m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>x</mi><mtext>cm</mtext></msub></math> would maximize <math alttext=\"d\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>d</mi></math>?",
