    "question": "A box slides up a short, inclined ramp and continues to travel beyond the ramp. Friction and air resistance are negligible. Point <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> is located on the ramp and Point <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> is located at the maximum height of the box’s path, as shown. Which of the following best represents the free-body diagrams of the block at each location?",
