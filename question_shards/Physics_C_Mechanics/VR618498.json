    "question": "A large box of mass <math alttext=\"uppercase M\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>M</mi></math> is at rest on a platform of mass <math alttext=\"lowercase m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>m</mi></math>, where <math alttext=\"uppercase M is greater than lowercase m\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>M</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi>m</mi></math>. These objects are suspended by two strings and each string passes over a separate pulley attached to the ceiling, as shown. Which of the following correctly states the number of upward forces acting on the box-platform system and provides the correct justification?",
