    "question": "An object is moving while a constant force is exerted on it. Could the addition of a force of the same magnitude cause the object to move with a constant velocity? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, an additional force could cause the object to move with a constant velocity, if the additional force is perpendicular to the single force, because the two forces exerted on the object would be balanced.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, an additional force could cause the object to move with a constant velocity, if the additional force is opposite to the single force, because the two forces exerted on the object would be balanced.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, an additional force could not cause the object to move with a constant velocity, because the object is already in motion, therefore, any additional force will cause the object to either increase or decrease its velocity.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, an additional force could not cause the object to move with a constant velocity, because the object is already in motion, and any additional force will cause the object to change its direction while maintaining the speed the object had before the additional force.",
