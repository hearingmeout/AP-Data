    "question": "Some students attach a single spring to a clamp and let the spring hang vertically. Objects of different mass are attached to the free end of the spring and allowed to hang at rest. The students measure the distance <math alttext=\"delta y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>y</mi></math> the spring stretches from its equilibrium length for each object. The students produce the graph of <math alttext=\"delta y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>y</mi></math> as a function of the weight <math alttext=\"F sub g\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math> of the objects shown in the figure, and the slope of the best-fit line to the data is determined to be <math alttext=\"S sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>S</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>. Next, the students take a second spring that is identical to the first and arrange the two springs as shown in the two-spring arrangement next to the graph. Once again, objects of different mass are attached to the two-spring arrangement, <math alttext=\"delta y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>y</mi></math> is measured, and the data is plotted on another graph showing <math alttext=\"delta y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>y</mi></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"F sub g\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></math>. Which of the following best describes the slope of the best-fit line to the data collected for the two-spring arrangement and gives correct supporting reasoning for the claim?",
