    "question": "An object is released from rest and falls to the ground near Earth’s surface. The resistive force exerted on the object is directly proportional to the speed of the object which results in a velocity function which includes the term <math alttext=\"e raised to the negative t over beta, end power\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>β</mi></mrow></msup></math>, where <math alttext=\"beta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>β</mi></math> is a positive constant . Which of the following statements best describes the motion of the object if it falls for a time equal to <math alttext=\"beta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>β</mi></math>?",

        "label": "The object will reach its terminal velocity at time <math alttext=\"t equals beta\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>β</mi></math>, because at this time the weight of the object equals the resistive force.",
