    "description": "",
    "question": "A block released from rest slides down a rough incline where there is noticeable friction between the block and the incline. At the bottom of the incline, the block slides off the table and then continues to move as a projectile. Which of the following defines a system, and correctly justifies the change of mechanical energy in that system from when the block is released to just before the block lands on the ground?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "In the block only system, the total energy increases because the net work done on the box is greater than zero.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "In the block only system, the total energy remains constant because energy is dissipated by friction.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "In the block-Earth system, the total energy increases because the force of gravity does more work on the block than is dissipated by the force of friction exerted on the block.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "In the block-Earth system, the total energy remains constant because energy is always conserved.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "In the block only system, the total energy increases because the net work done on the box is greater than zero."
