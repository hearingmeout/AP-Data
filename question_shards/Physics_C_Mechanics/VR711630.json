    "description": "A wheel is free to rotate with negligible friction about a fixed axle at its center. In separate experimental trials, different pieces of clay are launched toward the wheel’s rim, and each piece of clay collides with and sticks to the outer rim of the wheel, as shown in the figure. The wheel has a mass <math alttext=\"m sub w, equals 0.080 kilograms\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>W</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.080</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>kg</mtext></mstyle></math>, a radius <math alttext=\"r sub w, equals 0.40 meters\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>r</mi><mtext>W</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.40</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mtext>m</mtext></mstyle></math>, and rotational inertia about its center <math alttext=\"I sub w equals, m sub w, end sub, r sub w, end sub, squared\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>I</mi><mtext>W</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mtext>W</mtext></msub><msup><msub><mi>r</mi><mtext>W</mtext></msub><mn>2</mn></msup></mstyle></math>.

    "question": "In a second experimental trial, the wheel is initially rotating counterclockwise.
