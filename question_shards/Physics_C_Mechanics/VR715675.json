    "question": "A disk is spinning about its center at a constant, clockwise angular velocity <math alttext=\"omega\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ω</mi></math>. After an external torque is exerted on the disk, the disk spins at a constant, counterclockwise angular velocity <math alttext=\"negative omega\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mi>ω</mi></math>. Which of the following claims is true about the rotational kinetic energy of the disk?",
