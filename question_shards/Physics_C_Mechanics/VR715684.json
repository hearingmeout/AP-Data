    "question": "A spinning disk is brought to rest by a constant torque. The disk undergoes ten complete rotations before coming to rest. How does the magnitude of the change in the kinetic energy of the disk during the first five rotations compare to the magnitude of the change in the kinetic energy of the disk during the last five rotations?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "It is greater during the first five rotations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is greater during the last five rotations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "It is the same during the first five and last five rotations.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The kinetic energy transfer cannot be compared without knowing the rotational inertia and initial angular speed of the disk.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "It is the same during the first five and last five rotations."
