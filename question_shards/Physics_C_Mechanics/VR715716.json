    "question": "A sphere is held at the top of a straight ramp. When released, the sphere rolls down the ramp without slipping. Which of the following claims about the force of friction, if any, is correct?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There is a nonzero force of static friction exerted on the sphere that increases in magnitude as the rotation of the sphere increases.",

      {
        "label": "There is a nonzero force of static friction exerted on the sphere that does not dissipate any mechanical energy.",

      {
        "label": "There is a nonzero force of kinetic friction exerted on the sphere because the sphere is moving.",

        "label": "There is a nonzero force of kinetic friction exerted on the sphere that dissipates mechanical energy.",
