    "question": "A merry-go-round on a playground consists of a large, horizontal disk that can rotate about a vertical axis through its center. The disk is initially at rest and is given an angular acceleration <math alttext=\"alpha \" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>α</mi></math> that varies with time <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> according to the equation <math alttext=\"alpha equals C t minus D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>C</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>D</mi></math>, where <math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>C</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>D</mi></math> are positive constants with appropriate units and the positive direction is taken to be clockwise. Which of the following statements is true about the angular velocity of the merry-go-round at time <math alttext=\"t equals the fraction D over C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>D</mi><mi>C</mi></mfrac></math> ?",
