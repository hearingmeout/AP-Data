    "question": "An initially hollow cube is crushed with enough force to make it into a solid cube. For a rotation axis that runs through the center of the cube and the centers of two opposite faces of the cube, which of the following is true about the rotational inertia for the solid cube compared to the original hollow cube?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The rotational inertia is the same before and after the cube is crushed.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The rotational inertia is greater for the solid cube.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The rotational inertia is less for the solid cube.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The rotational inertia cannot be compared without knowing the mass and size of the cube.",

    "answer": "The rotational inertia is less for the solid cube."
