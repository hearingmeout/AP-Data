    "question": "A horizontal disk is free to rotate about a vertical axis through its center. The disk is rotating with a constant angular velocity in the positive direction when, starting at time zero, a torque is exerted on the disk, resulting in the motion shown in the graph of angular velocity as a function of time. Which of the following statements describes what happens to the magnitude of the net torque on the disk for times greater than zero, and provides reasoning to support the claim?",
