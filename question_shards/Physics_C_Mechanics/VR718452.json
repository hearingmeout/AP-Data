    "question": "There are two pulleys, each with a fixed rotation axis at its center and a string wrapped around it, as shown in the figures. In separate experimental trials, the pulley string on one of the pulleys is pulled downward with a constant force and the angular acceleration of the pulley is determined. The rotational inertia is the same for both pulleys, even though the radius is larger for the pulley in Trial <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. Is the angular acceleration the same or different in the two trials? What reasoning supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The same. The force exerted on and the rotational inertia of each pulley is the same.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The same. The larger-radius pulley also has a smaller mass, which cancels the effect of the larger radius.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Different. A larger pulley radius results in a greater torque for a given force.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Different. The larger-radius pulley spins more slowly for a given linear speed of the string.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Different. A larger pulley radius results in a greater torque for a given force."
