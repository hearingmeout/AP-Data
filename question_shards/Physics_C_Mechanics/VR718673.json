    "question": "A system consists of several interacting objects. One of the objects, Object O, is free to move only in the <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">x</mi></math>-direction under the influence of only conservative forces, while the other objects are fixed in place. The potential energy of the system as a function of Object O’s position is <math alttext=\"U of x equals, k x raised to the fourth power\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>4</mn></msup></math>, where <math alttext=\"k\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>k</mi></math> is a positive constant. Can the motion of Object O be described as simple harmonic motion? Why or why not?",
