    "question": "A spring is attached to a fixed vertical wall and extends over a horizontal surface, as shown in the figure labeled “No Box.” In an experimental trial, a box is attached to and pushed against the spring, which has a spring constant <math alttext=\"k sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mstyle></math>, compressing the spring an amount <math alttext=\"D sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> from its uncompressed length. The box is then released from rest and oscillates about its equilibrium position, with a maximum speed of <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>. In a second trial, a spring with spring constant <math alttext=\"2 k sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> and the same uncompressed length is used. The same box is attached to and pushed against the new spring, compressing it an amount <math alttext=\"the fraction D sub 0 over 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> from its uncompressed length. The box is released from rest and oscillates about its equilibrium position, with a maximum speed of <math alttext=\"v sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>. There is negligible friction between the block and the surface. Are speeds <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> and <math alttext=\"v sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> equal? What reasoning can be used to support the claim?",
