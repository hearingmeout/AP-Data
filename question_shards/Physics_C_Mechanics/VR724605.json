    "question": "Two blocks, <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>, are at rest on a horizontal surface. A spring is attached to Block <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math> and is compressed when the blocks are held together, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. The blocks are then simultaneously released and move in opposite directions along the surface with negligible friction as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>. Which of the following correctly indicates how the total kinetic energy and total momentum of the spring-two-cart system change as the blocks move away from each other just after they are released compared to these quantities before they are released?\nTotal Kinetic EnergyTotal MomentumAIncreasesStays the sameBIncreasesIncreasesCStays the sameStays the sameDStays the sameIncreases",
