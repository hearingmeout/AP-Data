    "question": "A straight tunnel is drilled through the Earth as shown in the figure. A cart inside the tunnel is free to move with negligible friction. Which of the following claims is correct regarding an equilibrium position for the cart and the net force exerted on the cart while inside the tunnel?",

      {
        "label": "There is an equilibrium position within the tunnel, and the net force is a restoring force.",
