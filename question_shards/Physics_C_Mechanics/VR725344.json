    "question": "A small ball is initially at rest at the top of a smooth curved hill. The hill’s surface is in the shape of a parabola. If the ball is rolled down the hill, is the <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math>-component of its motion an example of simple harmonic motion? What reasoning supports the claim?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes. The initial push on the ball displaces it from the equilibrium position.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "Yes. The potential energy of the ball-Earth system is a quadratic function of position, resulting in a linear restoring force.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No. There is no equilibrium position for the ball.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No. The net force on the ball is in the same direction as the ball’s displacement from equilibrium.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "No. The net force on the ball is in the same direction as the ball’s displacement from equilibrium."
