    "question": "Block <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> of mass <math alttext=\"m sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> is on a horizontal surface and is attached to one end of a spring. The other end of the spring is fixed in place. Block <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> is displaced to the right of its equilibrium position, released from rest, and then oscillates with negligible friction on the horizontal surface. The resulting graph of the block’s displacement as a function of time is shown in the figure. Block <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> is then replaced with Block <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> of mass <math alttext=\"m sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>, where <math alttext=\"m sub 2 is greater than m sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>. Block <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> is displaced the same amount to the right of equilibrium that Block <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> was, released from rest, and oscillates with negligible friction on the horizontal surface. Which of the choices shows a solid curve for the displacement graph of Block <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math>? The displacement graph of Block <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> is shown as a dotted curve for reference.",
