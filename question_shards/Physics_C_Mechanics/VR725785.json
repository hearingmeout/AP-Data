    "question": "A metal sphere is hung vertically from the bottom of a spring, and the top end of the spring is attached to the ceiling inside a car. When the car is stationary, the frequency of oscillation for the sphere-spring system is <math alttext=\"f sub 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>. How does the oscillation frequency change, if at all, when the car starts moving forward along a horizontal road with a constant acceleration? Assume the frequency is measured by an observer at rest with respect to the road in both situations.",
