    "question": "A small rock moves vertically inside a tunnel through a spherical moon that has a uniform density and no atmosphere, as shown in the figure. Inside the tunnel the gravitational force on the rock is proportional to its distance from the moon’s center, and the rock undergoes simple harmonic motion after being released from rest at the moon’s surface. The rock’s kinetic energy is <math alttext=\"K sub C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>K</mi><mtext>C</mtext></msub></math> when it is passing through the center of the moon. When the rock’s kinetic energy is <math alttext=\"two thirds K sub C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><msub><mi>K</mi><mtext>C</mtext></msub></math>, is the rock closer to the surface or closer to the center of the moon? What evidence supports the claim?",
