    "question": "A physical pendulum is made from a uniform bar with a pivot at its top end. A second physical pendulum is made from another uniform bar of twice the length, also with a pivot at its top end. How does the small-angle oscillation period of the second pendulum compare to that of the first? The rotational inertia about one end for a bar of mass <math alttext=\"uppercase M\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>M</mi></math> and length <math alttext=\"L\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>L</mi></math> is <math alttext=\"one third uppercase M L squared\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mi>M</mi><msup><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>.",
