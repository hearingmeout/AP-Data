    "question": "A lab cart is traveling along a straight, horizontal track with an unknown initial velocity. The graph shows the net force on the cart as a function of time during a short time interval. Does the graph provide sufficient information to determine the change in momentum of the cart during the time interval shown, and what evidence supports the claim?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the change in momentum is equal to the area under the curve of the force-versus-time graph.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the change in momentum is equal to the slope of the force-versus-time graph.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the initial momentum is unknown and therefore the change in momentum cannot be determined.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the force is not constant and therefore the change in momentum cannot be determined.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because the change in momentum is equal to the area under the curve of the force-versus-time graph."
