    "question": "Students perform an experiment with multiple trials using blocks that can slide with negligible friction on a straight, horizontal track. In each trial, a block of mass <math alttext=\"m sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> slides with speed <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> on the track and collides with a stationary block of mass <math alttext=\"m sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>. The blocks stick together and move with speed <math alttext=\"v sub f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></math> after the collision. In each trial, <math alttext=\"m sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> and <math alttext=\"v sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> are kept constant but the mass <math alttext=\"m sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> of the stationary block is varied, and <math alttext=\"v sub f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></math> is recorded. The students graph <math alttext=\"v sub f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></math> as a function of <math alttext=\"m sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>. Which of the following could represent a best-fit curve to the data collected by the students?",
