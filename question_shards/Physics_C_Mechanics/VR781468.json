There is nonnegligible friction between the block and the horizontal surface. The diagram shows the position of the block at <math alttext=\"0.5 second\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.5</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi></math> time intervals.",
    "question": "Which of the following provides a velocity-time graph that could correspond to the diagram and provides correct reasoning?\n\nVelocity-Time Graph\n Reasoning\n\nA\n\nThe distance traveled by the block during each half-second interval increases, so the velocity of the block must increase.\n\nB\n\nThe block is traveling in the positive <math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math>-direction, so the velocity graph must have a positive slope.\n\nC\n\nThe force of friction exerted on the block causes the acceleration of the block to decrease.\n\nD\n\nThe block reaches a constant speed.",
