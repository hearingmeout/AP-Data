The figures show the sphere and the frame at three different times.\n\nFigure <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> shows when the pendulum is at its maximum leftward displacement.\n\nFigure <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> shows when the pendulum is instantaneously at its equilibrium position.\n\nFigure <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math> shows when the pendulum is at its maximum rightward displacement.",
