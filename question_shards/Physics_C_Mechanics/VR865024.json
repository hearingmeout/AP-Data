Starting at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>t</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0</mn> </math>, the horizontal position of the cart along the track is marked at regular intervals of time, as shown in Figure <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>. The only forces that are exerted on the cart are from the track and Earth. Friction between the cart and the track is negligible.",
