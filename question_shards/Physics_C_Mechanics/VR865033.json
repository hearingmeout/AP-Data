    "description": "A block is connected by a string to a sphere. The block is on a ramp inclined at an angle of <math alttext=\"30 degrees\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mn>30</mn> <mo>°</mo> </math> to the horizontal, as shown. The string passes over a pulley of negligible mass and friction, and the sphere hangs freely. The block accelerates down the ramp with negligible friction.",
