    "question": "A time-varying counterclockwise torque is applied to the outer edge of a platform that is initially rotating clockwise about its center. The torque continuously increases in magnitude from an initial value of zero. The platform comes to a stop after <math alttext=\"5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> rotations, at which time the torque is removed. How does the decrease in the rotational kinetic energy of the platform during the first rotation compare to the decrease in rotational kinetic energy during the final rotation?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy decreases more during the first rotation.",

      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy decreases more during the last rotation.",
        "image": null

      {
        "label": "The rotational kinetic energy decreases by the same amount during the first and the last rotation.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The decrease in rotational kinetic energy cannot be compared without knowing whether the torque increases at a greater rate during the first or the last rotation",
