    "question": "A cart is moving to the right with a constant speed of 20 m s. A box of mass 80 kg moves with the cart without slipping. The coefficient of static friction between the box and cart is 0.30, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and cart is 0.15. What are the magnitude and direction of the frictional force acting on the box as it moves with the cart?",
