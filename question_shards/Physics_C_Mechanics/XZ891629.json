    "question": "A satellite is in a counterclockwise elliptical orbit around a planet, as shown in the figure. The satellite is shown at two positions along its orbit, Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> and Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>. As the satellite moves from Point <math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>A</mtext></math> to Point <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>B</mtext></math>, what happens to the angular momentum of the satellite about the planet, and what reasoning supports the claim?",
