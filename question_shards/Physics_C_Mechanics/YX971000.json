    "question": "A block is hung vertically from an ideal spring. The block is pulled down, released, and allowed to oscillate. The vertical position <math alttext=\"y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>y</mi></math> of the block as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math> is shown in the graph.
