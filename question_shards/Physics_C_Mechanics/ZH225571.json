    "question": "An object falling near Earth’s surface has two forces exerted on it: the gravitational force and a resistive force <math alttext=\"F sub R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mtext>R</mtext></msub></math> that is proportional to the object’s velocity <math alttext=\"v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>v</mi></math> as <math alttext=\"F sub R, equals negative k v\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>F</mi><mtext>R</mtext></msub><mo> </mo><mo>=</mo><mo> </mo><mo>-</mo><mi>k</mi><mi>v</mi></math>, where <math alttext=\"k\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>k</mi></math> is a positive constant. Does the acceleration of the object depend on its mass? Why or why not?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "No, because the acceleration is constant and equal to <math alttext=\"g\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>g</mi></math>.",

      {
        "label": "No, because the terminal velocity of the object increases as its mass increases.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because Newton’s second law indicates that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the weight of the object is proportional to its mass, while the resistive force is independent of its mass.",
