    "question": "A small solid sphere is released from rest at the top of an inclined plane as shown. The sphere rolls down without slipping and reaches the bottom of the plane. How would the angular momentum of the sphere at the bottom of the plane change if the coefficient of static friction between the sphere and the plane were increased?",
