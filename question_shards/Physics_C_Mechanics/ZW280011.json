    "question": "Figure 1 shows a block oscillating on a spring. The block is to the right of its equilibrium position <math alttext=\"x equals 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> and moving to the right. The two vectors indicate the spring force <math alttext=\"vector uppercase F sub s\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> and the frictional force <math alttext=\"vector lowercase f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow></mover></mrow></mstyle></math>acting on the block at that point. Figure 2 shows the block after it has reached its maximum displacement and returned to the same point. Which of the following indicates features in the figures that support claims as to where the spring force and friction are conservative forces?",
