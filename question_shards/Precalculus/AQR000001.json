    "question": "Residual Plot for f: The horizontal axis is labeled x. No values are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Residuals. It ranges from negative 1.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.5. 7 points are plotted. The 7 points are equally spaced relative to the horizontal axis. From left to right, the approximate Residuals values of the 7 plotted points are as follows: negative 0.7 0.4 0.41 0.42 negative 0.55 0.5 negative 0.48 Residual Plot for g: The horizontal axis is labeled x. No values are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Residuals. It ranges from negative 6 to 6 in increments of 1. 7 points are plotted. The 7 points are equally spaced relative to the horizontal axis. From left to right, the approximate Residuals values of the 7 plotted points are as follows: negative 5 negative 0.2 2.5 5.1 2.9 negative 0.5 negative 4.8 Two regression models <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> are constructed from a data set. The residual plots for both models are shown. Which of the following statements is true?",
