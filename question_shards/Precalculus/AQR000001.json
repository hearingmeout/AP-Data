It ranges from negative 1.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.5.\n\n7 points are plotted. \n\nThe 7 points are equally spaced relative to the horizontal axis.\n\nFrom left to right, the approximate Residuals values of the 7 plotted points are as follows: \n\nnegative 0.7 \n\n0.4\n\n0.41\n\n0.42\n\nnegative 0.55\n\n0.5\n\nnegative 0.48\n\nResidual Plot for g:\n\nThe horizontal axis is labeled x. No values are indicated.\n\nThe vertical axis is labeled Residuals. It ranges from negative 6 to 6 in increments of 1.\n\n7 points are plotted. \n\nThe 7 points are equally spaced relative to the horizontal axis.\n\nFrom left to right, the approximate Residuals values of the 7 plotted points are as follows:\n\nnegative 5\n\nnegative 0.2\n\n2.5\n\n5.1\n\n2.9\n\nnegative 0.5\n\nnegative 4.8\n\nTwo regression models <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> are constructed from a data set.
