    "question": "For the curve: Moving from left to right: The curve begins at the point (0 comma 0). The curve then rises sharply and ends at the approximate point (1.25 comma 90). The curve passes through the following points: (0 comma 0) approximately (1 comma 60) approximately (1.25 comma 90) For the line segment: The line segment slants gradually up from left to right. The line segment begins where the curve ends, at the approximate point (1.25 comma 90). The line segment ends at the approximate point (3 comma 120). A car is traveling on a straight road. A graph of the car’s position, in miles, from its starting point at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> hours on a particular day is shown. Which of the following is true about the car’s position for <math alttext=\"0 less or equal than t less or equal than 3\"><mn>0</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>3</mn></math> hours?",
