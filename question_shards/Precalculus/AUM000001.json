    "question": "For the curve:\n\nMoving from left to right:\n\nThe curve begins at the point (0 comma 0).\n\nThe curve then rises sharply and ends at the approximate point (1.25 comma 90). \n\nThe curve passes through the following points:\n\n(0 comma 0)\n\napproximately (1 comma 60)\n\napproximately (1.25 comma 90)\n\nFor the line segment: \n\nThe line segment slants gradually up from left to right. \n\nThe line segment begins where the curve ends, at the approximate point (1.25 comma 90).\n\nThe line segment ends at the approximate point (3 comma 120).\n\nA car is traveling on a straight road. A graph of the car’s position, in miles, from its starting point at time <math alttext=\"t equals 0\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> hours on a particular day is shown. Which of the following is true about the car’s position for <math alttext=\"0 less or equal than t less or equal than 3\"><mn>0</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>3</mn></math> hours?",
