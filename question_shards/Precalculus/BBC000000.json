    "description": "The figure shows a swimming pool filled with water. A pump is used to remove water from the pool until the pool is empty. When the pump is running, the rate at which the volume of water in the pool decreases is constant. During the first two hours, the pump works slower than usual due to a broken piece. Then the pump stops working. The broken piece is replaced, and the pump works at its usual rate until the pool is completely emptied of water. The entire process of emptying the pool takes six hours.",
    "question": "Which of the following graphs could depict this situation, where time, in hours, is the independent variable, and the volume of water in the pool, in gallons, is the dependent variable?",
