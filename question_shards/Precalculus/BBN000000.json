    "question": "​A student starts to drive to school from home in a straight line and quickly realizes they forgot their backpack. The student stops the car and then drives back to their starting position at home. For this context, which of the following graphs could model the velocity <math alttext=\"v\"><mi>v</mi></math>, in miles per hour, of the car as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\"><mi>t</mi></math>, in hours? (Assume driving away from home involves positive velocity.)",

The section of the curve from the origin to the high point and back to the horizontal axis appears to be symmetric about the vertical line through the high point. The curve continues to decrease to a low point below the horizontal axis. The high point and low point appear to be the same distance from the horizontal axis. The curve increases from the low point to the horizontal axis, where it ends. The section of the curve from the point at which it crosses the horizontal axis, reaches the low point, and returns to the horizontal axis appears to be symmetric about the vertical line through the low point. The point at which the curve crosses the horizontal axis appears to be halfway between the beginning point at the origin and the ending point on the far side of the horizontal axis.",
