    "question": "​A student starts to drive to school from home in a straight line and quickly realizes they forgot their backpack. The student stops the car and then drives back to their starting position at home. For this context, which of the following graphs could model the velocity <math alttext=\"v\"><mi>v</mi></math>, in miles per hour, of the car as a function of time <math alttext=\"t\"><mi>t</mi></math>, in hours? (Assume driving away from home involves positive velocity.)",
