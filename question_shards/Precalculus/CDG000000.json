    "question": "​A certain type of machine produces a number of amps of electricity that follows a cyclic, periodically increasing and decreasing pattern. The machine produces a maximum of  <math alttext=\"7\"><semantics><mn>7</mn><annotation encoding=\"application/vnd.wiris.mtweb-params+json\">{\"digitSeparatorsAsMN\":\"auto\"}</annotation></semantics></math> amps at certain times and a minimum of <math alttext=\"2\"><semantics><mn>2</mn><annotation encoding=\"application/vnd.wiris.mtweb-params+json\">{\"digitSeparatorsAsMN\":\"auto\"}</annotation></semantics></math> amps at other times. It takes about <math alttext=\"5\"><semantics><mn>5</mn><annotation encoding=\"application/vnd.wiris.mtweb-params+json\">{\"digitSeparatorsAsMN\":\"auto\"}</annotation></semantics></math> minutes for one cycle from <math alttext=\"7\"><semantics><mn>7</mn><annotation encoding=\"application/vnd.wiris.mtweb-params+json\">{\"digitSeparatorsAsMN\":\"auto\"}</annotation></semantics></math> amps to the next <math alttext=\"7\"><semantics><mn>7</mn><annotation encoding=\"application/vnd.wiris.mtweb-params+json\">{\"digitSeparatorsAsMN\":\"auto\"}</annotation></semantics></math> amps to occur. Which of the following graphs models amps as a function of time, in minutes, for this machine?",
