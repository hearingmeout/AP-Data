    "question": "The x axis ranges from negative 3 to 6 in increments of 1. The y axis ranges from negative 5 to 13 in increments of 1. Moving from left to right:\n\nThe curve enters the window at approximately (negative 2.2 comma 13.5).\n\nThe curve decreases sharply then levels off reaching a low point at the origin.\n\nThe curve then gradually increases to reach its steepest point at the labeled point (2 comma sixteen thirds). \n\nThe curve then increases, gradually leveling off to approximately (4 comma 10.8), increasing less and less as it continues.\n\nThe curve then gradually decreases from the high point at (4 comma 10.8) to cross the x axis at (6 comma 0) and exit the window at approximately (6.3 comma negative 5) where it is steepest.\n\n​The graph of the function <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> is given for <math alttext=\"negative 3 less or equal than x less or equal than 6\"><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>6</mn></math>.
