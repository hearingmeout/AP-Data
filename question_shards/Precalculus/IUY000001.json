    "question": "The plot has 6 data points. The data points are in the pattern of a curve that trends up first gradually and then sharply from left to right. The data points have the following approximate coordinates: (1 comma 6) (2 comma 9) (3 comma 30) (4 comma 260) (5 comma 3,100) (6 comma 46,600) The plot has 6 data points. The data points are in the pattern of a curve that trends up first sharply and then gradually from left to right. The data points have the following approximate coordinates: (1 comma 6) (5 comma 30) (10 comma 105) (25 comma 630) (50 comma 2,500) (100 comma 10,000) The plot has 12 data points. The data points are in a symmetrical pattern: The data points are first in a linear pattern trending down from left to right. The data points are then in a linear pattern trending up from left to right. The data points have the following approximate coordinates: (negative 100 comma 290 million) (negative 50 comma 31,850) (negative 25 comma 334) (negative 10 comma 22) (negative 5 comma 9) (negative 1 comma 4) (1 comma 4) (5 comma 9) (10 comma 22) (25 comma 334) (50 comma 31,850) (100 comma 290 million) The plot has 6 data points. The data points are in a linear pattern trending up from left to right. The data have the following approximate coordinates: (1 comma 4) (5 comma 9) (10 comma 22) (25 comma 334) (50 comma 31,850) (100 comma 290 million) A data set is modeled by an exponential function of the form <math alttext=\"g open parentheses x close parentheses equals a b to the power of x\"><mi>g</mi><mfenced><mi>x</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>b</mi><mi>x</mi></msup></math>, where <math alttext=\"a greater than 0\"><mi>a</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"b greater than 1\"><mi>b</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></math>. A semi-log plot of the data set is constructed. If <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> is an appropriate model, which of the following could be a semi-log plot of the data?",
