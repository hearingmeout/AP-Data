    "question": "​A metronome is a practice tool that produces a steady beat to help musicians play rhythms accurately. Some metronomes use a pendulum that repeatedly swings left and right to produce the steady beat. Which of the following is true about the beat produced by the metronome and the motion of the pendulum?",
