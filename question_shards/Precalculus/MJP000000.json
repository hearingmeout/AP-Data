    "question": "The horizontal axis is labeled t and represents Time (hours). The vertical axis is labeled C and represents Percent Charge. Neither axis shows tick marks or a scale. The curve begins on the vertical axis. The curve decreases sharply. The curve then transitions to a shallow decrease over a similar length time interval. The curve then decreases sharply again over a similar length time interval. The curve then transitions to a shallow decrease until reaching the horizontal axis. ​The graph of a function models the percentage of charge <math alttext=\"C\"><mi>C</mi></math> in a phone battery over a period of time <math alttext=\"t\"><mi>t</mi></math>, in hours. Based on the graph, which of the following collections of statements about the function and scenario is accurate?",
