    "question": "The curve enters the window at (negative 3.7 comma 5.5). The curve decreases to reach a low point at (negative 3 comma 0). The curve then increases, passing through (negative 2 comma 4), to reach a high point at (negative 1.8 comma 4.5). The curve then decreases, passing through (negative 1 comma 2), to reach a low point at the origin. The curve then increases, passing through (1 comma 1) to reach a high point at (1.2 comma 1.1). The curve then decreases to cross the x axis at (2 comma 0) and reaches a low point at (2.6 comma negative 0.6). The curve then increases, passing through (3 comma negative 0.3) to cross the x axis at (3.1 comma 0) and reaches a high point at (3.6 comma 0.7). The curve then decreases to cross the x axis at (4 comma 0) and exits the window at (4.5 comma negative 4.5). ​The graph of the function <math alttext=\"y equals g open parentheses x close parentheses\"><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>g</mi><mfenced><mi>x</mi></mfenced></math> is given.
