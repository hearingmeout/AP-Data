    "question": "The line begins at the origin.\n\nAs x increases, the line slants gradually up.\n\nThe curve has approximately the shape of a parabola that opens upward.\n\nThe curve begins at the origin.\n\nAs x increases, the curve trends up gradually then sharply.\n\nThe curve has approximately the shape of a parabola that opens to the right.\n\nThe curve begins at the origin.\n\nAs x increases, the curve trends up sharply then gradually.\n\nThe curve has approximately the shape of an S.\n\nThe curve begins at the origin.\n\nAs x increases, the curve trends up gradually, then sharply, then gradually.\n\nThe figure shows a container in the shape of a circular cone. The container is being filled with water at a constant rate until the container is completely full. Which of the following could be the graph that models the dependent variable of depth of the water, in centimeters, as a function of the independent variable of time, in hours?",
