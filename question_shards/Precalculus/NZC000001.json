    "question": "The line begins at the origin. As x increases, the line slants gradually up. The curve has approximately the shape of a parabola that opens upward. The curve begins at the origin. As x increases, the curve trends up gradually then sharply. The curve has approximately the shape of a parabola that opens to the right. The curve begins at the origin. As x increases, the curve trends up sharply then gradually. The curve has approximately the shape of an S. The curve begins at the origin. As x increases, the curve trends up gradually, then sharply, then gradually. The figure shows a container in the shape of a circular cone. The container is being filled with water at a constant rate until the container is completely full. Which of the following could be the graph that models the dependent variable of depth of the water, in centimeters, as a function of the independent variable of time, in hours?",
