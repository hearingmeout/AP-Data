    "question": "​Researchers are developing a mathematical function model <math alttext=\"H\"><mi>H</mi></math> to estimate the height of any tree, in meters, based on the tree’s circumference <math alttext=\"c\"><mi>c</mi></math>, in meters, as measured at a height of one meter from base of the tree. Which of the following statements is an assumption about what is consistent in this context?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "​Because the model applies to trees in general, trees should simultaneously grow in circumference and height across different tree species.",

        "label": "​Because the model should be used across different geographical environments, the domain of the function is limited by environmental factors.",
