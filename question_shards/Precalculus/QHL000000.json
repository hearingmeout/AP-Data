    "description": "The stage is shown at the top left. Three squares indicate the sizes of three square-shaped field. The three squares are nested from smallest to largest, share a point in the top left corner, and share a portion of the top of the square and the left side of the square. The smallest square has a horizontal side labeled Small Field. The square that is larger has a horizontal side labeled Medium Field. The largest square has a horizontal side labeled Large Field.",
    "question": "​A music agent is planning a series of concerts at local farms around the nation. The agent is building a model to estimate crowd capacity based on different sizes of square fields. Which type of function is most likely to model crowd capacity in this situation?",
