    "question": "The curve enters the window at (negative 1.5 comma negative 3.5). The curve increases to reach a high point at (negative 1 comma 0). The curve decreases to reach a low point at (negative 0.4 comma negative 0.8). The curve increases to pass through the origin and reach a high point at (1 comma 3.2). The curve decreases to cross the x axis at (2 comma 0) and reach a low point at (2.4 comma negative 0.8). The curve increases to reach a high point at (3 comma 0). The curve decreases to exit the window at (3.5 comma negative 3.5). The curve appears to be symmetric about the vertical line x = 1. ​The graph of the polynomial function <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> is shown. The function <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> is defined for <math alttext=\"0 less or equal than x less or equal than 3\"><mn>0</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>3</mn></math> and is identical to the function <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> on that interval. How many total local minima and local maxima does the function <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> have?",
