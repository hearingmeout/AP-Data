The second loop is symmetric over the positive y axis. It runs from the origin, up to the left, then up to the right to (r comma theta) equals (2 comma pi over 2). The loop continues down to the right, then down to the left back to the origin. The third loop is symmetric over the negative x axis. It runs from the origin, up to the left, then down to the left to (r comma theta) equals (2 comma pi). The loop continues down to the right, then up to the right back to the origin. The fourth loop is symmetric over the negative y axis. It runs from the origin, down to the left, then down to the right to (r comma theta) equals (2 comma 3 pi over 2).
