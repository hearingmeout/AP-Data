    "description": "The figure is labeled \"Graph of g\". First and second quadrants are shown. No scale is indicated, but assuming that each grid line represents one unit, the x axis ranges from negative 5 to 4 in increments of 1. The y axis ranges from 0 to 4 in increments of 1.\n\nAll coordinates are approximate. Moving from left to right:\n\nThe curve enters the window at (negative 5.2 comma 1.9).\n\nThe curve increases to reach a relative maximum at (negative 2.8 comma 4). This point is labeled A.\n\nThe curve decreases to pass through point B at (negative 1.7 comma 3.7).\n\nThe curve continues to decrease to point C at (negative 0.2 comma 2.8).\n\nThe curve continues to decrease but at a lesser and lesser rate to reach a relative minimum at (2.4 comma 1.5).\n\nThe curve increases to pass through (3 comma 1.6). This point is labeled D.\n\nThe curve continues to increase until it exits the window at (4.3 comma 2.8).\n\nThe figure shows the graph of a function <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> in the <math alttext=\"x y\"> <mi>x</mi> <mi>y</mi> </math>-plane with four labeled points. It is known that a relative maximum of <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> occurs at <math alttext=\"A\"><mi>A</mi></math>, and the only point of inflection of the graph of <math alttext=\"g\"><mi>g</mi></math> is <math alttext=\"C\"><mi>C</mi></math>.",
