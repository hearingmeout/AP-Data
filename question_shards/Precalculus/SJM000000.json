    "question": "The toy car is traveling along a dashed circle. The car is located at the top right of the circle and oriented facing the clockwise direction. The center of the circle is indicated with a point. A point directly to the right of the center and located on the circle is marked and labeled with Start Point. A vertical rectangle is labeled Wall and its left edge is tangent to the circle, intersecting it at the point labeled Start Point. ​A toy car travels around a circular track as shown in the figure. As the toy car travels around the track, its distance from the wall can be modeled by a graph where the <math alttext=\"y\"><mi>y</mi></math>-axis represents the distance between the car and the wall, and the <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi></math>-axis represents time. Which of the following graphs models this relationship as the car goes around the track three times without stopping?",

The curve increases to a high point, decreases back through the horizontal axis to a low point, increases back through the horizontal axis to a high point, and then decreases to end on the horizontal axis. The high and low points are the same distance from the horizontal axis. Each section of the curve from the horizontal axis to a high or low point and back to the horizontal axis is symmetric about the vertical line through the high or low point, and all three sections appear to span the same horizontal length.",
