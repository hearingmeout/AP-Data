    "question": "The toy car is traveling along a dashed circle. The car is located at the top right of the circle and oriented facing the clockwise direction. \n\nThe center of the circle is indicated with a point. A point directly to the right of the center and located on the circle is marked and labeled with Start Point.\n\nA vertical rectangle is labeled Wall and its left edge is tangent to the circle, intersecting it at the point labeled Start Point.\n\n​A toy car travels around a circular track as shown in the figure. As the toy car travels around the track, its distance from the wall can be modeled by a graph where the <math alttext=\"y\"><mi>y</mi></math>-axis represents the distance between the car and the wall, and the <math alttext=\"x\"><mi>x</mi></math>-axis represents time. Which of the following graphs models this relationship as the car goes around the track three times without stopping?",
