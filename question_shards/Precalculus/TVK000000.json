    "question": "The x axis ranges from 0 to 9 in increments of 1. The y axis is labeled Residuals and ranges from negative 4.5 to 4.5 in increments of 0.5. The 8 plotted points have the following approximate coordinates:\n\n(1 comma negative 3.1)\n\n(2 comma 1.5)\n\n(3 comma 4)\n\n(4 comma 2.4)\n\n(5 comma negative 2.3)\n\n(6 comma negative 4)\n\n(7 comma negative 1.8)\n\n(8 comma 3.3)\n\n​\n​Students in a science class are constructing a model for a data set. The residual plot for their quadratic regression model is given. Which of the following is the best conclusion?",
