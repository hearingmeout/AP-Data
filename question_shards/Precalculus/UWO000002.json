    "question": "The horizontal axis is labeled First Day of Month.\n\nIt starts at January and shows a tick mark and gridline for each month, ending at January again\n\nThe vertical axis is labeled Temperature (degrees Celsius) and ranges from 10 to 25 in increments of 1.\n\nAll coordinates are approximate.\n\nMoving from left to right, the smooth curve passes through the following points:\n\n(January comma 13.6)\n\n(February comma 13)\n\n(March comma 13.7)\n\n(April comma 15.5)\n\n(May comma 18)\n\n(June comma 20.5)\n\n(July comma 22.3)\n\n(August comma 23)\n\n(September comma 22.3)\n\n(October comma 20.5)\n\n(November comma 18)\n\n(December comma 15.5)\n\n(January comma 13.6)\n\n​The daily high temperature at a certain point in a river is modeled by the graph. Each point on a vertical gridline indicates the temperature, in degrees Celsius, on the first day of the indicated month. Of the following, on the first day of which month is the rate of change of the temperature the greatest?",
