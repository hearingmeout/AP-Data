    "question": "The residual plot has 12 data points in approximately an upside-down U formation. The first 6 data points are gradually moving up and to the right. The last 6 data points are gradually moving down and to the right. 4 of the data points are below the horizontal axis. 2 of the data points touch the horizontal axis. 6 of the data points are above the horizontal axis. Moving from left to right: The first data point is farthest to the left and starts near negative 20 on the vertical axis. The second data point is below the horizontal axis and moves up and to the right. The third data point touches the horizontal axis and moves up and to the right. The fourth, fifth, and sixth data points are above the horizontal axis as they continue to move gradually up and to the right. The sixth and seventh data points are farthest from the horizontal axis, and both approximately align with a value of 10 on the vertical axis. The seventh, eighth, and ninth data points are above the horizontal axis as they continue to move gradually down and to the right. The tenth data point touches the horizontal axis and moves down and to the right. The eleventh data point is below the horizontal axis and moves down and to the right. The twelfth data point is farthest to the right and aligns with negative 20 on the vertical axis. ​A food vendor developed a new sandwich type for sale. The vendor made estimates about the sales of the new sandwich type over time. A linear regression was used to develop a model for the sales over time. The figure shows a graph of the residuals of the linear regression. Which of the following statements about the linear regression is true?",
