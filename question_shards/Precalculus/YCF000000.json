    "question": "​Water is poured into an empty vase at a constant rate. A graph (not shown) models the depth of the water in the vase over time. The graph can be described as follows: the graph is always increasing; the first portion of the graph is clearly concave up; and the next portion of the graph has a fairly steady and steep increase. Which of the following vases is appropriate for the context described by the graph?",
