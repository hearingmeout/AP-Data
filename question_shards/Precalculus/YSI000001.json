    "question": "The polar function is a portion of a loop with a horizontal orientation. Moving from the center to the outside of the grid: The function curves from 0 upward and to the right. The function passes radii of 2 and 4 and then reaches a maximum distance from the polar axis. The function then curves downward and to the right until it reaches the radius of 6.
