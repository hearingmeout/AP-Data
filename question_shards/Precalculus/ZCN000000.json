    "question": "The curve enters the window in the bottom of the third quadrant and increases sharply, crossing the x axis and leveling off to a high point in the second quadrant. The curve then gradually decreases then levels off to reach a low point on the y axis above the origin. The curve then gradually increases then levels off to reach a high point in the first quadrant, but lower than the previous high point. The curve decreases gradually to cross the x axis and levels off to reach a low point in the fourth quadrant. The curve increases gradually becoming steeper, crosses the x axis, and exits the window at the top of the first quadrant. ​The graph of the polynomial function <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> is shown. How many points of inflection does the graph of <math alttext=\"f\"><mi>f</mi></math> have on the given portion of the graph?",
