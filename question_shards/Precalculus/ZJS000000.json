    "question": "The horizontal axis is labeled Ounces and ranges from 0 to 8 in increments of 1. The vertical axis is labeled Cost (in dollars) and ranges from 0 to 4 in increments of 1. The graph is composed of six sections, each a horizontal line segment. The line segments are as follows: from (0 comma 2.54) to (3 comma 2.54), marked with a closed circle from (3 comma 2.74), marked with an open circle, to (4 comma 2.74), marked with a closed circle from (4 comma 2.94), marked with an open circle, to (5 comma 2.94), marked with a closed circle from (5 comma 3.14), marked with an open circle, to (6 comma 3.14), marked with a closed circle from (6 comma 3.34), marked with an open circle, to (7 comma 3.34), marked with a closed circle from (7 comma 3.54), marked with an open circle, to (8 comma 3.54), marked with a closed circle ​In 2016, the cost to mail a package was <math alttext=\"$ 2.54\"><mo>$</mo><mn>2.54</mn></math> for up to <math alttext=\"3\"><mn>3</mn></math> ounces, plus an additional cost of <math alttext=\"$ 0.20\"><mo>$</mo><mn>0.20</mn></math> for each additional ounce or portion of an ounce less than a full ounce. A portion of the graph of this relationship is given with cost, in dollars, as a function of ounces. Which of the following describes the restrictions on the range for such a function?",
