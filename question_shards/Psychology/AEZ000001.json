    "description": "Students enrolled in an introductory psychology course want to examine the bystander effect on their campus. The students devise a study in which one of them will pretend to fall while riding a scooter. The students choose a confederate from among the group to ride the scooter. The confederate will fall at the same location when many students are present. Then, the next day, the confederate will fall at the same location when fewer students are present. After each fall, the confederate will record whether they are helped.",
