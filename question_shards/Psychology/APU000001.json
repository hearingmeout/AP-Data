    "description": "In a recent study, researchers examined the impact of wearing face masks on speech perception. Participants were screened for normal hearing, then randomly assigned to one of two groups. Both groups listened to the same series of phrases spoken by a research assistant. In the first group, the research assistant wore a face mask, while in the second group, he did not. The researchers measured the amplitude at which the participants could hear the phrases with and without the face mask. The study’s findings indicated that wearing face masks impaired the participants’ ability to perceive speech.",
