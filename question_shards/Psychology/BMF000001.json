    "description": "Dr. Cruickshank conducted a study to examine whether cerebral cortex activity in the brain would be higher during memory retrieval for a test or during the initial learning process. She conducted brain scans on 10 volunteers while they were learning a new set of vocabulary words and while they were given a test on the same vocabulary words.",
    "question": "In which lobes of the brain should Dr. Cruickshank expect to see activity when subjects process the sounds of the vocabulary words?",
