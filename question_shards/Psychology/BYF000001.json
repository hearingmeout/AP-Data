    "description": "Professor Jain conducted a study investigating the impact of sleep deprivation on reaction time. After giving consent, 12 adult participants who typically slept 8 hours per night were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group maintained their typical amount of sleep of 8 hours. The other group reduced their typical amount of sleep to 4 hours. \n\nAfter waking from sleep, participants were given a reaction time test. The average reaction time, in seconds, for each participant is displayed in the table.\n\nAverage Reaction Time\n\n8-Hours-of-Sleep Group\n 4-Hours-of-Sleep Group\n\n4\n 4\n\n1\n 2\n\n2\n 8\n\n3\n 7\n\n3\n 3\n\n5\n 6",
