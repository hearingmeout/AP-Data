    "description": "Dr. Robles conducted a study to investigate the influence of emotion on problem-solving ability. She randomly assigned 100 participants to two groups of 50. \nOne group was shown a series of 15 highly emotional video clips and then categorized a list of 60 words using 10 different concepts. The other group categorized the list of words using the 10 concepts without watching any video clips. \nDr. Robles calculated each participant’s score based on categorizing words under the correct concepts. The more words participants categorized correctly, the higher their score.",
