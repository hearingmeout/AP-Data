Use appropriate psychological terminology in your response.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPain-related concerns are a primary reason people seek medical care. Most pain-related concerns are addressed using biological therapies such as psychoactive drugs. A growing interest in finding non-biological approaches to pain management led researchers to explore studies that used group therapy as an alternative approach for people experiencing chronic pain.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe researchers combined and analyzed findings from 29 peer-reviewed articles that presented studies on the use of group therapy to treat pain. Collectively, the studies included approximately 4,571 participants with an average age of 53.1 years old. Seventy-eight percent of participants were women, and 22% were men.1\n\nMost of the studies did not include other demographic information about the participants, but all of the studies were conducted in English-speaking nations. All of the studies included were approved by a committee of professionals to ensure the appropriateness of the study, and participants agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw from participation at any time. The researchers maintained the data in a way that would prevent participant information from being known.\n\nMethod\n\nThe researchers included studies that examined group therapy as an effective approach to pain management if those studies met the following conditions: \n\nUsed random assignment to groups with a manipulated independent variable \n\nWere published between 1990 and 2020\n\nInvolved participants who were diagnosed with or treated for fibromyalgia2, chronic pain, and/or specific pain \n\nMeasured changes in pain intensity before and after group therapy that used a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches \n\nUsed a “treatment-as-usual” or wait-listed control group \n\nIncluded at least 20 participants who completed the group therapy and related assessments \n\nIncluded groups that met at least three times face-to-face for group therapy \n\nMost of the studies focused on fibromyalgia or other, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain. Other types of pain reported by participants included chronic back pain, arthritis, combined back and neck pain, cancer-related pain, and headaches or migraines. \n\nAll of the studies examined the effectiveness of group therapy on pain management. Twelve of the groups had one person lead the sessions, and ten of the groups had more than one person lead the sessions. The most common treatment approach was cognitive-behavioral therapy (17 out of 29 studies). Sessions lasted an average of 120 minutes, with an average of 9 sessions offered per study. Most groups consisted of between 5 and 10 people (reported by 18 of the 29 studies).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe overall effect size of group therapy on reducing pain intensity was small. However, the researchers found significant improvements in patients’ outcomes aside from a reduction in pain intensity, patients reporting decreases in pain interference with their lives, patients thinking their pain is not the worst possible outcome (catastrophizing), and patients’ improved perceptions of pain, anxiety, depression, and barriers to physical functioning. The patients’ improvements remained consistent in long-term follow-ups lasting up to a year. These findings suggest that group therapy helps people who experience chronic pain by lessening their perception of pain intensity rather than alleviating their pain intensity.\n\nResearchers also found that group therapy was more effective for women who participated in women-only groups than for women who participated in mixed-gendered groups. According to the researchers, groups that used cognitive-behavioral therapy appeared to be less effective at addressing pain management than groups that used other approaches to therapy (e.g., behavioral therapy). The researchers speculated that since cognitive-behavioral therapy is less focused on building group cohesion, it may not be the best approach for group therapy that addresses pain management.\n\nBased on their findings, the researchers concluded that group therapy may be more effective than biological therapies in treating some pain-related concerns.\n\nAlldredge, C., Muñiz, V., & Henderson, T.
