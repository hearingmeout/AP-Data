    "description": "Researchers investigating well-being conducted a study that compared participants’ overall health with their self-reported levels of happiness. Medical doctors measured each participant’s vital signs and gave them a score from 1 to 50, with 1 indicating extremely poor health and 50 indicating near-perfect health. Participants then took a survey that assessed their overall happiness on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest level of happiness. The results are shown in the table.\n\nParticipant Health Scores and Happiness Ratings\n\nParticipant\n\nHealth Score\n\n(out of 50)\n\nHappiness Rating\n\n(out of 10)\n\nA\n 42\n 7\n\nB\n 10\n 1\n\nC\n 23\n 3\n\nD\n 48\n 8\n\nE\n 48\n 9\n\nF\n 26\n 1\n\nG\n 38\n 6\n\nH\n 39\n 7\n\nI\n 19\n 2\n\nJ\n 13\n 2\n\nK\n 46\n 10\n\nL\n 29\n 4",
