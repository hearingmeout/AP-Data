    "description": "Dr. Sanjay conducted a study to determine whether eating breakfast affects academic performance. At the beginning of the week, he gathered survey data from students in his third-grade class about whether they ate breakfast. The next day, Dr. Sanjay showed the students ten new vocabulary words. Three days later, he administered a test to the students to measure their word recall. After analyzing the data, he claimed that eating breakfast improves the ability to recall new words.",
