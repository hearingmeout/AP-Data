    "question": "An instructor conducted an experiment to determine the effects of two different methods of encoding on the amount students learned in introductory psychology. The results showed that the average amount learned by the group using one encoding method was greater than the average amount learned by the group using the other encoding method. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion to be drawn?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The group of students attaining the higher mean score had studied more than the other group.",

      {
        "label": "The better study method will have different effects for students of varying levels of ability.",
