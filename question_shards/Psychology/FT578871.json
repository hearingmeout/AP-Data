    "description": "Question is based on the following.\n\nA group of psychologists wanted to develop an intelligence test that would be quicker to administer than the one they were using, which was a standardized test that required answering as many questions correctly as possible in a given time. The existing test was considered valid and reliable. In the psychologists’ new test, participants had to find an image hidden in a visual display as quickly as possible. The psychologists collected data to determine the relation between the number of items the participants answered correctly on the original standardized test and the time it took them to spot the hidden image on the new test. The graph below displays the results.",
