    "description": "Researchers investigated the extent to which 30 pairs of identical and fraternal female twins shared with their twin a diagnosis for the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. Identical twins are genetically identical and share the same DNA pattern. Fraternal twins are only as genetically similar as any other sibling pair. Researchers found that 9 out of 16 pairs of the identical twins were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, while 1 out of 14 pairs of the fraternal twins were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. \n\nHolland, A.J., Hall, A., Murray, R., Russell, G.F., & Crisp, A.H.
