    "description": "Fluid Intelligence and Crystallized Intelligence Across the Life Span\n\nTwo lines are presented.\n\nThe first line is labeled Fluid:\n\nThe Fluid line begins at Birth, rises steadily to peak at 30 years, then steadily declines.\n\nThe second line is labeled Crystallized:\n\nThe Crystallized line begins slightly above the Fluid line.\n\nThe Crystallized line steadily increases at every age point and shows no decline with age.\n\nResearchers conducted a study comparing intelligence levels of people across their life spans, as shown in the graph.",
