    "description": "Jenna used treats to train a pig to put a wooden coin into a toy machine. She began by giving a treat whenever the pig got close to the coin. Then, she only gave the pig a treat when it touched the coin with its snout. After that, she only gave the pig a treat when it picked up the coin with its teeth.
