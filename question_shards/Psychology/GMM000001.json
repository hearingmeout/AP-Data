    "description": "Dr. Salim recruited a group of high school students who had reported experiencing high stress over the last 6 months. The students took a self-reported 10-point stress inventory before the study.\nThey were then randomly divided between a group that had no changes to their current daily schedule and another group that participated in a daily 20-minute mindfulness exercise. \nAfter eight weeks, all students were asked to self-report stress levels again by completing the same 10-point scale. Those in the mindfulness exercise group had a statistically significant decrease in their stress levels, while those who continued their daily routine had no change in self-reported stress.",
