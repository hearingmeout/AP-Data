    "description": "A study was conducted with fifty-five preteens (ages 9–12) who were not getting the recommended amount of sleep for their age. All preteens agreed to participate in the study. The participants were told they did not have to complete the study and could leave the study at any time. \nDuring the study, participants were randomly placed into either a group that gradually moved bedtimes earlier by five minutes each night or a control group that slept on their normal sleep cycle. The study’s purpose was disclosed to participants once the study was over.",
