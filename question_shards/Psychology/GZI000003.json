    "description": "Researchers were exploring depth perception in infants. In one study, researchers built a plexiglass box that appeared to have a ledge with a three-foot drop. There was no actual drop that could injure the infants. \n\nThe infants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the first group, each infant was encouraged to crawl over the ledge toward their mother, who was present on the other side of the box. In the second group, each infant could crawl around on the plexiglass box, but their mother was absent.\n\nResearchers measured how many infants crawled over the ledge to get to the other side of the box. The results are presented in the graph.\n\nPercentage of Infants Crawling Over the Ledge by Condition\n\nAll values are approximate.\n\nThe Percentage Crawling over the Ledge data for the 2 bars are as follows:\n\nWith Mother Present: 57%\n\nWithout Mother Present: 70%",
