    "description": "Dr. Faley conducted a study of 100 patients diagnosed with adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The first 50 patients identified for the study were given a new ADHD medication, while the rest were given a placebo. Patients received EEG scans before and after the treatment. The scans showed more typical brain activity in the participants who were given the medication than the participants who were given the placebo.",
    "question": "What should Dr. Faley have done to avoid potential confounding variables in the study?",
