    "description": "Researchers randomly selected 300 adults whom they interviewed about their perception of crime rates from 2002 to 2016. These perceived crime rates were then compared to actual crime rates, and the results of this comparison over that period are depicted in the graph.\n\nChanges in Actual Crime Versus Perceived Crime\n\nAll values are approximate.\nThe following 2 lines are shown:\nReal crime\nPerceived crime\nThe Real crime line:\nBegins at 2002: negative 6.5%\nFalls to 2004: negative 10.8%\nRises to 2008: negative 5%\nRemains level to 2010: negative 5%\nRises to 2012: negative 0.1%\nFalls to 2014: negative 8.3%\nRises to 2016: negative 2.3%\nThe Perceived crime line:\nBegins at 2002: negative 0.7%\nRises to 2004: 0%\nRises to 2006: 1.9%\nFalls to 2008: 1%\nRises to 2010: 2.1%\nFalls to 2012: negative 2.8%\nRises to 2014: negative 0.7%\nRises to 2016: 4%",
    "question": "In a subsequent study, researchers randomly assigned participants to one of two groups to determine whether viewing a video on actual crime rates enabled participants to make more accurate predictions. One group watched a video about the actual crime rates in recent years, and the other group watched an unrelated video. What is the independent variable in this study?",
