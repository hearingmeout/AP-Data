    "description": "Researchers conducted a study to examine a new treatment for bipolar disorder. Researchers randomly assigned participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder to either Group 1, which received the new treatment, or Group 2, which received the standard treatment. \n\nThe study focused on how the treatment affected the overall mood stability of participants compared with those who received the standard treatment. \n\nParticipants self-reported mood stability scores based on a scale ranging from 1 (least stable) to 10 (most stable), with higher scores indicating greater stability and fewer bipolar symptoms. The data are shown in the tables.\n\nTable 1: Group 1 Mood Stability Scores\n\nParticipant\n\nMood Stability Scores\n\nA\n\n6\n\nB\n\n8\n\nC\n\n6\n\nD\n\n5\n\nE\n\n9\n\nF\n\n7\n\nG\n\n8\n\nH\n\n6\n\nI\n\n9\n\nJ\n\n6\n\nTable 2: Group 2 Mood Stability Scores\n\nParticipant\n\nMood Stability Scores\n\nA\n\n5\n\nB\n\n6\n\nC\n\n4\n\nD\n\n7\n\nE\n\n3\n\nF\n\n5\n\nG\n\n6\n\nH\n\n4\n\nI\n\n5\n\nJ\n\n5",
