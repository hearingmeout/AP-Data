    "description": "A study was conducted with first-year students in a high-stress honors program at a university. At the beginning of the semester, two hundred students in the program were selected at random and asked to complete two surveys. \nThe first survey measured their stress levels related to school, and the second was a health questionnaire measuring recent illnesses. Participants again completed both surveys during exam week at the end of the semester. \nThe results of the study showed that as school-related stress levels increased, the number of illnesses also increased. The researchers concluded that school stress causes students to experience more illness.",
