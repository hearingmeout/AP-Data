    "description": "The amount of hearing loss a person experiences is based on hearing sensitivity. Hearing sensitivity is determined by measuring the absolute threshold for hearing. The graph shows the hearing thresholds for individuals in different age groups, measured in decibels.1\n\nHearing Thresholds at Different Frequencies by Age Group\n\nThe following hearing ranges are indicated:\n\n0 to 20 decibels: Normal Hearing Range\n\n20 to 40 decibels: Mild Hearing Loss Range\n\n40 to 70 decibels: Moderate Hearing Loss Range\n\n70 to 90 decibels: Severe Hearing Loss Range\n\n90 to 100 decibels: Profound Hearing Loss Range\n\nThe following 4 lines representing ages are shown:\n\n20 years\n\n40 years\n\n60 years\n\n90 years\n\nAll values are approximate.\n\nThe 20 years line:\n\nBegins at frequency 125, 0 decibels\n\nRemains level to frequency 1,000, 0 decibels\n\nFalls gradually to frequency 8,000, 10 decibels\n\nThe 40 years line:\n\nBegins at frequency 125, 7 decibels\n\nFalls gradually to frequency 1,000, 8 decibels\n\nFalls gradually to frequency 8,000, 31 decibels\n\nThe 60 years line:\n\nBegins at frequency 125, 15 decibels\n\nRemains level to frequency 1,000, 15 decibels\n\nFalls gradually to frequency 2,000, 25 decibels\n\nFalls sharply to frequency 8,000, 72 decibels\n\nThe 90 years line:\n\nBegins at frequency 125, 22 decibels\n\nFalls gradually to frequency 1,000, 23 decibels\n\nFalls gradually to frequency 2,000, 36 decibels\n\nFalls sharply to frequency 8,000, 100 decibels\n\nA note indicates the figure is not drawn to scale.\n\n1: A sound’s amplitude is measured on the decibel scale. The more intense, or louder the sound is, the higher the decibel level. The human threshold for hearing is 0 decibels.↩",
