    "description": "A recent study aimed to investigate the relationship between attribution and high school grade point average (GPA). As part of this study, high school students were asked to complete an attribution inventory that assessed their beliefs about the factors that determine their high school GPA. These factors included whether students believed their GPA was due to their intelligence and determination or luck.\nThe researchers focused on students who attributed their high school GPA to luck and compared their attribution inventory score with their actual high school GPA, which is shown in the graph. Higher scores indicate a more external attribution for GPA.\n\nAttribution Inventory Score and Grade Point Average\n\nThe scatterplot has 14 data points.\nThe data points are in a linear pattern trending down from left to right.\nThe data points have the following approximate (Grade Point Average comma Attribution Inventory Score) coordinates:\n(2 comma 10)\n(2 comma 9)\n(2 comma 8)\n(2 comma 7)\n(2.3 comma 6)\n(2.6 comma 8)\n(2.6 comma 5)\n(3 comma 6)\n(3.1 comma 7)\n(3.2 comma 8)\n(3.7 comma 3)\n(3.8 comma 4)\n(3.8 comma 1)\n(4 comma 0)\nA line of best fit is shown:\nThe line of best fit slants down from left to right.\nThe line of best fit passes through the following approximate (Grade Point Average comma Attribution Inventory Score) coordinates:\n(2 comma 9)\n(3 comma 5)",
