    "description": "In a study, researchers recruited 10 graduate students at their university to complete a series of tasks in a lab. Participants were asked to rate how desirable they found each item, both a toaster and a microwave, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not desirable and 10 being very desirable. After completing several complex math problems, participants were told that they could choose either a toaster or a microwave as a prize for participating in the study. After selecting their prize, participants were asked to rate the desirability of both items again. The researchers then compared the participants’ ratings of the items at the beginning of the study and the ratings that the participants provided after choosing their prize. The results are given in the tables. \n\nParticipants Who Chose a Toaster as Their Prize\n\nMean Rating of Toaster\n\nMean Rating of Microwave\n\nBefore choosing toaster\n\nAfter choosing toaster\n\nBefore choosing toaster\n\nAfter choosing toaster\n\n3.4\n\n8.8\n\n2.6\n\n1.4\n\nParticipants Who Chose a Microwave as Their Prize\n\nMean Rating of Toaster\n\nMean Rating of Microwave\n\nBefore choosing microwave\n\nAfter choosing microwave\n\nBefore choosing microwave\n\nAfter choosing microwave\n\n3.4\n\n2\n\n3.8\n\n8.8",
