    "description": "A social psychologist conducted a study to examine the effect of the availability heuristic on judgment. The psychologist recruited 20 participants for the study and assigned them to one of two groups. \nThe participants completed a survey. One survey question asked participants to rate the likelihood that they would become the victim of a crime. Participants in Group A read a series of news reports about crime-related incidents and then completed the survey. The participants in Group B completed the survey without exposure to the news reports.\nThe table presents the mean ratings by participants of how likely they thought they would be to become the victim of a crime, divided by group.\n\nMean Ratings of How Likely Participants Thought They Would Become a Victim of a Crime\n\nGroup A:\nParticipants Exposed to the News\nGroup B: \nParticipants Not Exposed to the NewsCrime Likelihood Mean Ratings\n92%\n6%",
