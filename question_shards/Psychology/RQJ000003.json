    "description": "A memory researcher conducted a study to determine whether words are easier or harder to recall based on when they are presented in a sequence of words. She read a list of words to participants for 60 seconds at a constant rate. Each word was read once, and no words were repeated. The participants were tested on their recall of the words. The results are given in the graph. \n\nNumber of Words Recalled as a Function of When Read\n\nThe Number of Words Recalled data for the 3 bars are as follows:\n\nFirst 20 Seconds: 16\n\nSecond 20 Seconds: 8\n\nThird 20 Seconds: 18",
