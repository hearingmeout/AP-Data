    "description": "Dr. Hains conducted a memory experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 was given a list of words that were not related to one another. Group 2 was given a list of words that were related to one another. In both lists, each word was listed once. Both groups were given one minute to memorize the list. After a five-minute pause, participants were asked to write down as many words as they could recall.",
