    "description": "Dr. Blankenship is conducting a study on obedience that will take place at a local shopping center. Participants will be asked to complete a survey about their favorite sports teams. Participants will be told that the study is looking at their responses to the survey. However, Dr. Blankenship is actually studying whether the participants will obey when the experimenter tells them they are required to stay in an uncomfortably overheated testing room for 20 minutes after they complete the survey.",
