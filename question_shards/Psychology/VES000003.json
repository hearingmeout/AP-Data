    "question": "Researchers conducted a study with 200 participants who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and a comparison group of 200 patients who had not been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The researchers found that participants who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia had statistically larger ventricles1brain cavities filled with fluid  than the comparison group. Based on this finding, the researchers concluded that enlarged ventricles cause people to develop schizophrenia. \nWhich of the following most accurately describes why this conclusion is flawed?",
