    "question": "Luis constructed a flip-book with 30 different still images of a cartoon cat. When Luis quickly flipped through successive images of the cat, the cat appeared to move. Which of the following concepts does the example illustrate?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Stroboscopic movement, because the book is a series of images presented at separate time intervals.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Perceptual constancy, because Luis still views the cat as a cat even though it appears as a moving picture.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Depth perception, because Luis needs both eyes to view the movement.",

        "label": "Interposition, because the pictures are in a sequence that is logical.",
