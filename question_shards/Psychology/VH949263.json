    "question": "Dr. Frishkoff is studying how participants’ brain activity changes when they read sentences in which the last word is either expected (“The pizza was too hot to eat”) or unexpected (“The pizza was too hot to cry”). While participants are reading, Dr. Frishkoff measures their brain activity. The results of her experiment are shown below.\n\nDr. Frishkoff could accurately describe the results of her study by saying that participants",
