    "question": "Leo and Caitlin are both experiencing feelings about their date tonight. Leo has had bad dates lately, and so he feels fear and dejection. Caitlin, meanwhile, has had very good dates, and so she feels excited and happy. Which of the following describes emotional appraisal in this scenario?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Leo and Caitlin have an immediate unconscious interpretation of the scenario, which leads them to simultaneously both label their feelings as either positive or negative and have the appropriate physiological response",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Leo is able to identify his response as fear more quickly than Caitlin can identify her response as excitement because fear is more evolutionarily important and thus is processed more quickly",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Leo and Caitlin experience different physiological responses to the impending date and interpret their emotional responses accordingly",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Leo and Caitlin both experience a physiological response and feel either fear or excitement simultaneously",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "Leo and Caitlin have an immediate unconscious interpretation of the scenario, which leads them to simultaneously both label their feelings as either positive or negative and have the appropriate physiological response"
