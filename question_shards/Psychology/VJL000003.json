    "description": "Sleep researchers conducted a study to determine if wearing a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine helps individuals who are experiencing symptoms of sleep apnea to increase their levels of REM sleep compared to those not using a CPAP device. \n\nTwenty participants with sleep apnea who did not previously wear a CPAP device were randomly placed into one of two groups. Group 1 slept without wearing a CPAP device, and researchers measured the percentage of total sleep time each participant spent in REM. \n\nParticipants in Group 2 were given a CPAP device to wear while sleeping and researchers measured the percentage of total sleep time each participant spent in REM. The results are given in the graph.\n\nREM Sleep and CPAP Machines\n\nThe REM Sleep as a Percentage of Total Sleep Time data for the 2 bars are as follows:\n\nGroup 1 - Without C P A P: 10%\n\nGroup 2 - With C P A P: 30%",
    "question": "Which of the following psychological perspectives would best support a researcher’s belief that the dreams that occur in REM sleep are a result of random neural firing in the brain stem?",
