    "description": "Researchers tested infants whose first language was either English or Hindi. The researchers assessed the ability of these infants to distinguish between the /ta/ versus /Ta/ sounds in Hindi at various ages. The difference in these sounds is indistinguishable to adults who speak English only. The results of this study suggest that the ability to distinguish sounds in a language other than a person’s first language decreases with age.\n\nPercent of Infants Able to Distinguish Sounds \n\nby Age in Months\n\nFor each data category, the following bars are shown:\n\nEnglish-speaking infants.\n\nHindi-speaking infants.\n\nAll values are approximate.\n\nThe data for the 3 categories are as follows:\n\n6 to 8 months:\n\nEnglish-speaking infants: 90%\n\nHindi-speaking infants: 100%\n\n8 to 10 months:\n\nEnglish-speaking infants: 70%\n\nHindi-speaking infants: 100%\n\n10 to 12 months:\n\nEnglish-speaking infants: 25%\n\nHindi-speaking infants: 100%",
