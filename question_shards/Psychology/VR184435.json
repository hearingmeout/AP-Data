    "description": "Romina was at the park with her daughter and noticed several of the other mothers successfully redirecting their children’s attention away from an ice-cream truck. Romina’s daughter, who noticed the ice-cream truck, threw a tantrum when she did not get to buy some ice cream. The next time she took her daughter to the park, Romina made sure to notice the truck before her daughter did and redirected her behavior using the same techniques the other mothers used.",
