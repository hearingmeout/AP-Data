A fourth-grade class is tested in the morning and a sixth-grade class is tested in the afternoon. The percent recall for both classes was combined and is presented in the figure above.",
    "question": "The teacher noticed that the afternoon class recalled more presidents than the morning class did and concluded that this was caused by time of day. Which of the following is a confounding variable?",
