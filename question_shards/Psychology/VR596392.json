    "description": "While working with individuals who have a spider phobia, Dr. Nielsen wants to determine whether exposing them to spiders will reduce their fears. Dr. Nielsen asks one participant to watch a ten-minute video about spiders and report the anxiety they experienced on a ten-point scale (1 equals \"not at all anxious,\" and 10 equals “extremely anxious”) every two minutes. The data Dr. Nielsen obtained from the participant are presented in the graph.",
    "question": "Based on the graph, which of the following conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of this approach?",
