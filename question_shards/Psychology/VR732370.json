    "question": "In a memory study, participants were given different things to focus on as they tried to remember words presented. For some of the words, they were asked whether the word was in capital letters (case); for others, whether the word rhymed with a target word (rhyme); and for still others, whether the word belonged in a given sentence (sentence). Which of the following statements is supported by the graph?",

      {
        "label": "Participants in the rhyme condition relied mostly on semantic encoding.",

      {
        "label": "Participants in the sentence condition remembered more than those in the rhyme condition because they utilized distributed rehearsal.",
