    "question": "Dr. Amie conducts an experiment in which participants are asked to observe a recorded lecture and either take notes as they watch in real time or take notes when they pause the lecture every minute. She then gives them a test to evaluate their knowledge about the information presented. To reduce the likelihood of confounding variables influencing the experiment, Dr. Amie should do which of the following?",
