    "question": "Dr. Naum is studying the function of the temporal lobe of the brain by examining the case study of J.S., an individual who incurred damage in this area during a motor vehicle accident. Dr. Naum administers a battery of tasks multiple times over the course of several weeks to assess J.S.’s cognitive abilities. The graph below shows J.S.’s performance on three different tasks. The bar on the left shows his accuracy forming new memories in a lab context, the middle bar shows his accuracy on a driving course, and the bar on the right shows his accuracy on a third task.\n\nBased on the scores on the three tasks, Task 3 most likely involves",
