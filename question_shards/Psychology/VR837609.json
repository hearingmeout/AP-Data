    "question": "Volunteers were asked to rate the taste of foods during allergy season on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning low intensity of flavor and 10 meaning high intensity of flavor. The researchers also asked participants to rate their level of nasal congestion on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning no nasal congestion and 10 meaning complete blockage of airways with congestion. Which of the following is an appropriate conclusion to draw from the data presented in the scatterplot?",
