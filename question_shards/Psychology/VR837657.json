    "question": "Degree First Observed Movement\n Degree First Observed Color\n\n23 degrees\n 51 degrees\n\nResearchers were interested in whether the rods or the cones in the retina were more sensitive to detecting the movement and the color of objects in the environment. Research participants were asked to stare at a focus point while the researcher, starting at 0º, moved a red-colored object slowly around the edge of the arc apparatus. The degree of the angle when the participants first observed movement and color were documented. The mean degrees for each are presented in the table. Which of the following conclusions is best supported by this data?",
