    "question": "Dr. Handler conducted research to explore the extent to which hearing acuity changes with age. She tested the absolute threshold for hearing in 10 subjects of various ages. The results are presented in the table.\n\nSubject\n Age\n Highest frequency of sound detected <math alttext=\"in hertz\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mtext>Hz</mtext></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math>\n\n1\n 15\n 18,000\n\n2\n 65\n 10,500\n\n3\n 45\n 13,250\n\n4\n 80\n 8,000\n\n5\n 18\n 17,500\n\n6\n 35\n 15,000\n\n7\n 55\n 11,500\n\n8\n 26\n 22,000\n\n9\n 63\n 9,400\n\n10\n 41\n 16,300\n\nWhich of the following is an appropriate conclusion based on the data presented in the table?",
