    "description": "Dr. Copeland is interested in studying how diet impacts the nervous system activity of professional dancers. She randomly assigns a group of professional ballet dancers to either a protein-rich diet or a carbohydrate-rich diet. After three weeks on each food plan, she measures the function of specific parts of the brain and nervous systems while they are dancing.",
    "question": "Dr. Copeland found that ballet dancers on a carbohydrate-rich diet had greater activity levels in the somatic nervous system. Which is a prediction that can be made from these findings?",
