    "question": "In an experiment, participants sat at a computer and were told to focus on an X on the screen for 50 milliseconds. After this, a horizontal or vertical line was presented for 100 milliseconds. Participants were instructed to press a button every time a horizontal line appeared. Participants in the Reward condition received ten cents for each time they correctly pressed the button when the horizontal line appeared, while participants in the Punishment condition started the experiment with $10 and lost ten cents every time they incorrectly pressed the button when there was no horizontal line. The results are given in the table.\n\nReward Condition\n Punishment Condition\n\nHits\n 54\n 42\n\nMisses\n 10\n 40\n\nFalse Positives\n 36\n 18\n\nWhich of the following is the best conclusion based the data in the table?",
