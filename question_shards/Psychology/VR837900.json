    "question": "Neurologists trying to find a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease selected 100 individuals with moderate to severe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Fifty participants were randomly placed into either an experimental condition that received a new medication that acted as an agonist for acetylcholine or the control condition which continued to receive same care as before. The study lasted for ten weeks at which time members of both groups took a cognitive assessment to determine their level of functioning. Which of the following best explains the operational definition of the dependent variable in this study?",
