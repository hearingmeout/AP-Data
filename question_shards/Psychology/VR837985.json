    "question": "Dr. Jones conducted a study in which he surveyed participants and compared their reported levels of physical activity to their measures of brain plasticity. Dr. Jones concludes that higher levels of physical activity cause a greater degree of neuroplastic changes in the brain. He plans to publish his findings. What mistake is Dr. Jones making in his research conclusion?",
