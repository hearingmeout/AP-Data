    "description": "A study was conducted to determine the power of a new chemical to increase the quality of olfactory sensations in humans. Participants were asked to rate the quality of a chocolate bar, before and after inhaling the chemical on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning low quality and 10 meaning high quality. Analysis of the data showed that the difference in perceived quality of the chocolate bar before and after exposure to the chemical was statistically significant.\n\nPerceived Quality of Chocolate Bar Participant #BEFORE EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALAFTER EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALDIFFERENCE (After – Before) 158326104336346935572Mean Difference = 3 Standard Deviation = 0.71",
    "question": "If these data were plotted on a graph, what percent of the scores for the difference in perceived quality of the chocolate bar are within 2.29 and 3.71?",
