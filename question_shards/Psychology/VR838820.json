    "description": "Researchers measured changes in neural firing in the frontal lobes for ten rats that were exposed to stimulants. The researchers used an MRI that indicates brain activity with colors. Normal brain activity is indicated by greens and yellows. High brain activity is indicated by reds and oranges. Low brain activity is indicated by grays and blues. All the rat’s brains showed normal activity prior to being exposed to the stimulant.",
    "question": "What is the operational definition of neural activity in the rats?",
