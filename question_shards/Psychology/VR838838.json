    "description": "Researchers measured changes in neural firing in the frontal lobes for ten rats that were exposed to stimulants. The researchers used an MRI that indicates brain activity with colors. Normal brain activity is indicated by greens and yellows. High brain activity is indicated by reds and oranges. Low brain activity is indicated by grays and blues. All the rat’s brains showed normal activity prior to being exposed to the stimulant.",
    "question": "Which of the following is a prediction that could be made about the activity of the rats’ brains when exposed to the stimulant?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The MRI will show more greens and yellows when exposed to the stimulants.",

      {
        "label": "The MRI will show no difference in neural activity.",
