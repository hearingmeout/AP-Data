    "question": "Researchers conducted an experiment on baboons by inserting a wire into the reticular activating system (RAS) that produced a mild electrical current. The researchers stimulated the RAS while the baboons were performing different tasks. Which of the following operational definitions would be most easily replicated by other researchers trying to duplicate the experiment?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The baboons were observed to see if they were more awake after they had the RAS stimulated.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The baboons’ heart rates were measured by a monitor attached to their chest before and after the RAS was stimulated.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The baboons enjoyed a food reward after the mild electrical current was experienced.",

      {
        "label": "The baboons were observed to see if they were more aggressive after having the RAS stimulated.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The baboons’ heart rates were measured by a monitor attached to their chest before and after the RAS was stimulated."
