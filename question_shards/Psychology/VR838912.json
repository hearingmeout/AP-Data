Use appropriate psychological terminology in your response.\n\nUsing the source provided, respond to the following questions. \n\nIdentify the research method used in the study.\n\nState the operational definition of addiction.\n\nDescribe the meaning of the percentages presented in the “hourly wage of those who are employed” category of demographic data.\n\nIdentify one ethical guideline described in the study. Describe one way the researchers in the study applied this ethical guideline.\n\nSource\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify factors that make a substance abuse recovery program successful. Researchers identified a long-term program that provided housing, life-skills training, and several types of counseling for women with a history of trauma for this study.\n\nParticipants\n\nThirty-nine women who were previous residents of the long-term recovery program participated in group interviews about their experiences in and perceptions of the program. All participants agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw from participation at any time. The research was approved by a committee of professionals to ensure the appropriateness of the study. Demographic information about the participants is given in the table.\n\nVariable\n Number of Participants\n Percent of Participants\n\nAge\n\n29 or less\n 10\n 26.3%\n\n30 to 49\n 12\n 31.6%\n\n50 or older\n 16\n 42.1%\n\nRace/ethnicity\n\nAfrican American\n 35\n 89.7%\n\nMixed Race\n 3\n 7.7%\n\nWhite\n 1\n 2.6%\n\nEmployment: “Are you currently employed?”\n\nYes\n 28\n 71.8%\n\nNo\n 11\n 28.2%\n\nHourly wage of those who are employed\n\n$10.00-$12.99/hour\n 12\n 54.5%\n\n$13.00-$15.99/hour\n 6\n 27.3%\n\n$16.00 and higher/hour\n 4\n 18.2%\n\nNumber of children\n\n1 to 3\n 23\n 69.9%\n\n4 to 8\n 11\n 30.6%\n\nMethod\n\nThe recovery program viewed “recovery” as focusing on reducing the harm caused to an individual’s health and well-being by the misuse of substances. This view of recovery focuses on social causes of substance use and abuse, such as poverty, physical or emotional abuse in one’s home, or homelessness, and teaching people how to deal with those stressors through more healthful ways of thinking and behaving. The women participated in four group interviews over a six-month period that were recorded and transcribed word-for-word. Researchers ensured that the individual participants could not be identified from the data collected. A team of three researchers analyzed the recordings and transcripts. Researchers developed a code manual that “organized the data for accurate interpretation” across all three researchers. Researchers first developed a list of codes that corresponded to common aspects of successful recovery programs. Then, as the responses were read, the researchers would categorize each response with an existing code. Researchers would add a new code for each new topic the participants brought up in their responses.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nFour major themes for successful recovery programs emerged from the participants’ responses based on the most frequently occurring codes:\n\nKnowledge of addiction as a disease – Participants shared that they did not often realize that their substance use could be classified as an addiction. The researchers coded participant responses that referenced overuse or “abusive” use of substances as indications of addiction.\n\nImportance of social support and support groups – Participants shared the importance of three main kinds of social support: 1) family and friend support; 2) organized support groups, and 3) support from other participants in the recovery program. Attending support groups while living in the recovery program helped women develop positive support and broke down barriers to recovery like lack of transportation, childcare, or accountability.\n\nPeace of mind that comes from a new lifestyle – Participants shared that while their lives were not stress-free, they felt a sense of peace by not using substances. The participants reported that being in the program taught them ways to reconsider their responses to stress more effectively, leading to a sense of peace instead of turmoil.\n\nDesire to maintain recovery – Many participants reported that they wanted to maintain their new substance-free lifestyles. One participant reported that “I’m going to do whatever it is I have to do to make sure that we [she and her child] don’t ever have to go back to that [being homeless and abusing substances].”\n\nAfter categorizing the responses from the participants into these four categories, the researchers believe that the participants’ responses show that the program had a positive impact on the participants’ recovery. The researchers recommend that programs follow a similar model of recovery to improve outcomes for women experiencing substance use disorders.\nAdapted from Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology.Krueger, E., Deal, E., Lopez.
