    "question": "Researchers conducted a correlational study during the winter season, which has shorter days and longer nights. The researcher asked about people’s experiences with depression-like symptoms, including feelings of tiredness and reduction in energy output. The researcher found that there was a positive correlation between the amount of daylight and depression-like symptoms. Which of the following statements best reflects how to interpret this correlational finding?",
