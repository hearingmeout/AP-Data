    "question": "Dr. Barry conducted a study in which participants were put into a driving simulator that mimicked the experience of driving a car on the highway. Participants were split into three groups:\n\nThe Silence condition, where participants drove in silence with no external distractions\n\nThe Radio condition, where participants listened to the radio while driving and were told they would be asked questions about what they heard after\n\nThe Cell Phone condition, where participants received text messages every 90 seconds and were told they would be asked questions about the messages after\n\nAt random intervals during the driving time, participants would see obstacles they needed to avoid, and the simulator would record how long it took the participants to hit the brake. The results of the study are given in the figure:\n\nWhat conclusion could the researchers best draw from the results collected in the study?",
