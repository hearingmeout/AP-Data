    "question": "Researchers repeatedly presented a picture of a goat along with other animals and asked participants to rank how closely the picture of the goat matched their prototype of a “mammal.” Participants used a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 meaning “not at all like my prototype of a mammal” to 5 meaning “exactly like my prototype of a mammal.” The graph depicts the rankings of each participant based on the number of exposures. What type of research has been conducted?",
