    "question": "At the end of each class period, Professor Dodgson asks each student to write on a notecard which concepts from the class period they understood, which ones they didn’t understand, and a plan for how they will approach learning any confusing concepts. This is not a required activity, but Professor Dodgson collects the cards and records which students complete them. The figure depicts student scores on the most recent test, along with how many notecards (out of 20) each student completed. Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of the data depicted in the graph?",
