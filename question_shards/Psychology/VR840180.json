    "question": "Alumni of a small high school where everyone knew each other were tracked down twenty years after their high school graduation. Alumni were shown photographs of other individuals they graduated with. First, they were asked if they recognized the person in the photograph. Participants responded “yes” 75% of the time. Next, they were asked if they knew the person’s name. Participants could only correctly name the person in the photograph 25% of the time. Which of the following is the dependent variable in the recall condition?",
