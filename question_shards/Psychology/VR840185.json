    "question": "Dr. Shay is designing a research study to demonstrate the serial position effect. They asked 10 of their friends to volunteer as participants in the study. Half of the participants were randomly assigned Group A and shown eight random words on a computer screen. After viewing the words, members of Group A were asked to recall as many words as possible. The other half of the students randomly assigned to Group B also viewed a set of eight random words. After viewing the words, students in Group B were asked to count backwards from one hundred, in increments of 3, before recalling any of the words. What is the design flaw of this study?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Group B will recall fewer words than Group A.",
