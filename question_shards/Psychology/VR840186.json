He randomly assigned 20 college students in his anatomy class to two groups. Participants in Group A were given a list of 20 class concepts and 10 minutes to study them using the method of loci. Those in Group B were given the same list but were told to repeat each term 10 times as their study method. When each group finished the task, Dr. Scott administered a recall quiz. The scores for each group are presented in the table. What is the median score for Group A and Group B, respectively?",
