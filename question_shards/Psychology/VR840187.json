    "question": "Dr. Hayes is studying people’s memories. She had a group of randomly selected participants learn a list of dates related to historical events. Group 1 had to recall the dates without any cues, and Group 2 was given a one-word cue to help them with their recall of the dates. Dr. Hayes then asked the participants to rank how strongly they agreed with the following statement: How confident are you that you remembered the dates accurately? Participants were given a range of numbers to choose from to rank their level of agreement, from 1 meaning they were not confident at all to 5 meaning they were absolutely confident. Which of the following measurement tools was Dr. Hayes using in this study?",
