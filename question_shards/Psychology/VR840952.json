    "description": "Dr. Miller believes cell phone usage affects short-term memory ability. He randomly selected 20 male students from his university to participate and gave them a survey. Participants were asked a series of questions about how often they use their cell phone and whether they recalled information about world events. The data from the survey is presented in the graph below.\n\nNumber of Hours Using a Cell Phone Per Day",
