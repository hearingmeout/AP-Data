    "question": "Fatima tries out for the debate team at her school because she believes that debate team members are the smartest kids in school. She is not chosen as a team member.

She now decides that she knew she should not have tried out since she is a sophomore and not a member of the History Club. Which of the following cognitive processes is Fatima using to justify her failure to make the team?",
