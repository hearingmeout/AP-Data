    "question": "A researcher is studying the accuracy of people’s memories when they use mnemonic devices. After studying the first 10 people, the data showed that memories using mnemonic devices were more accurate than the average’s person’s memories. Which of the following explains why the researcher should not draw any conclusions about the accuracy of memories using mnemonic devices yet?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The data is positively skewed, which means the data was not collected correctly.",

      {
        "label": "The research method is an experiment, meaning she can draw cause-and-effect conclusions regardless of the sample size.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The researcher should expect that the more data she collects, the more likely the results will regress to the mean.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The research method is a correlation, so she cannot infer causation from the results.",

      }

    "answer": "The researcher should expect that the more data she collects, the more likely the results will regress to the mean."
