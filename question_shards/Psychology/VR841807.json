    "question": "Group\n Mean\n Standard Deviation\n\nEncoding Strategies Group\n 84.6\n 3.4\n\nContinued Study Group\n 72.9\n 12.6\n\nA high school instructor wanted to see if implementing encoding strategies would help students master concepts in AP Psychology. They conduct a double-blind study in which students are randomly assigned to either the encoding strategy group or the group that continued to study as they had before. The data for each group is presented in the table. Which of the following best represents the results of this investigation?",
