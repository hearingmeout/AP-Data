    "question": "Professor DuVall teaches two classes of psychology. For Class Y, their first quiz consisted of multiple-choice questions. Class Z’s first quiz covered the same material, but the questions required that students write a short answer for each question. Professor DuVall compared the scores for Class Y and Class Z and found that the mean score for Class Y was 76%, while the mean score for Class Z was 89%. In terms of memory retrieval processes, which of the following is consistent with this outcome?",
