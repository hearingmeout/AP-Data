    "question": "Dr. Adeyemi obtains IRB approval for a study examining the effects of growth mindset versus fixed mindset on people’s motivation for learning new information. They recruit 80 participants and receive informed consent from them. Participants then complete a questionnaire about learning strategies. Next, the participants are told that, based on their results, they are either able to readily learn new information or that they will struggle to learn new information. In reality, this questionnaire is meaningless, and participants are randomly told fake results. After hearing their results, the participants are then tested on their ability to learn complex new information. In terms of ethical procedures, after the data are collected, it will be important for Dr. Adeyemi to do which of the following?",
