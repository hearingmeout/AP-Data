    "description": "A group of 25 American college students who were taking introductory psychology during the spring semester participated in a study about cognition. Participants were first asked to read a story about a Russian battle from the 19th century. Later, participants were asked to write down as many details as they could remember from the story. Twenty-two out of 25 of the students changed some of the details of the story, such as referring to a “house” instead of using the Russian word “dacha” that was used in the story.",
    "question": "Which of the following would explain why the students changed details in their recall of the study?",
