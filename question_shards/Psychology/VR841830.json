    "description": "Cory’s Skateboards, Incorporated, has been producing their top-selling Model A skateboard for 10 years. The company has just developed a new skateboard, Model B. Company executives want to test whether customers who have already used Model A will be able to learn more quickly to skateboard using Model B as compared to those who have no experience. The company’s research team recruits 50 participants for their study and randomly assigns them to two groups. Group 1 is given 3 weeks of skateboarding lessons using the Model A skateboard. Group B does not have lessons on how to use a skateboard. At the end of the 3-week period, both groups are given skateboarding lessons using the Model B skateboard. The research team collects data on how long it takes individuals in each group to become proficient at skateboarding on Model B. They find that it takes Group 1 participants significantly longer to become proficient on Model B, as compared to Group 2.",
