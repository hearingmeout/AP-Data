    "description": "Counterconditioning and Anxiety\n\nDr. Abrams treats patients with anxiety by using a form of counterconditioning called exposure therapy. To test the effectiveness of this technique, Dr. Abrams had each patient report their level of anxiety while repeatedly exposing each person to an anxiety-inducing situation for one hour using a virtual reality headset. Patients rated their anxiety from 0-8, with 0 being no anxiety to 8 being extreme anxiety. The results are presented in the graph.",
    "question": "Which of the following describes the measurement instrument that Dr. Abrams’ patients used to report their anxiety?",
