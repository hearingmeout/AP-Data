    "question": "Effect Size of Performance on Social Development Test\n\nA research study compares the performance of typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a test of social development. All children are 4 years old, and researchers want to determine if they have a theory of mind. The effect size for the difference in performance between the two groups is presented in the graph.\nWhat does this effect size indicate about the difference in performance?",
