    "question": "Dr. Picard performs a study of children’s perceptions of gender roles. Children are randomly assigned to one of two groups. Children in Group A are shown simplified drawings of people (stick figures) wearing different types of clothing and are asked to sort these based on gender. Children in Group B are shown stick figure drawings of people performing various household tasks such as washing dishes, cooking, mowing a lawn, or fixing a leaky faucet. They are then asked to sort these drawings based on gender.\n\nWhich of the following is the independent variable in this study?",
