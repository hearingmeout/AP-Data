    "description": "Researchers are interested in the relationship between the classical conditioning of an eyeblink response and aging. While taking an intelligence test, elderly subjects wore special goggles that administered a puff of air into their eyes after a tone sounded. Although participants were told the purpose of the experiment was to see if intelligence declined as people aged, the real purpose of the study was to measure the length of time it took for elderly participants to learn the association between the sound of the tone and the puff of air.",
    "question": "Which of the following ethical procedures must be used to account for the deception used in this study?",
