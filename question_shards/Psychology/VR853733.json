    "question": "Researchers hypothesize that the older a baby is when it begins to crawl, the longer it will take the baby to stop exhibiting earlier rocking behaviors. The researchers go into the infant room of a day care center every day for six weeks. Every time a baby rocks, the researchers record it. They document which babies are already crawlers and at what age each started crawling. What will help the researchers with their investigation?",
