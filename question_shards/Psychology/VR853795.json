    "question": "Researchers conducted a study to investigate whether problem-solving abilities declined as subjects got older. They gave a large random sample of 20-year-old subjects a test with various problem-solving tasks. For the next 40 years, the researchers followed up every five years with the subjects and had them complete additional tests to gauge their problem-solving abilities. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding this research?",
