    "description": "A researcher studied the impact of early childhood education on disadvantaged children. Half of the children were randomly assigned to receive high-quality preschool, while the other half received no opportunity to attend preschool. The study collected extensive data on the children from the study until they reached age 40. The researchers were able to conclude that high-quality preschool positively affected education, socioeconomic status, crime prevention, family dynamics, and health.",
