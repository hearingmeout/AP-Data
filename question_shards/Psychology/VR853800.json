    "description": "Dr. Norman conducts a study about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses and gender. They gather data from a local college’s admissions and registration department. Within the population of the college, 52% identified as female, 45% identified as male, and the remaining identified as “nonbinary, other, or prefer not to say.” Additionally, of the students registered as majors in STEM subjects, 34% identified as female, 59% identified as male, and the remainder identified as “nonbinary, other, or preferred not to say.”",
