    "description": "Researchers were interested in seeing how quickly toddlers learned how to play with a new toy while interacting with one of their caregivers. They documented the number of interactions between toddlers and caregivers as they learned to play with the new toy. The researchers noted that caregivers from different cultures varied in the number of verbal statements spoken to the children to explain how to play with the toy.",
