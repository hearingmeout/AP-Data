    "description": "A psychologist works with the Temne people of Western Africa. The psychologist presents two equal balls of clay, both an inch in diameter. First, the child acknowledges that the balls of clay are equal. Then, the researcher flattens one of the balls, and the psychologist asks the child, “If your friend was given the clay shaped like a rice cake and you were given the ball, who would have more to eat?” The psychologist counted how many children said, “One of us cannot have more than the other.”",
