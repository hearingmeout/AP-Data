    "description": "Professor Whitmore conducted research to examine changes in cognitive development across the life span. He recruited 400 participants and then grouped them by age. The study included 20-year-olds, 40-year-olds, 60-year-olds, and 80-year-olds (100 in each group). Each group in the study took several different tests. Some of the tests were fact-based and drew upon knowledge from several different areas. Other tests required participants to solve new problems as quickly as they could.",
    "question": "One of Dr. Whitmore’s students had strongly believed that cognitive abilities remained stable throughout the lifespan. When that student read Dr. Whitmore’s research which found that the 60-year-old and 80-year-old groups significantly outperformed the younger groups on test of factual knowledge, he claimed that it was an obvious finding because as you get older you naturally accumulate more knowledge. This student is most clearly exhibiting which of the following?",
