    "description": "By age six months, infants from different countries in the world will distinguish hearing a change in small units of sound. For example, in one study, when six-month old babies hear the RRR sound change to an LLL sound, they sucked faster on a special pacifier that measured their rate of sucking. By twelve months, however, Japanese children no longer distinguish these sounds since culturally, they are not exposed to them.",
