    "question": "Research was conducted on the frequency of accidents involving construction workers being hit by construction vehicles in a work zone. The researchers measured the response of the pedestrians to the volume of warning sounds for each of the vehicles involved in the accidents. The data are depicted in the graph.\n\nWhich of the following principles of learning is demonstrated by the results?",
