    "description": "A researcher wants to see if one’s worldview affects judgments of a crime victim. To do so, she randomly assigns participants to one of three groups. The first group reads a news story about how scientific advances, such as artificial intelligence, are making the world more dangerous. The second group reads a news story about how those same scientific advances are making the world safer. The third group reads a news story about a sports event the previous evening. After reading one of these stories, all participants then read another news story about a man who had been mugged on his way home from work. Participants evaluated the man who was the victim of this crime on a 1 meaning “The man is a really careful person” to 7 meaning “The man is a really careless person.” There were 4 participants in each group.
