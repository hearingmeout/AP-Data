    "description": "In Dr. Hernandez’s study, participants read one of two versions of a story about a student who was preparing for a test. In the first version, the student studied for at least an hour each night for a week before the test. In the second version, the student crammed for an hour or two the night before. After reading the story, participants were given a list of vocabulary words and were told to study for as long as they needed to memorize at least 80% of them. They were then asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how studious they were, with 1 meaning not studious at all and 10 meaning very studious. Dr. Hernandez tracked how long the participants took to study and their response to the questionnaire. The results are given in the table.",
