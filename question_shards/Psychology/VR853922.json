    "question": "Dr. Swan wants to learn if people’s emotional state is related to their ability to think of creative uses for common objects. To do so, she uses surveys to measure people’s current emotional state and then has those people list as many uses as they can think of for a pen, a coffee cup, and a sock. To increase the generalizability of these results, what should Dr. Swan do next?",
