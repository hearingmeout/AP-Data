    "description": "Researchers were interested in the effects of changing work schedules on a variety of behaviors. Employees from several companies who had recently changed from one work shift to another were surveyed. Some of the questions asked employees about day-to-day health-related behaviors such as calorie intake, bedtimes, and minutes spent exercising. Other questions asked the employees to write down what they were thinking about at specific times during the day.",
