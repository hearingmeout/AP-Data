    "description": "At the start of a new semester, a researcher randomly assigns the students in their Social Psychology class to receive a syllabus that either (1) includes positive comments from students who took the class the previous semester, or (2) does not include any comments from students who took the class the previous semester. They look to see how this difference affected scores on the end-of-semester student evaluations of the class among current students, with 1 meaning “unfavorable evaluation” to 5 meaning “favorable evaluation.” The results appear in the graph.",
