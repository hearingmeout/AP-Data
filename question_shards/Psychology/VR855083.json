    "question": "Dr. Drew is doing an experiment in which participants listen to a persuasive speech. They are either told the speaker freely chose to give as speech of their own making or the speaker was given a script and told to read it without the option to choose. If Dr. Drew uses the fundamental attribution error as a theoretical framework, what will their hypothesis be?",
