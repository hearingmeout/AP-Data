    "description": "Dr. Alondra is conducting an experiment to examine the extent to which people make attributions for the heroic actions of others. She obtains 150 participants from her college and has them read one of two fictitious news stories. Each story describes a man who rescued a child from a burning building. However, the characteristics of the man were different for each story. Participants were then asked to rate the likelihood that the man in the story had certain personal attributes from a list provided.",
