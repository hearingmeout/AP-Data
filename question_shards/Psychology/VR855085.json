    "description": "Psychologists showed participants a list of words in a language they did not know. The words were repeated to participants. Group A heard the list 3 times. Group B heard the list 8 times, and Group C heard the list 25 times. Participants rated the degree to which words in the list likely referred to something good or bad. The results provide evidence for the mere exposure effect.",
