    "question": "Jefferson High School is interested in a relationship between students’ beliefs about their own abilities and their grades in math classes. To investigate the relationship, the four calculus instructors give out a survey on the first day of class. Students place their name at the top of the survey. They answer five questions regarding whether successes and failures in their life are due to their own abilities or the product of chance. At the end of the term, student survey scores are compared to final grades.\nWhich of the following represents a flaw in this procedure?",
