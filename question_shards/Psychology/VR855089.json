    "description": "A social psychologist selects five high schools from a midwestern state. He then uses a sports team roster from each school to randomly select 10 players to participate in a study. Each selected player is first asked to list as many positive personality and athletic characteristics for the other players on her own team as they can. Then they are asked to list as many positive personality and athletic characteristics for the players on a rival team. Each player is given 15 minutes to complete each task. The distribution of scores is presented in the graphs.",
