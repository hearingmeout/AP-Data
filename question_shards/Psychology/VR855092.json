    "question": "Student Survey Totals Pre-Course\n Student Survey Totals Post-Course\n\nStudent agreement with the issues\n 62\n 65\n\nProfessor Patel gives an anonymous survey of 100 questions to each of his students on the first day of his course to measure student attitudes about social issues. The higher the scores on the survey, the more the students agree with the issues. During the term, students are given a reading assignment or video lecture about each issue at least twice, using studies sourced by reputable professional organizations. The data from these studies often contradicted the issues presented in the surveys. The surveys were given again at the end of the course to see if student attitudes about the social issues changed.\n\nWhich of the following best explains the data from the table?",
