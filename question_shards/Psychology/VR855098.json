    "question": "Cheyenne will soon have a baby and is trying to decide whether to have the baby at home or in a hospital. It is common in Cheyenne’s family for the eldest womens’ opinions to be respected above all other factors. Her mother and her aunt inform Cheyenne that having a baby in the hospital is best because if something goes wrong during the birth, the staff can assist more easily with all the medical equipment that is available in a hospital. Before speaking with her mother and her aunt, Cheyenne originally felt that the hospital was the best place to have the baby. Now, after her discussion with her mother and her aunt, she feels even more convinced about her decision to have the baby in the hospital.\nWhich concept best explains Cheyenne’s desire to do what her aunt and mother suggest?",
