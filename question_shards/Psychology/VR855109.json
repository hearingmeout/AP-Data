    "question": "A group of 10 graduate students conducted a study about the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli and diagnosis of disorders. Randomly selected and informed participants met with a licensed psychotherapist for a clinical evaluation. Participants were then shown an ambiguous image of a scene depicting either 2, 4, or 6 people and asked to explain what was going on in the picture. All sessions were videotaped and shown to each of the 10 members of the research team, who independently diagnosed the participants based on their interpretations of the image.\nWhich of the following describes the operational definition of the independent variable?",
