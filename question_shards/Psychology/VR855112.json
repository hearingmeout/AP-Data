    "description": "Dr. Segal has been studying 100 sets of identical twins that had been separated at birth. Before reuniting the identical twins, Dr. Segal gave each twin a personality inventory that measured the Big Five trait of extraversion. Dr. Segal found that, despite being raised in completely different environments, the twins had very similar extraversion scores.",
