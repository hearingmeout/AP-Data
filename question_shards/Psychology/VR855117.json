    "description": "Ms. Templeton was interested in people’s preferences for athletic events and activities in high schools. She recruited 50 participants from 10 sporting events and 10 after-school activities. She presented each person with a list of choices. They were asked to select the activity or athletic event they preferred from the list. Subjects were then asked to rate the difficulty of their decisions on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being very difficult. She determined that those who rated their difficulty as a 4 or a 5 experienced an approach-approach conflict, because they found difficulty choosing between two preferred options.",
