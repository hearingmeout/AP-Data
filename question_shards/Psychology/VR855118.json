    "description": "Mr. Anton, who is interested in arousal theory, wanted to measure the effect that stressful environments have on the quality of food prepared in a restaurant kitchen. On the same night of the week for three consecutive weeks, he asks the kitchen staff at his favorite restaurant to cook the same menu but under different environmental conditions. In week one, the staff work in a kitchen while soft soothing music is played. In week two, upbeat pop music is played. And in week three, experimental music that uses loud, banging trash cans as instruments is played. Mr. Anton has the diners, who cannot hear the music playing in the kitchen, rate the quality of the dishes for each night.",
