    "question": "A high school is looking to determine if students are motivated to do well in school for internal or external reasons. Fifty students are randomly selected from the school and given a twenty-question survey. The questions are written as statements and students respond on a scale of 1-5 where 1 means “never me” and 5 means “always me.” Half of the questions are from an intrinsic perspective, and the other half from an extrinsic perspective.\nWhich of the following best describes the data collected for this study?",
