    "description": "Dr. Cabello is studying how much pressure people need to perform at their best. She created a survey that asks volunteer participants from the college where she works how stressful they find different kinds of stimuli. The survey uses a scale starting at 1 which means they find the stimulus not stressful at all and ends at 5 which means they find the stimulus extremely stressful. She then collects their overall grade point average data and compares their survey ratings to their grade point averages.",
