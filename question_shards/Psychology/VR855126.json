    "question": "Peyton had never felt romantically attracted to her coworker Antoni before because they have very little in common and his sense of humor usually annoys her. However, after attending an exciting, energetic party with Antoni, where they danced and ate good food, Peyton began feeling strong positive emotions every time he was near her. She began to think it might be fun to go out with him.\nWhat psychological principle can best explain the situation?",
