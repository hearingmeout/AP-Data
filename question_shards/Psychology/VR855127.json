    "description": "Angelica is touring colleges to determine where she will continue her education. Most of the campuses offered a tour with college students showing the high school students around various locations on the campus, including dorms and academic buildings. However, the last campus she visited had fun activities that sparked positive emotions in Angelica, rather than offering a tour. She decided on this final school because it would be a place where she could continue to grow as a person as well as increase academics.",
