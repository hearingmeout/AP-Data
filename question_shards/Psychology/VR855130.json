    "description": "Dr. Yankovic is interested in whether humans display more anger on their faces when they are alone or with others. Subjects were told that the purpose of the experiment was to evaluate different personality traits using a personality inventory. However, the true purpose of the study was to expose subjects to a frustrating situation in which the personality inventory they are filling out keeps restarting and their information does not save. Subjects’ faces are closely monitored in the alone condition and in the with others condition to see whether subjects display more anger when alone or with others.",
