    "question": "Survey\n Pre-training Mean (Standard deviation in parentheses)\n Post-training Mean (Standard deviation in parentheses)\n\nHope\n 42 (7.2)\n 58 (8.3)\n\nLife Satisfaction\n 19 (5.5)\n 24 (6.2)\n\nDepression\n 66 (4.6)\n 31 (2.8)\n\nAnxiety\n 63 (5.2)\n 32 (3.2)\n\nNote: High scores on Hope and Life Satisfaction indicate increase. Low scores on Depression and Anxiety indicate decrease.\n\nA university professor wanted to see if providing positive psychology training would affect students’ cognitions. The professor assessed the students’ cognitive perceptions in four specific areas. The results are listed in the table. Which statement accurately describes the variable with the largest spread of scores around the mean for the post-training set of scores?",
