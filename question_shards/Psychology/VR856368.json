Use the three sources provided to answer all parts of the question.\nFor part B and part C, you must cite the source that you used to answer the question. You can do this in two different ways: \n\n• Parenthetical Citation:\n\nFor example: “. . . (Source <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>)”\n\n• Embedded Citation:\n\nFor example: “According to Source <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, . . .”\n\nSource 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this study, researchers examined the impact of daily gratitude practices on reported happiness among persons with neuromuscular disease.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe sample consisted of <math alttext=\"65\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>65</mn></math> people (<math alttext=\"44\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>44</mn></math> women, <math alttext=\"21\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>21</mn></math> men) with a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control voluntary muscles and the nerves that communicate sensory information back to the brain. The participants ranged in age from <math alttext=\"22\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>22</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"77\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>77</mn></math> years, with a mean age of <math alttext=\"49\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>49</mn></math> years. Participants were recruited through a mailing list compiled by the researcher’s institution.\n\nMethod\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned one of two conditions: a gratitude condition (<math alttext=\"33\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>33</mn></math> participants) and a control condition (<math alttext=\"32\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>32</mn></math> participants). Both groups completed daily ratings of their subjective well-being. However, participants in the gratitude condition were also asked to respond to the following prompt:\n\nThere are many things in our lives, both large and small, that we might be grateful about. Think back over the past day and write down up to five things in your life that you are grateful or thankful for.\n\nParticipants were provided with a packet of <math alttext=\"21\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>21</mn></math> daily experience rating forms and envelopes for mailing their forms directly back to the researchers. They were instructed to fill out the form as close to the end of the day as possible. They were told that their ratings were meant to summarize the day as a whole. The daily form took approximately <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> minutes to complete each evening. Participants were asked to mail in their forms once a week and were paid <math alttext=\"20 dollars\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>$</mo><mn>20</mn></math> if they completed all the forms.\n\nThe “daily experience rating forms” measured subjective well-being in three ways:\n\nParticipants were asked to rate how they felt about their life as a whole on a <math alttext=\"negative 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"positive 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math> scale, with <math alttext=\"negative 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></math> meaning terrible and <math alttext=\"positive 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math> meaning delighted.\n\nParticipants rated their expectations for the upcoming week, also on a <math alttext=\"negative 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"positive 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math> scale, with <math alttext=\"negative 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></math> meaning pessimistic, expect the worst and <math alttext=\"positive 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math> labeled optimistic, expect the best.\n\nParticipants indicated how connected they felt with others (where <math alttext=\"negative 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> isolated and <math alttext=\"positive 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> well-connected).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nParticipants in the gratitude condition reported more satisfaction with their lives as a whole, felt more optimism about the upcoming week, and felt more connected with others than did participants in the control condition. Mean ratings for each measure are reported in the table.\n\nComparisons of Groups by Measures of Subjective Well-Being\n\nDependent Variable\n Gratitude\n Control\n\nLife as whole\n <math alttext=\"1.54\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>54</mn></math>\n <math alttext=\"0.80\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>80</mn></math>\n\nUpcoming week\n <math alttext=\"1.70\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>70</mn></math>\n <math alttext=\"1.20\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>20</mn></math>\n\nConnected with others\n <math alttext=\"1.77\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>77</mn></math>\n <math alttext=\"1.07\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>07</mn></math>\n\nThe differences between the groups were statistically significant for each of the three measures.\nEmmons, R.

Comparing levels of similarity between identical and fraternal twins in the sample allowed researchers to investigate the intent to which genetic factors influence happiness.\n\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were <math alttext=\"2,310\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>310</mn></math> members of a large twin registry who were born between <math alttext=\"1936\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1936</mn></math> and <math alttext=\"1955\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1955</mn></math>. The twins provide a representative sample of the population of Minnesota, which was predominantly White at the time (fewer than <math alttext=\"2%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of Minnesota births were to African or Native Americans during this period). Their socioeconomic levels were representative of Minnesota-born adults.\n\nMethod\n\nA self-rating questionnaire was administered to all participants. One of the questionnaire items read, “Taking the good with the bad, how happy and contented are you on the average now, compared with other people?” The twins were asked to make their ratings on a <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math>-point scale: <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> the lowest of the population, <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> the lower, <math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> the middle, <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> the upper, and <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>=</mo></math> the highest.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nMost of the participants exhibited considerable contentment, and no substantial differences were found between male and female subjects. As shown in Graph <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, <math alttext=\"86%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>86</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of the twins rated themselves in the top <math alttext=\"35%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>35</mn><mo>%</mo></math> in overall contentment.\n\nGraph <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>: Contentment Self-Ratings\n\nResearchers found that one twin’s score on a measure of subjective well-being was predictive of the second twin’s score, but only for identical twins. Fraternal twins’ scores did not correlate with each other. This was true both for twin pairs raised together and for twin pairs who had been raised apart.\n\nTable : Correlations on contentment for middle-age twins reared together and reared apart\n\nType of Twin Pair\n Correlation Coefficient\n\nTwins reared together\n\nIdentical\n <math alttext=\"positive 0.44\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>44</mn></math>\n\nFraternal\n <math alttext=\"positive 0.08\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>08</mn></math>\n\nTwins reared apart\n\nIdentical\n <math alttext=\"positive 0.52\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>52</mn></math>\n\nFraternal\n <math alttext=\"negative 0.02\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>02</mn></math>\n\nThe reported well-being of one’s identical twin is a better predictor of one’s self-rated happiness than is one’s own educational attainment, income, or status. Based on the correlations indicated above in Table <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math>, researchers estimate the heritability of subjective well-being to be nearly <math alttext=\"80%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>80</mn><mo>%</mo></math>.\nLykken, D. & Tellegen, A.

Of the approximately <math alttext=\"1,200\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>200</mn></math> employees, <math alttext=\"88\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>88</mn></math> (<math alttext=\"72.7%\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>72</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>%</mo></math> female) participated in the study. Participants’ ages ranged from <math alttext=\"22\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>22</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"55\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>55</mn></math>, and they worked in a variety of departments across the company. They were given both a prize of university merchandise and a donation to a charitable organization based on enrollment in the study.\n\nMethod\n\nAll participants were told that they would be practicing a potentially happiness-boosting activity over a number of weeks. They were informed that a computer would randomly assign them to an activity, that it might change from week to week, and that some would not be assigned any activity for the duration of the study. Participants were instructed to keep their activities confidential and focus only on completing their assignments to the best of their abilities.\n\nParticipants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: Givers (<math alttext=\"19\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>19</mn></math> participants), Receivers (<math alttext=\"35\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>35</mn></math> participants) and Controls (<math alttext=\"34\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>34</mn></math> participants). No participants were aware of their group assignment. Thus, Receivers were not aware that Givers had been assigned to do acts of kindness on their behalf.\n\nGivers were instructed to perform five acts of kindness in one day for recipients on a specific list. They were allowed to choose the specific kinds of activities they did, when they performed them, and whom they chose from their randomized lists of Receivers. Some examples were provided to help them select activities, such as “bringing someone a beverage” or “emailing a thank-you note.” This process was repeated each week for the four weeks of the study, and each Giver was provided a new list of Receivers to select from during each week. Neither Receivers nor Controls performed any other activity assignments throughout the study.\n\nAll participants logged into the study website every week for <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math> weeks to complete surveys that measured happiness and life satisfaction, depression symptoms, and job satisfaction. In a follow-up measure, participants repeated these surveys one month after the acts of kindness assignments had been completed.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nResults indicated that both Givers and Receivers benefited from the intervention. At the one-month follow-up, Givers showed statistically significant increases in life satisfaction and job satisfaction and decreases in depressive symptoms. Increases in happiness measures were also observed in Givers, though they were not statistically significant. Receivers showed increases in happiness that were statistically significant.\n\nA full month after Givers finished practicing their acts of kindness, the long-term benefits remained, and they were strongest for Givers themselves. The study’s results indicate that acts of kindness produce improvements in well-being for both Givers and Receivers, though Givers benefit more. Results are depicted in the graphs.\n\nHappiness Ratings Across <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> Weeks\n\nLife Satisfaction Ratings Across <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> Weeks\n\nDepressive Symptoms Ratings Across <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> Weeks\n\nJob Satisfaction Ratings Across <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> Weeks\n\nChancellor, J., Margolis, S., Jacobs Bao, K., & Lyubomirsky, S.
