Write the response to each part of the question in complete sentences. Use appropriate psychological terminology in your response.\n\nSource\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Stanley Milgram, a psychologist at Yale University, led a series of studies that tested whether people would obey the commands of a researcher in a lab. The study presented is a replication of one of Milgram’s original studies.\n\nParticipants\n\nIndividuals who responded to advertisements and flyers went through a series of screening procedures to eliminate people who had taken more than two psychology courses in college; been diagnosed with, or had therapy for, a psychological disorder; abused alcohol or drugs; had medical conditions affected by stress; or experienced severe trauma. The final sample had 29 men and 41 women. The participants ranged in age from 20 to 81 (mean age = 42.9 years, standard deviation = 15.67, median age = 41). Participant education and race/ethnicity demographics are presented in the table.\n\nEducation and Ethnicity\n Number of Participants\n Percentage of Participants\n\nEducation\n\nHigh school or less\n 12\n 17.1\n\nSome college\n 16\n 22.9\n\nBachelor’s degree\n 28\n 40.0\n\nMaster’s degree\n 14\n 20.0\n\nEthnicity\n\nWhite\n 38\n 54.3\n\nAsian\n 19\n 26.7\n\nLatino/a/Hispanic\n 9\n 12.9\n\nAfrican American\n 3\n 4.3\n\nDid not state\n 1\n 1.4\n\nA committee of professionals reviewed the study to ensure the appropriateness of the study before researchers began.\n\nMethod\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the “base” condition and the “modeled refusal” condition. The participants agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw at any time and keep the $50 they were paid to participate.\n\nIn the base condition, the participant was paired with a “learner,” who was a research confederate. The participant read 25 different word-pairs (e.g., strong–arm) that the “learner” had to recall. If the “learner” gave an incorrect answer, the participant administered an electric shock using a “shock generator” that had switches ranging from 15 to 450 volts in 15-volt increments. The shock was fake, but the participant did not know this. The. The participant moved up one switch on the shock generator for each incorrect answer.\n\nWhile the participants watched, the researcher strapped the “learners” into a chair with electrodes. The participant then went to another room for the remainder of the study. The “learners” gave correct and incorrect responses according to a predetermined schedule. After participants pressed the 75-volt switch, they heard a small grunt from the “learner.” The grunts got louder after each successive shock. When a participant pressed the 150-volt switch, the “learner” yelled, “Ugh. Get me out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart’s starting to bother me now. I refuse to go on. Let me out.”\n\nIf the participant expressed reluctance or hesitation at any time, the researcher gave one of four directions, in this order: “Please continue”; “The research requires that you continue”; “It is absolutely essential that you continue”; and “You have no other choice, you must continue.” The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The base condition ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.\n\nIn the modeled refusal condition, the procedures were the same as the base condition except for an additional confederate who was paired with each participant. The men were paired with a White man in his 50s. Women were paired with a White woman in her late 20s. The researcher pretended to randomly choose the participant to be Teacher 2 and the additional confederate to be Teacher 1. Teacher 1 administered shocks to the “learner” according to the procedures as the participant watched. At the 90-volt shock level, Teacher 1 said to the researcher, “I don’t know about this.” The researcher responded with “Please continue.” Teacher 1 paused and then said, “I don’t think I can do this,” and pushed their chair from the table. The researcher then asked Teacher 2 (the participant) to continue the test, picking up where Teacher 1 left off.\n\nAs with the base condition, if the participant (Teacher 2) expressed reluctance or hesitation, the researcher gave one of the four directions as described. The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The modeled refusal condition also ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.\n\nWhen the study was over, the researcher explained informed participants of the true purpose of the study after the study was complete, specifically that the “learner” was not receiving electric shocks. The “learner” entered the lab room at that point to assure the participant that they were fine.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nNumber (and Percentages) of Participants Who Stopped and Who Continued\n\nBehavior\n Base Condition\n Modeled Refusal Condition\n Milgram’s Original Study\n\nStopped at 150 volts or earlier\n 12 (30%)\n 11 (36.7%)\n 7 (17.5%)\n\nContinued after 150 volts\n 28 (70%)\n 19 (63.3%)\n 33 (82.5%)\n\nNumbers (and Percentages) of Participants Who Stopped and Who Continued, By Gender\n\nCondition and Behavior\n Men\n Women\n\nBase condition\n\nStopped at 150 volts or earlier\n 6 (33.3%)\n 6 (27.3%)\n\nContinued after 150 volts\n 12 (66.7%)\n 16 (72.7%)\n\nModeled Refusal Condition\n\nStopped at 150 volts or earlier\n 5 (45.5%)\n 6 (31.6%)\n\nContinued after 150 volts\n 6 (54.5%)\n 13 (68.4%)\n\nBurger, J.M.
