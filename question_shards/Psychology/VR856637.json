    "question": "A psychologist is devising a research study to test the diathesis-stress model. She gathers a list of interested subjects who have one or more members of their family who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. She randomly assigns the subjects to one of two groups and identifies them with a code number to maintain confidentiality. The experimental group will be subjected to a series of stress-inducing situations while the control group will be allowed to read books, engage in quiet conversation, and relax. The psychologist then proposes to follow the subjects for six years.\nWhich of the following is most likely of concern for an IRB to consider whether the psychologist followed appropriate ethical procedures?",
