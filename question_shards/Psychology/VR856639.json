    "question": "Dr. Mizrahi is designing a study to test whether antidepressants are more effective than placebos. Using electronic medical records, Dr. Mizrahi gathers a random sample of his patients who display a set of symptoms typically associated with major depressive disorder. He randomly assigns participants to receive an antidepressant medication or a placebo as a substitute for their daily multivitamin. Neither the participants nor Dr. Mizrahi know who is in which group.\nWhich of the following should be of concern when trying to evaluate whether Dr. Mizrahi adhered to established ethical research guidelines?",

      {

      {
        "label": "Since a double-blind procedure was used, it is of ethical concern that Dr. Mizrahi does not know which group is getting the placebo.",

        "label": "Although there is debate about the use of deception in placebo studies, it is an ethical concern that deception was used in this case.",
