    "question": "Sports psychologists are studying the use of rational-emotive behavior therapy on the understanding and promotion of mental health in athletes. Once they have received informed consent, the researchers split the athletes into two groups. The experimental group was shown a series of videos in which athletes were injured and then were given rational-emotive behavior therapy to discuss what they viewed. The control group did not watch any videos and received conventional positive thinking training. Which of the following would most likely be of most concern for the IRB reviewing this study?",
