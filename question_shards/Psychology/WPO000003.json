    "description": "Introduction\n\nResearchers performed a study to determine if cell phone calls that interrupt in-person interactions between a mother and her child affect how well the child learns vocabulary words.\n\nParticipants\n\nThis study comprised 38 pairs of participants. Each pair comprised a mother and her two-year-old child. The average age of the mothers was 35.26 years (age range = 29.53 to 47.10 years; 19 mothers did not report their age). All the two-year-old children were developing along standard physical, social, and emotional timelines. The average age of the children was 27.05 months (2.25 years), and an equal number of boys and girls participated. All mother-child pairs lived in suburban communities surrounding the same major East Coast United States city; 90.9% of families self-identified as white while the remaining 9.10% self-identified as Hispanic, Pacific Islander, African American, or multiethnic.1 Mothers agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw from participation at any time. Researchers ensured that the individual participants could not be identified from the data collected.\n\nMethod\n\nAt the beginning of the study, mothers and their children were placed in separate rooms. The children played in a supervised, child-friendly room. Meanwhile, in a separate room, the researchers trained the mothers regarding the meaning of two completely new words: blicking (meaning a type of bouncing) and frepping (meaning a type of shaking). The researchers made up these words and their meanings for the purpose of this study. To demonstrate blicking to their child, each mother was provided an 18-inch gender-neutral2 doll. To demonstrate frepping to their child, each mother could shake a 6-inch rattle. \n\nAfter providing each mother with a phone, which had been set to vibrate mode, the researchers trained each mother on how to answer the phone. The researchers told each mother to expect occasional phone calls during the study. During each call, the researchers provided one of three directions to the mother: 1) begin teaching the new word (teaching phase), 2) move to the next word (transition phase), or 3) engage in a conversation with the researcher as if talking with a friend (interruption phase). \n\nTo initiate the teaching phase, the researchers called each mother and told her to teach the designated word to her child. Half of the mothers were told to teach blicking first while the other half were told to teach frepping first. The researchers interrupted half of the mothers while the mothers taught their first word and then interrupted the second half of the mothers while the mothers taught their second word. For the uninterrupted teaching phase, each mother received a transition call from a researcher that instructed her to start teaching the identified word. The mother then had 60 seconds to teach the word to her child. \n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 depict the research design for the teaching phase, the transition phase, and the interruption phase. \n\nFigure 1: Teaching Sequence in Interruption-First Condition\n\nThe teaching time for Word 1 and Word 2 and interruption call times are shown as follows:\n\nWord 1 (30 seconds)\n\nInterruption Call (30 seconds)\n\nWord 1 (30 seconds)\n\nTransition Call (5–7 seconds)\n\nWord 2 (60 seconds)\n\nFigure 2: Teaching Sequence in Interruption-Second Condition\n\nThe teaching time for Word 1 and Word 2 and interruption call times are shown as follows:\n\nWord 1 (60 seconds)\n\nTransition Call (5–7 seconds)\n\nWord 2 (30 seconds)\n\nInterruption Call (30 seconds)\n\nWord 2 (30 seconds)\n\nFor each interrupted teaching phase, the mother received a call after 30 seconds of teaching her child. During the interrupted teaching phase, the researchers and the mother talked about morning coffee routines for about 30 seconds. After about 30 seconds, the researchers instructed the mother to continue teaching her child the assigned word. Each mother had an additional 30 seconds to teach the word.\n\nThe researchers counted how many times the mothers used the words blicking or frepping during the instruction sessions.\n\nAfter receiving instruction on blicking and frepping, each child sat in their mother’s lap and watched a video. The video began with an attention-getting image in the center of the screen (an image of a laughing baby) followed by the instruction to “Find [blicking or frepping].” The video then transitioned to a scene in which a puppet demonstrated the appropriate action for each word (bouncing for blicking and shaking for frepping) or demonstrated an unrelated action (twisting side to side or putting a hand on a box while standing up). Researchers measured how long the children paid attention to the action in the video to determine whether the children learned blicking or frepping. The mothers closed their eyes during the video to avoid accidentally cueing the children to pay attention to the correct action in the video. Researchers informed participants of the true purpose of the study after the study was complete.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nOn average, the mothers repeated the word approximately 24 times in the interrupted teaching phase and approximately 20 times in the uninterrupted teaching phase. The difference was not statistically significant. \n\nThe children paid attention to the word they learned in the uninterrupted session for an average of 0.63 seconds and in the interrupted session for an average of 0.50 seconds. The difference in means was statistically significant, suggesting that in-person interruptions between parent and child can affect how well young children learn vocabulary words.\n\nReed.
