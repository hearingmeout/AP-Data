    "description": "When Rowan was six years old, his father took him to see a tennis match. Rowan enjoyed learning the rules of the game and watching the players hit the ball back and forth across the net with their tennis racquets. \nFive months later, Rowan’s aunt took him to a park to play pickleball, a game similar to tennis. He had a great afternoon learning to hit the ball back and forth with the pickleball paddle instead of a tennis racquet. That night, Rowan told his parents that he had a great time playing “tennis” with his aunt.",
