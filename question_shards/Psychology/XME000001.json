    "description": "Dr. Xiang examined a 21-year-old patient who had fallen and hit their head. After a brain scan was conducted, Dr. Xiang discovered that the patient was missing their cerebellum. Dr. Xiang extensively interviewed the patient and their family and learned that the patient had a long history of balance and coordination problems. \nBased on this patient, Dr. Xiang tells her colleague that anyone who is missing their cerebellum will always experience balance and coordination problems.",
