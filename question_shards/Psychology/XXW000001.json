    "description": "In his psychology class, Keenan was learning about the various ways people respond to and cope with stressful life events. While he believed that both men and women dealt with stress in the same way, his teacher explained that women are much more likely than men to reach out to friends to both give and receive support. Upon learning this, Keenan told a classmate this finding was totally predictable and obvious because women are typically more nurturing than men.",
