    "description": "Researchers at an advertising agency conducted a study to determine whether classical conditioning principles could influence consumers' preferences for a particular product. They randomly assigned 100 college students from a nearby university to one of two groups. \n\nBoth groups watched a commercial for the same brand of shoes. One group watched a commercial that did not feature a celebrity endorsement, while the second group watched a commercial that featured a celebrity endorsement from a physically attractive celebrity. The participants were exposed to these ads multiple times a day for two weeks. \n\nAt the end of the two weeks, the participants were asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, how likely they were to purchase the brand of shoes advertised in the commercial they watched.",
