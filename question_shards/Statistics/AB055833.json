    "description": "Researchers will conduct an experiment to compare the effectiveness of two brands of shampoo—Brand X and Brand Y. They will use a matched-pairs design in which each participant will use one brand for one week and then the other brand for one week. For each participant, the researchers will randomly assign which shampoo, Brand X or Brand Y, will be used first, and <math alttext=\"15\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> milliliters of shampoo will be used for each hair wash. Because the temperature of the water is known to have an effect, a water temperature less than <math alttext=\"100 degrees Fahrenheit\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>F</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> will be used for the first week and a water temperature greater than <math alttext=\"100 degrees Fahrenheit\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi>°</mi><mtext>F</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> will be used for the second week. At the end of each week, the effectiveness of the shampoo being used will be measured.",
