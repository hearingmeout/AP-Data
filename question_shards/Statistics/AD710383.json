    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Regulations require that product labels on containers of food that are available for sale to the public accurately state the amount of food in those containers. Specifically, if milk containers are labeled to have 128 fluid ounces and the mean number of fluid ounces of milk in the containers is at least 128, the milk processor is considered to be in compliance with the regulations. The filling machines can be set to the labeled amount. Variability in the filling process causes the actual contents of milk containers to be normally distributed. A random sample of 12 containers of milk was drawn from the milk processing line in a plant, and the amount of milk in each container was recorded. (a) The sample mean and standard deviation of this sample of 12 containers of milk were 127.2 ounces and 2.1 ounces, respectively. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the packaging plant is not in compliance with the regulations? Provide statistical justification for your answer. Inspectors decide to study a particular filling machine within this plant further. For this machine, the amount of milk in the containers has a mean of 128.0 fluid ounces and a standard deviation of 2.0 fluid ounces. (b) What is the probability that a randomly selected container filled by this machine contains at least 125 fluid ounces? (c) An inspector will randomly select 12 containers filled by this machine and record the amount of milk in each. What is the probability that the minimum (smallest amount of milk) recorded in the 12 containers will be at least 125 fluid ounces? (Note: In order for the minimum to be at least 125 fluid ounces, each of the 12 containers must contain at least 125 fluid ounces.) An analyst wants to use simulation to investigate the sampling distribution of the minimum. This analyst randomly generates 150 samples, each consisting of 12 observations, from a normal distribution with mean 128 and standard deviation 2 and finds the minimum for each sample. The 150 minimums (sorted from smallest to largest) are shown on the next page. (d) Use the simulation results to estimate the probability that was requested in part (c) and compare this estimate with the theoretical value you calculated.",
