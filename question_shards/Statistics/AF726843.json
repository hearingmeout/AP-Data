    "description": "Biologists conducted a study to investigate the flying velocity of mosquitoes both before and after feeding. The following scatterplot shows the velocity after feeding, in centimeters per second, and the proportional increase in weight after feeding relative to the weight before feeding. For example, 0.5 indicates a 50 percent weight gain after feeding. One point on the graph is labeled <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
    "question": "What is unusual about point <math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>?",
