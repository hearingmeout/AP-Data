    "question": "A certain store has 3,000 employees working at its main location in a city and 100 employees working at a smaller location outside the city. The store manager will select a sample of 50 employees from all the employees to ask their opinions about extending store hours during the holidays. What is the advantage of selecting a stratified random sample, with location as strata, instead of a simple random sample?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The stratified sample assures the most random selection from among all selection methods.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The stratified sample assures that the opinions of employees from both locations will be represented.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The stratified sample will be less expensive to implement than a simple random sample and will save money over time.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The stratified sample assures employees that store hours will not be extended until their opinions are recorded.",

      },
      {
        "label": "There is no real advantage to stratifying because a simple random sample is always the best.",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "The stratified sample assures that the opinions of employees from both locations will be represented."
