    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. A French study was conducted in the 1990s to compare the effectiveness of using an instrument called a cardiopump with the effectiveness of using traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in saving lives of heart attack victims. Heart attack patients in participating cities were treated with either a cardiopump or CPR, depending on whether the individual’s heart attack occurred on an even-numbered or an odd-numbered day of the month. Before the start of the study, a coin was tossed to determine which treatment, a cardiopump or CPR, was given on the even-numbered days. The other treatment was given on the odd-numbered days. In total, 754 patients were treated with a cardiopump, and 37 survived at least one year; while 746 patients were treated with CPR, and 15 survived at least one year. The conditions for inference are satisfied in the study. State the conditions and indicate how they are satisfied. Perform a statistical test to determine whether the survival rate for patients treated with a cardiopump is significantly higher than the survival rate for patients treated with CPR.",
