    "description": "The quality-control manager of a large factory is concerned about the number of defective items produced by workers. Thirty workers at the factory agree to participate in a study of three different incentive plans to help reduce the number of defective items produced. The plans will be randomly assigned to the workers so that 10 workers received each plan. The reduction in the number of defective items produced by each worker will be recorded two weeks after the plans are implemented.",
    "question": "Which of the following best describes why a completely randomized design is an appropriate design to use in this situation?",
