    "description": "A penalty kick in soccer involves two players from different teams, the shooter and the goalie. During the penalty kick the shooter will try to score a goal by kicking a soccer ball to the left or right of the goal area. To prevent the shooter from scoring a goal, the goalie will move to the left or right of the goal area. The following table summarizes the directions taken by the shooter and the goalie for 372 penalty kicks.",
