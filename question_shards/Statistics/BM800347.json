    "description": "A recent report indicated that 90 percent of adults in a certain region actively try to include vegetables in their diet. A simulation was conducted that consisted of 50 trials with a population parameter of 0.9. Each trial consisted of a sample size of 10. The number of successes out of 10 was recorded, where success represented an adult trying to include vegetables in the diet.",
    "question": "Five possible simulation results are shown. Which simulation is the best match to the one described?",
