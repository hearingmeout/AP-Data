    "question": "A complex electronic device contains three components, A, B, and C. The probabilities of failure for each component in any one year are 0.01, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively. If any one component fails, the device will fail. If the components fail independently of one another, what is the probability that the device will not fail in one year?",
