    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. In search of a mosquito repellent that is safer than the ones that are currently on the market, scientists have developed a new compound that is rated as less toxic than the current compound, thus making a repellent that contains this new compound safer for human use. Scientists also believe that a repellent containing the new compound will be more effective than the ones that contain the current compound. To test the effectiveness of the new compound versus that of the current compound, scientists have randomly selected 100 people from a state. Up to 100 bins, with an equal number of mosquitoes in each bin, are available for use in the study. After a compound is applied to a participant’s forearm, the participant will insert his or her forearm into a bin for 1 minute, and the number of mosquito bites on the arm at the end of that time will be determined. Suppose this study is to be conducted using a completely randomized design. Describe a randomization process and identify an inference procedure for the study. Suppose this study is to be conducted using a matched-pairs design. Describe a randomization process and identify an inference procedure for the study. Which of the designs, the one in part (a) or the one in part (b), is better for testing the effectiveness of the new compound versus that of the current compound? Justify your answer.",
