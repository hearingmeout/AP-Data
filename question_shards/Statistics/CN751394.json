    "question": "Carly commutes to work, and her commute time is dependent on the weather. When the weather is good, the distribution of her commute times is approximately normal with mean 20 minutes and standard deviation 2 minutes. When the weather is not good, the distribution of her commute times is approximately normal with mean 30 minutes and standard deviation 4 minutes. Suppose the probability that the weather will be good tomorrow is 0.9. Which of the following is closest to the probability that Carly’s commute time tomorrow will be greater than 25 minutes?",
