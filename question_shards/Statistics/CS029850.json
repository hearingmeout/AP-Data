    "description": "A paint manufacturer conducted an experiment to investigate whether a new formula produces paint that lasts longer on the exterior of a building than paint produced using an older formula. A grid of <math alttext=\"20\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> squares was drawn on one side of an exterior wall of a building. The new formula was randomly assigned to <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> squares, and the older formula was assigned to the remaining <math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> squares. Each square was painted with the assigned formula. One year later, each square was rated on how well the paint had lasted, using a numerical scale for which larger values indicated longer-lasting paint.",
