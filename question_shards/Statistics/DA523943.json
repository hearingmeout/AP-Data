Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. A random sample of 200 students was selected from a large college in the United States. Each selected student was asked to give his or her opinion about the following statement. “The most important quality of a person who aspires to be the President of the United States is a knowledge of foreign affairs.” Each response was recorded in one of five categories. The gender of each selected student was noted. The data are summarized in the table below. Is there sufficient evidence to indicate that the response is dependent on gender? Provide statistical evidence to support your conclusion.",
