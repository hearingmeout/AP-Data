    "question": "A river runs through a certain city and divides the city into two parts, west and east. The population proportion of residents in the west who are in favor of building a new bridge across the river is known to be <math alttext=\"p sub W equals 0.30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>.

Two random samples of city residents of size 50, one sample from the west and one sample from the east, were taken to investigate opinions on the bridge, where <math alttext=\"p hat sub W equals 0.38\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mover><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>^</mo></mrow></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.38</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> and <math alttext=\"p hat sub E equals 0.25\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mover><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>^</mo></mrow></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.25</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the sample proportions. For samples of size 50 from each population, which of the following is the best interpretation of the mean of the sampling distribution of the difference in the sample proportions (west minus east) of residents from the west and east who are in favor of building the bridge?",
