Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. A survey given to a random sample of students at a university included a question about which of two well-known comedy shows, S or F, students preferred. The students were asked the question, “Do you prefer S or F ?” The responses are shown below. Based on the results of this survey, construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students in the population who would respond S to the question, “Do you prefer S or F ?” What is the meaning of “95% confidence” in part (a) ? In a follow-up survey, a separate group of randomly selected students was asked “Do you prefer F or S ?”The responses are shown below. Based on these two surveys, is there evidence that the stated preference depends on the order in which the comedy shows were listed in the survey question? Justify your answer. Suppose the test in part (c) indicates that the order in which the shows were listed does make a difference.
