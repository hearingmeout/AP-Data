    "question": "According to a survey about how workers get to work in Wyoming, 77 percent of workers get to work by driving alone, 11 percent get to work by carpooling, 4 percent get to work by walking, and 8 percent get to work by other means of transportation. Suppose a sample of 200 Wyoming workers is selected at random. Let the random variable <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of workers in the sample who get to work by driving alone. What is the expected value of <math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> ?",
