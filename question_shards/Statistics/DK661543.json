    "question": "In the states of Florida and Colorado, veterinarians investigating obesity in dogs obtained random samples of pet medical records and recorded the weights of the dogs in the samples. A test was conducted of H0 : p1 = p2 versus Ha : p1 ≠ p2, where p1 represents the proportion of all overweight dogs in Florida and p2 represents the proportion of all overweight dogs in Colorado. The resulting test statistic for a two-sample z-test for a difference between proportions was 1.85. At the significance level α = 0.05, which of the following is a correct conclusion?",
