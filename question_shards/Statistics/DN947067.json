    "description": "Hannah wanted to investigate whether there was a difference in the time spent in the checkout line between two grocery stores in a large city. She went to Grocery Store J on a Monday morning and recorded the time, in minutes, it took 30 customers to go through a checkout line. Then she went to Grocery Store K on Monday afternoon and recorded the time it took 30 customers to go through a checkout line. Hannah calculated the mean number of minutes for the customers in each line. She intends to conduct a two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for a difference in means between the two stores.",
