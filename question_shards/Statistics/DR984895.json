    "description": "Two different drugs, X and Y, are currently in use to treat a certain condition. About 7 percent of the people using either drug experience side effects. A random sample of 75 people using drug X and a random sample of 150 people using drug Y are selected. The proportion of people in each sample who experience side effects is recorded.",
