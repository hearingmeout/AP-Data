    "question": "Monthly rent was determined for each apartment in a random sample of 100 apartments. The sample mean was $820 and the sample standard deviation was $25. An approximate 95 percent confidence interval for the true mean monthly rent for the population of apartments from which this sample was selected is ($815, $825). Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the 95 percent confidence level?",
