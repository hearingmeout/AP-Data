    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.Because of concerns about employee stress, a large company is conducting a study to compare two programs (tai chi or yoga) that may help employees reduce their stress levels. Tai chi is a 1,200-year-old practice, originating in China, that consists of slow, fluid movements. Yoga is a practice, originating in India, that consists of breathing exercises and movements designed to stretch and relax muscles. The company has assembled a group of volunteer employees to participate in the study during the first half of their lunch hour each day for a 10-week period. Each volunteer will be assigned at random to one of the two programs. Volunteers will have their stress levels measured just before beginning the program and 10 weeks later at the completion of it.A group of volunteers who work together ask to be assigned to the same program so that they can participate in that program together. Give an example of a problem that might arise if this is permitted. Explain to this volunteer group why random assignment to the two programs will address this problem.Someone proposes that a control group be included in the design as well. The stress level would be measured for each volunteer assigned to the control group at the start of the study and again 10 weeks later. What additional information, if any, would this provide about the effectiveness of the two programs?Is it reasonable to generalize the findings of this study to all employees of this company? Explain.",
