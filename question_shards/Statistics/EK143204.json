    "question": "The distribution of heights of 6-year-old girls is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 46.0 inches and a standard deviation of 2.7 inches. Aliyaah is 6 years old, and her height is 0.96 standard deviation above the mean. Her friend Jayne is also 6 years old and is at the 93rd percentile of the height distribution. At what percentile is Aliyaah’s height, and how does her height compare to Jayne’s height?",
