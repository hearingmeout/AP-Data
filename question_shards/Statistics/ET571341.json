  "content": {
    "description": "A randomized experiment was performed to determine whether two fertilizers, A and B, give different yields of tomatoes. A total of 33 tomato plants were grown; 16 using fertilizer A, and 17 using fertilizer B. The distributions of the data did not show marked skewness and there were no outliers in either data set. The results of the experiment are shown below.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment?",
