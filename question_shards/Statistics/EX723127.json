    "question": "An experiment will be conducted to test the effectiveness of a weight-loss supplement. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to take either the supplement or a placebo for 90 days, with 12 volunteers in each group. The subjects will not know which treatment they receive. At the end of the experiment, researchers plan to calculate the mean weight loss for each of the two groups and to construct a two-sample t-confidence interval for the difference of the two treatment means. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the confidence interval to be valid?",
