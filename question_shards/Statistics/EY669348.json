    "description": "A recent increase in sales of microchips has forced a computer company to buy a new processing machine to help keep up with demand. The builders of the new machine claim that it produces fewer defective microchips than the older machine. From a random sample of 90 microchips produced on the old machine, 5 were found to be defective. From a random sample of 83 microchips produced on the new machine, 3 were found to be defective. The quality control manager wants to construct a confidence interval to estimate the difference between the proportion of defective microchips from the older machine and the proportion of defective microchips from the new machine.",
