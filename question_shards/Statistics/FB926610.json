Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A medical researcher surveyed a large group of men and women about whether they take medicine as prescribed. The responses were categorized as never, sometimes, or always. The relative frequency of each category is shown in the table. Never Sometimes Always Total Men 0.0564 0.2016 0.2120 0.4700 Women 0.0636 0.1384 0.3280 0.5300 Total 0.1200 0.3400 0.5400 1.0000 (a) One person from those surveyed will be selected at random. (i) What is the probability that the person selected will be someone whose response is never and who is a woman? (ii) What is the probability that the person selected will be someone whose response is never or who is a woman? (iii) What is the probability that the person selected will be someone whose response is never given that the person is a woman?",
