The study found that 39 percent of men in the sample were fans and 22 percent of women in the sample were fans. A 99 percent confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of fans of a professional football team between men and women was reported as <math alttext=\"0.133 comma 0.207\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>0.133</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0.207</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.
