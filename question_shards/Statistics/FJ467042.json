    "description": "A new laser-guided surgical procedure for removing an inflamed appendix is believed to have a shorter recovery time for patients than an alternative surgical procedure that is not guided by laser has. In an experiment to evaluate recovery time, patients needing the surgery will be randomly assigned to one of two surgical procedures. A surgeon will perform the surgery for one group using lasers and for the other group without the use of lasers. Both types of surgeries are performed with similarly sized incisions and patients are unaware of which procedure is performed.",
