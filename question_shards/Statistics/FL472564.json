    "question": "A hypothesis test was conducted to investigate whether the population proportion of students at a certain college who went to the movie theater last weekend is greater than 0.2. A random sample of 100 students at this college resulted in a test statistic of 2.25. Assuming all conditions for inference were met, which of the following is closest to the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test?",
