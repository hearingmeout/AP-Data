    "description": "Attendance records at a large high school show that <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> percent of students are late to school on a typical day. The students in an AP Statistics class believe the rate is higher than <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> percent. The students took a simple random sample of <math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math> students from the school and asked, “Were you late to school today?” In their sample, <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> out of the <math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math> students, or <math alttext=\"8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math> percent of the sample, said they were late to school that day. The AP Statistics students conducted a simulation with <math alttext=\"100\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>100</mn></math> samples of <math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>75</mn></math> students from a population where <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> percent of students are late. The results of the simulation are shown in the dotplot.",
    "question": "Based on the simulation and the results of the AP Statistics class’s sample, is there convincing statistical evidence that more than <math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math> percent of all students at the school are late to school on a typical day?",
