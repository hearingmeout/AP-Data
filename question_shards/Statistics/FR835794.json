    "question": "At a large high school 40 percent of the students walk to school, 32 percent of the students have been late to school at least once, and 37.5 percent of the students who walk to school have been late to school at least once. One student from the school will be selected at random. What is the probability that the student selected will be one who both walks to school and has been late to school at least once?",
