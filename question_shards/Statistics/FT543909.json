    "question": "A manufacturer makes lightbulbs and claims that their reliability is 98 percent. Reliability is defined to be the proportion of nondefective items that are produced over the long term. If the company's claim is correct, what is the expected number of nondefective lightbulbs in a random sample of 1,000 bulbs?",
