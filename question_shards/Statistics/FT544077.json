    "description": "The following question(s) refer to the following information.\n\nEvery Thursday, Matt and Dave's Video Venture has \"roll-the-dice\" day. A customer may choose to roll two fair dice and rent a second movie for an amount (in cents) equal to the numbers uppermost on the dice, with the larger number first. For example, if the customer rolls a two and a four, a second movie may be rented for $0.42. If a two and two are rolled, a second movie may be rented for $0.22. Let X represent the amount paid for a second movie on roll-the-dice day. The expected value of X is $0.47 and the standard deviation of X is $0.15.",
    "question": "If the customer rolls the dice and rents a second movie every Thursday for 20 consecutive weeks, what is the total amount that the customer would expect to pay for these second movies?",
