    "question": "At a college the scores on the chemistry final exam are approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 12. The scores on the calculus final are also approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 8. A student scored 81 on the chemistry final and 84 on the calculus final. Relative to the students in each respective class, in which subject did this student do better?",
