The test gives a negative result 0.3 percent of the time for people who have the disease. Large-scale studies have shown that the disease occurs in about 2 percent of the population.What is the probability that a person selected at random would test positive for this disease? Show your work.What is the probability that a person selected at random who tests positive for the disease does not have the disease? Show your work.",
