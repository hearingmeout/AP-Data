    "question": "A random sample of 415 potential voters was interviewed 3 weeks before the start of a state-wide campaign for governor; 223 of the 415 said they favored the new candidate over the incumbent. However, the new candidate made several unfortunate remarks one week before the election. Subsequently, a new random sample of 630 potential voters showed that 317 voters favored the new candidate.\nDo these data support the conclusion that there was a decrease in voter support for the new candidate after the unfortunate remarks were made? Give appropriate statistical evidence to support your answer.",
