    "question": "A department supervisor is considering purchasing one of two comparable photocopy machines, A or B. Machine A costs $10,000 and machine B costs $10,500. This department replaces photocopy machines every three years. The repair contract for machine A costs $50 per month and covers an unlimited number of repairs. The repair contract for machine B costs $200 per repair. Based on past performance, the distribution of the number of repairs needed over any one-year period for machine B is shown below.\n\nYou are asked to give a recommendation based on overall cost as to which machine, A or B, along with its repair contract, should be purchased. What would your recommendation be? Give a statistical justification to support your recommendation.",
