    "question": "A study was conducted using data collected on the birth weights of a random sample of 10 pairs of identical twins to determine whether the twin born first tends to weigh more than the twin born second. Let μF represent the average birth weight of all twins born first, μs represent the average birth weight of all twins born second, and μD represent the average difference in birth weight (weight of first minus weight of second) for all pairs of twins. Which of the following would be the null and alternative hypotheses for this study?",
