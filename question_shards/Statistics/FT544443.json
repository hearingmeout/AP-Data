    "question": "Sophomore, junior, and senior students at a high school will be surveyed regarding a potential increase in the extracurricular student activities fee. There are three possible responses to the survey question - agree with the increase, do not agree with the increase, or no opinion. A chi-square test will be conducted to determine whether the response to this question is independent of the class in which the student is a member. How many degrees of freedom should the chi-square test have?",
