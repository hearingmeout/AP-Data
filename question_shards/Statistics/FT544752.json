    "description": "The following question(s)  refer to the following scenario and set of data.\n\nIn the 1830s, land surveyors began to survey the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. Part of their task was to note the sizes of trees they encountered in their surveying. The table of data below is for bur oak trees measured during the survey.",
    "question": "An outlier may be defined as a data point that is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range below the lower quartile or is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile. According to this definition, what is the diameter, in inches, of the smallest tree that is an outlier?",
