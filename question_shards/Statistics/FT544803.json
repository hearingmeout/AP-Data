    "question": "Traffic data revealed that 35 percent of automobiles traveling along a portion of an interstate highway were exceeding the legal speed limit. Using highway cameras and license plate registrations, it was also determined that 52 percent of sports cars were also speeding along the same portion of the highway. What is the probability that a randomly selected car along the same portion of the highway was a speeding sports car?",
