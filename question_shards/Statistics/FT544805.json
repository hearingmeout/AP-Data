    "question": "The number of points, X, scored in a game has the probability distribution below\n\nThe number of points obtained in one game is independent of the number of points obtained in a second game. When the game is played twice, the sum of the number of points for both times could be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If Y represents the sampling distribution of the sum of the scores when the game is played twice, for which value of Y will the probability be greatest?",
