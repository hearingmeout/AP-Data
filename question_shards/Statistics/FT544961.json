    "question": "A dog food company wishes to test a new high-protein formula for puppy food to determine whether it promotes faster weight gain than the existing formula for that puppy food. Puppies participating in an experiment will be weighed at weaning (when they begin to eat puppy food) and will be weighed at one-month intervals for one year. In designing this experiment, the investigators wish to reduce the variability due to natural differences in puppy growth rates. Which of the following strategies is most appropriate for accomplishing this?",
