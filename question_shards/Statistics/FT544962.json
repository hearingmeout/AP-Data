    "question": "A statistics student wants to compare the mean times needed to access flight information for two major airlines. Twenty randomly selected students accessed one airline's Web site, and the time required to locate the flight information using the Web site had a mean of 2.5 minutes and a standard deviation of 0.8 minute. Twenty different randomly selected students accessed the other airline's Web site, and the time required to locate the flight information using the Web site had a mean of 2.1 minutes and a standard deviation of 1.1 minutes. Assuming that the conditions for inference are met, which of the following statements about the p-value obtained from the data and the conclusion of the significance test is true?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The p-value is less than 0.01; therefore, there is a significant difference in mean search times on the two Web sites.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The p-value is greater than 0.01 but less than 0.05; therefore, there is a significant difference in mean search times on the two Web sites.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The p-value is greater than 0.05 but less than 0.10; therefore, there is a significant difference in mean search times on the two Web sites.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The p-value is greater than 0.10; therefore, there is no significant difference in mean search times on the two Web sites.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Since this is a matched-pairs situation, additional information is needed to perform a test of significance.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The p-value is greater than 0.10; therefore, there is no significant difference in mean search times on the two Web sites."
