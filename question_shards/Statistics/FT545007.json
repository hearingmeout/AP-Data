    "question": "Caffeine, a chemical found in many popular beverages, is known for reducing fatigue. A student wanted to investigate the caffeine content in popular beverages, such as soft drinks, energy drinks, tea, and coffee. The following data collected by the student show the amounts of caffeine (in milligrams per 12-ounce serving) for twelve popular beverages\n\n72\n 55\n 34\n 45\n 38\n 70\n 7.5\n 165\n 80\n 105\n 40\n 35\n\nConstruct an appropriate graphical display of the amounts of caffeine found in the twelve beverages.\n\nUse the graph in part (a) to write a few sentences describing the distribution of caffeine content for the twelve beverages.\n\nA 12-ounce cup of one popular gourmet coffee contains over 300 milligrams of caffeine. If this value was added to the data set of twelve numbers above, how would the mean and median of the data set above compare with the mean and median of the new data set with the thirteen numbers? Explain how this comparison could be made without performing any",
