    "question": "The department of parks and recreation of a certain city conducts summer programs for residents of its six districts. The summer programs include operating and maintaining community swimming pools in each of the districts as well as offering sports and recreational programs for school-age children, young adults, and older adults.\n\nThe table below shows the proportion of households by district out of all households that participated in the summer programs, based on annual data that were collected from simple random samples each summer over a 10-year period, ending in the year 2000. The proportions are being used by the city for planning purposes and for more efficiently targeting the introduction of future programs.\n\nCity leaders want to test if the proportions that are being used by the city are still valid. Data collected by a statistician from a simple random sample this past summer indicated that the following number of households participated in each district.\n\nThe statistician claims that the data for this past summer provide evidence that the proportions that are being used by the city are no longer valid. Give statistical evidence to justify the claim.\n\nWhich one of the six districts had the greatest change in participation since the year 2000? Use the information from part (a) to explain your choice.",
