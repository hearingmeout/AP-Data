    "question": "A company sells concrete in batches of 5 cubic yards. The probability distribution of X, the number of cubic yards sold in a single order for concrete from this company, is shown in the table below.\n\nThe expected value of the probability distribution of X is 19.25 and the standard deviation is 5.76. There is a fixed cost to deliver the concrete. The profit Y, in dollars, for a particular order can be described by Y = 75X - 100. What is the standard deviation of Y?",
