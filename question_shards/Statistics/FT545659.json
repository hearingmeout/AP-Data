    "question": "The computer output below shows the result of a linear regression analysis for predicting the concentration of zinc, in parts per million (ppm), from the concentration of lead, in ppm, found in fish from a certain river.\n\nWhich of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the value 19.0 in the output?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "On average there is a predicted increase of 19.0 ppm in concentration of lead for every increase of 1 ppm in concentration of zinc found in the fish.",
