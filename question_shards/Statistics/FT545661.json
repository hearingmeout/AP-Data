    "question": "A physician believes that the exercise habits of East Coast adults are different from the exercise habits of West Coast adults. To study this, she gathers information on the number of hours of exercise per week from a random sample of East Coast adults and a random sample of West Coast adults. Which of the following might be an appropriate null hypothesis for this study?",
