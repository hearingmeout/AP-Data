    "question": "For a roll of a fair die, each of the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 is equally likely. A red die and a green die are rolled simultaneously, and the difference of the outcomes (red – green) is computed. This is repeated for a total of 500 rolls of the pair of dice. Which of the following graphs best represents the most reasonable distribution of the differences?",
