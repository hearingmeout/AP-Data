  "content": {
    "description": "In a recent survey, high school students and their parents were asked to rate 60 recently released movies. The ratings were on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 was “horrible” and 9 was “excellent”. For each movie, the average rating by the students and the average rating by their parents was calculated and the scatterplot below was constructed.The horizontal axis represents the student rating, and the vertical axis represents the parent rating.Thus, an individual data point would represent the rating of a single movie.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements is justified by the scatterplot?",
