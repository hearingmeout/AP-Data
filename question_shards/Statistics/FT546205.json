    "question": "Two college roommates have each committed to donating to charity each week for the next year. The roommates’ weekly incomes are independent of each other. Suppose the amount donated in a week by one roommate is approximately normal with mean $30 and standard deviation $10, and the amount donated in a week by the other roommate is approximately normal with mean $60 and standard deviation $20. Which of the following is closest to the expected number of weeks in a 52-week year that their combined donation will exceed $120 ?",
