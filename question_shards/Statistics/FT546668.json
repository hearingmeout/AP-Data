    "question": "A researcher constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean number of alfalfa weevils on an alfalfa plant within a field. Based on 80 randomly selected alfalfa plants, the researcher found an average of 2.5 alfalfa weevils per plant and computed the 95 percent confidence interval to be 1.50 to 3.50. Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the 95 percent confidence level?",
