    "description": "An amateur men’s swimming association is trying to decide whether times in the 100-meter breaststroke will be reduced if the men shave their heads. From the population of swimmers, six were selected at random and agreed to swim two races—one before shaving their heads and one after shaving their heads. The results for each race, with times in seconds, are given in the table below.",
    "question": "Let µ1 represent the population mean of swimming times before shaving and µ2 represent the population mean of swimming times after shaving. Let µd represent the population mean of the differences, X1 - X2. These differences follow a normal distribution. Which of the following would be the most appropriate test and alternative hypothesis to use in testing this theory?",
