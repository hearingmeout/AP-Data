    "question": "A newspaper poll found that 52 percent of the respondents in a large random sample of likely voters in a district intend to vote for candidate Smith rather than the opponent. A 95 percent confidence interval for the population proportion was computed to be 0.52 ± 0.04. Based on the confidence interval, which of the following should the newspaper report to its readers?",
