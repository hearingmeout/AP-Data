    "question": "A researcher is conducting a study of charitable donations by surveying a simple random sample of households in a certain city. The researcher wants to determine whether there is convincing statistical evidence that more than 50 percent of households in the city gave a charitable donation in the past year. Let p represent the proportion of all households in the city that gave a charitable donation in the past year. Which of the following are appropriate hypotheses for the researcher?",
