    "question": "A news article reported that college students who have part-time jobs work an average of 15 hours per week. The staff of a college newspaper thought that the average might be different from 15 hours per week for their college. Data were collected on the number of hours worked per week for a random sample of students at the college who have part-time jobs. The data were used to test the hypotheses\n\nH0: μ = 15\n\nHa: μ ≠ 15,\n\nwhere µ is the mean number of hours worked per week for all students at the college with part-time jobs. The results of the test are shown in the table below.\n\nAssuming all conditions for inference were met, which of the following represents a 95 percent confidence interval for µ?",
