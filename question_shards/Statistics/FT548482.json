    "question": "A representative of a car manufacturer in the United States made the following claim in a news report.\n\nTen years ago, only 53 percent of Americans owned American-made cars, but that figure is significantly higher today.\n\nA research group conducted a study to investigate whether the claim was true. The group found that 56 percent of a randomly selected sample of car owners in the United States owned American-made cars. A test of the appropriate hypotheses resulted in a p-value of 0.283. Assuming the conditions for inference were met, is there sufficient evidence to conclude, at the significance level of a = 0.05, that the proportion of all car owners in the United States who own American-made cars has increased from what it was ten years ago?",
