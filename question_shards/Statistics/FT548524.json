    "question": "A florist wanted to investigate whether a new powder added to the water of cut flowers helps to keep the flowers fresh longer than just water alone. For a shipment of roses that was delivered to the store, the florist flipped a coin before placing each rose in its own individual container with water. If the coin landed heads up, the rose was placed in water with the new powder; otherwise, the rose was placed in water alone. Which of the following is the best description of the method used by the florist?",
