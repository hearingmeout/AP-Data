    "question": "The scatterplot below displays the price in dollars and quality rating for 14 different sewing machines.\n\n(a) Describe the nature of the association between price and quality rating for the sewing machines.\n\n(b) One of the 14 sewing machines substantially affects the appropriateness of using a linear regression model to predict quality rating based on price. Report the approximate price and quality rating of that machine and explain your choice.\n\n(c) Chris is interested in buying one of the 14 sewing machines. He will consider buying only those machines for which there is no other machine that has both higher quality and lower price. On the scatterplot reproduced below, circle all data points corresponding to machines that Chris will consider buying.",
