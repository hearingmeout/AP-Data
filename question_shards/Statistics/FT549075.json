    "question": "Independent random samples of 500 households were taken from a large metropolitan area in the United States for the years 1950 and 2000. Histograms of household size (number of people in a household) for the years are shown below.(a) Compare the distributions of household size in the metropolitan area for the years 1950 and 2000.(b) A researcher wants to use these data to construct a confidence interval to estimate the change in mean household size in the metropolitan area from the year 1950 to the year 2000. State the conditions for using a two-sample t-procedure, and explain whether the conditions for inference are met.",
