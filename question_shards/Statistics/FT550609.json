    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA hospital administrator noticed that the first nonemergency surgery scheduled each day often started late. If the first scheduled surgery got delayed, then all of the other surgeries scheduled for that day also got delayed. For three weeks (a total of 15 days) the administrator recorded how many minutes past the scheduled time the first surgery began each weekday. The data are shown in the table below.\n\nThe administrator sent a memo to the hospital’s entire surgical staff to ask that everyone work to reduce the delay in the starting time for the first nonemergency surgery each day. The administrator recorded how many minutes past the scheduled starting time the first scheduled surgery began each weekday for the three weeks after the memo was sent out. The data are shown in the table below. A negative number in the table indicates that the surgery started earlier than the scheduled time.\n\nThe dotplots below display the distributions of minutes past the scheduled starting time before the memo went out and after the memo went out.\n\nBased only on the dotplots, does it appear that the distribution of minutes past the scheduled starting time changed after the memo was sent? Explain.\n\nThe hospital administrator wants to perform a two-sample t-test to determine whether the average number of minutes past the scheduled starting time changed after the memo was sent. State the conditions for that test. For each condition, comment on whether it appears to be met.",
