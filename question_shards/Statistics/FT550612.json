    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA taxicab company in a large city charges passengers a flat fee to enter a cab plus an additional fee per mile. There is also a charge for time spent stopped in traffic. The company wants to develop a new method for determining fares based on mileage and a flat fee only, not on time spent stopped in traffic. A random sample of 10 recent cab fares was selected, and the distance, in miles, and the fare, in dollars, were recorded. A regression model was fit to the data, and the output, scatterplot, and residual plot are given below.\n\nState the equation of the least squares regression line for these data. Define any variables used in the equation.\n\nA 95 percent confidence interval for the intercept of the least squares regression line is (3.61, 4.98). Construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of the least squares regression line. Assume the conditions for inference are met.\n\nThe company wants to know if charging a flat fee of $3.00 and a per-mile charge of $1.50 will maintain its current revenue. Based on the information in part (b), is a flat fee of $3.00 a reasonable value? Explain.",
