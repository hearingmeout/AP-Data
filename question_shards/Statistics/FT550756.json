Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nThe graph below shows the monthly average temperatures, in degrees Fahrenheit, for two cities–Madison,Wisconsin, and Juneau, Alaska–in the United States.\n\nBased on the graph, compare the two cities with respect to the monthly average temperatures over the year. Address both similarities and differences in the overall patterns.\n\nSimilarities:\n\nDifferences:\n\nFor which of the two cities is the standard deviation of the 12 monthly average temperatures greater? Justify your answer without performing any calculations.",
