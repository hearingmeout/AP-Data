    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nPatients experiencing symptoms of a heart attack are routinely transported to a hospital in an ambulance. In a study of a new treatment thought to reduce damage to the heart, patients experiencing symptoms of a heart attack were randomly assigned to one of two groups. During transportation to the hospital, patients in one group received standard care, and patients in the other group received the new treatment consisting of standard care and the application of a blood pressure cuff.\n\nThe response variable measured for each patient was a number between 0 and 1, referred to as the myocardial salvage index (MSI). A higher MSI value indicates a more positive outcome for the patient. Summary statistics for the MSI responses of the two groups are shown in the table below.\n\nDo the data provide convincing statistical evidence that the new treatment results in a higher mean MSI value than does the standard care among people similar to the patients in the study?",
