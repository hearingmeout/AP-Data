    "question": "A piñata is a container filled with toys and candy and is broken open by hitting it with a stick. The drawing above shows Sophia trying to break a piñata. The probability that she will break the piñata on the first hit is 0.7. She will continue to hit the piñata until it breaks. If she does not break the piñata on a particular hit, the piñata is weakened and the probability that she will break it on the next hit is 0.1 greater than the probability on the previous hit. For example, if the piñata does not break on the first hit, the probability that it will break on the second hit is 0.8.\n\nCalculate the probability that Sophia does not break the piñata on the first hit and does break the piñata on the second hit.\n\nLet the random variable X represent the number of hits required for Sophia to break the piñata.\n\nComplete the probability distribution of X in the table below.\n\nCalculate and interpret the expected value of X.\n\nCalculation:\n\nInterpretation:",
