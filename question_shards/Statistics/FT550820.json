Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.The weights of red delicious apples are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 9 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.75 ounce. An online gift store sells gift boxes containing 5 red delicious apples. At the time of packaging, 5 red delicious apples are randomly selected and packaged in a box.Describe the distribution of the total weight of the 5 randomly selected apples.What is the probability that the total weight of the 5 randomly selected apples will be less than 42 ounces?The combined weight of the packing material and box in which the apples will be shipped is always 10 ounces. Let W represent the weight of a complete packaged gift box, which consists of the packing material, box, and 5 randomly selected apples. What are the mean and the standard deviation of W ?",
