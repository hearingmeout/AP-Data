    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nRecently, a company acquired the rights to use a forest—like the one shown in the photograph below—to harvest trees to produce lumber.\n\nThe company wants to conduct a study to estimate the mean trunk diameter of the trees from the forest by taking a random sample of approximately 5 percent of the trees from the forest. For the study, the company divides the forest into 200 equally sized plots of approximately one acre each, as shown in the figure below.\n\nBecause of previous logging practices and growth patterns, plots with older trees, such as Plot 6, tend to have fewer trees but with larger trunk diameters, and plots with younger trees, such as Plot 121, tend to have more trees but with smaller trunk diameters. This is illustrated in the two figures of Plots 6 and 121 by the varying number and sizes of the symbol ⊕ .\n\nDescribe a procedure for using cluster sampling to obtain a random sample of approximately 5 percent of the trees from the forest, using the plots as clusters.\n\nDescribe a procedure for using stratified sampling to obtain a random sample of approximately 5 percent of the trees from the forest, using the plots as strata.\n\nFor the study, give one advantage of using cluster sampling as described in part (a) over stratified sampling as described in part (b).\n\nFor the study, give one advantage of using stratified sampling as described in part (b) over cluster sampling as described in part (a).",
