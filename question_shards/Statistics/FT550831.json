    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nNatural gas is used in some households to heat the home, to heat the water, and to cook. A utility company sent the following bar chart to a household to show the amount of natural gas, measured in therms (a unit of heat energy), that the household used last year. The chart shows the number of therms and the average monthly temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, for each month of the year.\n\nDescribe how the number of therms used each month changed over the year.\n\nConstruct an appropriate graph that shows the relationship between the number of therms used and the average monthly temperature.\n\nDescribe what your graph in part (b) reveals about the relationship between the number of therms used and the average monthly temperature that is not revealed on the bar chart sent by the utility company.",
