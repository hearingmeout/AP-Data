    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nPhone callers to a bank’s customer service center must wait until a service representative is available to answer the phone call. The bank manager is interested in estimating the mean customer wait time. Thirteen calls were selected at random. A histogram of the 13 wait times, in minutes, is shown below.\n\nBased on the histogram, explain why it might not be appropriate to use a one-sample t-interval to estimate the mean wait time for all customers.\n\nA logarithmic transformation is often used to transform data such as wait times. Let x represent a customer’s wait time. The log transformation of the customer’s wait time is given by log10x . The table below shows the original 13 wait times, the respective log-transformed wait times, and the corresponding means, medians, and standard deviations.\n\nA histogram of the 13 log-transformed data values is shown below.\n\nThe summary statistics for x and log10x are repeated below.\n\nBased on the histogram, the conditions for inference have been met for the log-transformed data. Construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the population mean µ of the log of the wait times.\n\nThe mean of the log-transformed data is 0.0632 log10 minutes, which can be converted back to 1.157 minutes by calculating 100.632 . Convert the endpoints of your interval in part (b) back to minutes and write the resulting interval.\n\nGraph 1 below shows a population distribution of the log of wait times, in log10 minutes, which is normal with mean µ. Graph 2 shows the result of converting the population distribution in Graph 1 back to the population distribution of wait times, in minutes. The lower 50 percent of the distribution is shaded in each graph.\n\nd. Consider the parameter 10µ in Graph 2.\n\nHow does the parameter 10µ compare with the median of the population distribution of wait times?\n\nHow does parameter 10µ compare with the mean of the population distribution of wait times?\n\ne. Write an interpretation of the interval you constructed in part c.",
