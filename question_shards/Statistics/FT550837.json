    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. An environmental group conducted a study to determine whether crows in a certain region were ingesting food containing unhealthy levels of lead. A biologist classified lead levels greater than 6.0 parts per million (ppm) as unhealthy. The lead levels of a random sample of 23 crows in the region were measured and recorded. The data are shown in the stemplot below. What proportion of crows in the sample had lead levels that are classified by the biologist as unhealthy? The mean lead level of the 23 crows in the sample was 4.90 ppm and the standard deviation was 1.12 ppm. Construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean lead level of crows in the region.",
