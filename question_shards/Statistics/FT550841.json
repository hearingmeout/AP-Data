    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nPsychologists interested in the relationship between meditation and health conducted a study with a random sample of 28 men who live in a large retirement community. Of the men in the sample, 11 reported that they participate in daily meditation and 17 reported that they do not participate in daily meditation.\n\nThe researchers wanted to perform a hypothesis test of\n\nH0 : Pm – Pc = 0\n\nHa : Pm – Pc < 0 ,\n\nwhere Pm is the proportion of men with high blood pressure among all the men in the retirement community who participate in daily meditation and Pc is the proportion of men with high blood pressure among all the men in the retirement community who do not participate in daily meditation.\n\na. If the study were to provide significant evidence against H0 in favor of Ha , would it be reasonable for the psychologists to conclude that daily meditation causes a reduction in blood pressure for men in the retirement community? Explain why or why not.\n\nThe psychologists found that of the 11 men in the study who participate in daily meditation, 0 had high blood pressure. Of the 17 men who do not participate in daily meditation, 8 had high blood pressure.\n\nb. Let ˆPm represent the proportion of men with high blood pressure among those in a random sample of 11 who meditate daily, and let ˆPc represent the proportion of men with high blood pressure among those in a random sample of 17 who do not meditate daily. Why is it not reasonable to use a normal approximation for the sampling distribution of ˆPm – ˆPc?\n\nAlthough a normal approximation cannot be used, it is possible to simulate the distribution of ˆPm – ˆPc . Under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, 10,000 values of ˆPm – ˆPc were simulated. The histogram below shows the results of the simulation.\n\nc. Based on the results of the simulation, what can be concluded about the relationship between blood pressure and meditation among men in the retirement community?",
