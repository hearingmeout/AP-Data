    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nTropical storms in the Pacific Ocean with sustained winds that exceed 74 miles per hour are called typhoons. Graph A below displays the number of recorded typhoons in two regions of the Pacific Ocean—the Eastern Pacific and the Western Pacific—for the years from 1997 to 2010.\n\nCompare the distributions of yearly frequencies of typhoons for the two regions of the Pacific Ocean for the years from 1997 to 2010.\n\nFor each region, describe how the yearly frequencies changed over the time period from 1997 to 2010.\n\nA moving average for data collected at regular time increments is the average of data values for two or more consecutive increments. The 4-year moving averages for the typhoon data are provided in the table below. For example, the Eastern Pacific 4-year moving average for 2000 is the average of 22, 16, 15, and 21, which is equal to 18.50.\n\nc. Show how to calculate the 4-year moving average for the year 2010 in the Western Pacific. Write your value in the appropriate place in the table.\n\nd. Graph B below shows both yearly frequencies (connected by dashed lines) and the respective 4-year moving averages (connected by solid lines). Use your answer in part (c) to complete the graph.\n\ne. Consider graph B.\n\nWhat information is more apparent from the plots of the 4-year moving averages than from the plots of the yearly frequencies of typhoons?\n\nWhat information is less apparent from the plots of the 4-year moving averages than from the plots of the yearly frequencies of typhoons?",
