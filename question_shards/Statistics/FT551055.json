    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Since Hill Valley High School eliminated the use of bells between classes, teachers have noticed that more students seem to be arriving to class a few minutes late. One teacher decided to collect data to determine whether the students’ and teachers’ watches are displaying the correct time. At exactly 12:00 noon, the teacher asked 9 randomly selected students and 9 randomly selected teachers to record the times on their watches to the nearest half minute. The ordered data showing minutes after 12:00 as positive values and minutes before 12:00 as negative values are shown in the table below. Construct parallel boxplots using these data. Based on the boxplots in part (a), which of the two groups, students or teachers, tends to have watch times that are closer to the true time? Explain your choice. The teacher wants to know whether individual student’s watches tend to be set correctly. She proposes to test H0 : µ = 0 versus Ha : µ ≠ 0, where µ represents the mean amount by which all student watches differ from the correct time. Is this an appropriate pair of hypotheses to test to answer the teacher’s question? Explain why or why not. Do not carry out the test.",
