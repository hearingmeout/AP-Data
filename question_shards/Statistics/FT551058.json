    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nMen’s shirt sizes are determined by their neck sizes. Suppose that men’s neck sizes are approximately normally distributed with mean 15.7 inches and standard deviation 0.7 inch. A retailer sells men’s shirts in sizes S, M, L, XL, where the shirt sizes are defined in the table below.\n\nBecause the retailer only stocks the sizes listed above, what proportion of customers will find that the retailer does not carry any shirts in their sizes? Show your work.\n\nUsing a sketch of a normal curve, illustrate the proportion of men whose shirt size is M. Calculate this proportion.\n\nOf 12 randomly selected customers, what is the probability that exactly 4 will request size M? Show your work.",
