    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nA consumer advocate conducted a test of two popular gasoline additives, A and B. There are claims that the use of either of these additives will increase gasoline mileage in cars. A random sample of 30 cars was selected. Each car was filled with gasoline and the cars were run under the same driving conditions until the gas tanks were empty. The distance traveled was recorded for each car.\n\nAdditive A was randomly assigned to 15 of the cars and additive B was randomly assigned to the other 15 cars. The gas tank of each car was filled with gasoline and the assigned additive. The cars were again run under the same driving conditions until the tanks were empty. The distance traveled was recorded and the difference in the distance with the additive minus the distance without the additive for each car was calculated.\n\nThe following table summarizes the calculated differences. Note that negative values indicate less distance was traveled with the additive than without the additive.\n\nOn the grid below, display parallel boxplots (showing outliers, if any) of the differences of the two additives.\n\nTwo ways that the effectiveness of a gasoline additive can be evaluated are by looking at either\n\nthe proportion of cars that have increased gas mileage when the additive is used in those cars\n\nor\n\nthe mean increase in gas mileage when the additive is used in those cars.\n\nWhich additive, A or B, would you recommend if the goal is to increase gas mileage in the highest proportion of cars? Explain your choice.\n\nWhich additive, A or B, would you recommend if the goal is to have the highest mean increase in gas mileage? Explain your choice.",
