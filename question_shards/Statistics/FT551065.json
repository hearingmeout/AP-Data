    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nResearchers who are studying a new shampoo formula plan to compare the condition of hair for people who use the new formula with the condition of hair for people who use the current formula. Twelve volunteers are available to participate in this study. Information on these volunteers (numbered 1 through 12) is shown in the table below.\n\nThese researchers want to conduct an experiment involving the two formulas (new and current) of shampoo. They believe that the condition of hair changes with age but not gender. Because researchers want the size of the blocks in an experiment to be equal to the number of treatments, they will use blocks of size 2 in their experiment. Identify the volunteers (by number) that would be included in each of the six blocks and give the criteria you used to form the blocks.\n\nOther researchers believe that hair condition differs with both age and gender. These researchers will also use blocks of size 2 in their experiment. Identify the volunteers (by number) that would be included in each of the six blocks and give the criteria you used to form the blocks.\n\nThe researchers in part (b) decide to select three of the six blocks to receive the new formula and to give the other three blocks the current formula. Is this an appropriate way to assign treatments? If so, describe a method for selecting the three blocks to receive the new formula. If not, describe an appropriate method for assigning treatments.",
