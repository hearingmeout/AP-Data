    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nTwo antibiotics are available as treatment for a common ear infection in children.\n\nAntibiotic A is known to effectively cure the infection 60 percent of the time. Treatment with antibiotic A costs $50.\n\nAntibiotic B is known to effectively cure the infection 90 percent of the time. Treatment with antibiotic B costs $80.\n\nThe antibiotics work independently of one another. Both antibiotics can be safely administered to children. A health insurance company intends to recommend one of the following two plans of treatment for children with this ear infection.\n\nPlan I: Treat with antibiotic A first. If it is not effective, then treat with antibiotic B.\n\nPlan II: Treat with antibiotic B first. If it is not effective, then treat with antibiotic A.\n\nIf a doctor treats a child with an ear infection using plan I, what is the probability that the child will be cured?\n\nIf a doctor treats a child with an ear infection using plan II, what is the probability that the child will be cured?\n\nCompute the expected cost per child when plan I is used for treatment.\n\nCompute the expected cost per child when plan II is used for treatment.\n\nBased on the results in parts (a) and (b), which plan would you recommend?\n\nExplain your recommendation.",
