    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nA rural county hospital offers several health services. The hospital administrators conducted a poll to determine whether the residents’ satisfaction with the available services depends on their gender. A random sample of 1,000 adult county residents was selected. The gender of each respondent was recorded and each was asked whether he or she was satisfied with the services offered by the hospital. The resulting data are shown in the table below.\n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05, conduct an appropriate test to determine if, for adult residents of this county, there is an association between gender and whether or not they were satisfied with services offered by the hospital.\n\nIs 800/1,000 a reasonable estimate for the proportion of all adult county residents who are satisfied with the services offered by this hospital? Explain why or why not.",
