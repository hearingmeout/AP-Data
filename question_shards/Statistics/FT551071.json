    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Let the random variable X represent the number of telephone lines in use by the technical support center of a software manufacturer at noon each day. The probability distribution of X is shown in the table below. (a) Calculate the expected value (the mean) of X. (b) Using past records, the staff at the technical support center randomly selected 20 days and found that an average of 1.25 telephone lines were in use at noon on those days. The staff proposes to select another random sample of 1,000 days and compute the average number of telephone lines that were in use at noon on those days. How do you expect the average from this new sample to compare to that of the first sample? Justify your response. (c) The median of a random variable is defined as any value x such that P(X ≤ x) ≥ 0.5 and P(X ≥ x) ≥ 0.5. For the probability distribution shown in the table above, determine the median of X. (d) In a sentence or two, comment on the relationship between the mean and the median relative to the shape of this distribution.",
