    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. The Great Plains Railroad is interested in studying how fuel consumption is related to the number of railcars for its trains on a certain route between Oklahoma City and Omaha. A random sample of 10 trains on this route has yielded the data in the table below. A scatterplot, a residual plot, and the output from the regression analysis for these data are shown below. Is a linear model appropriate for modeling these data? Clearly explain your reasoning. Suppose the fuel consumption cost is $25 per unit. Give a point estimate (single value) for the change in the average cost of fuel per mile for each additional railcar attached to a train. Show your work. Interpret the value of r2 in the context of this problem. Would it be reasonable to use the fitted regression equation to predict the fuel consumption for a train on this route if the train had 65 railcars? Explain.",
