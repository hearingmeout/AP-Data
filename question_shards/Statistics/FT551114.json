    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nA biologist is interested in studying the effect of growth-enhancing nutrients and different salinity (salt) levels in water on the growth of shrimps. The biologist has ordered a large shipment of young tiger shrimps from a supply house for use in the study. The experiment is to be conducted in a laboratory where 10 tiger shrimps are placed randomly into each of 12 similar tanks in a controlled environment. The biologist is planning to use 3 different growth-enhancing nutrients (A, B, and C) and two different salinity levels (low and high).\n\nList the treatments that the biologist plans to use in this experiment.\n\nUsing the treatments listed in part (a), describe a completely randomized design that will allow the biologist to compare the shrimps’ growth after 3 weeks.\n\nGive one statistical advantage to having only tiger shrimps in the experiment. Explain why this is an advantage.\n\nGive one statistical disadvantage to having only tiger shrimps in the experiment. Explain why this is a disadvantage.",
