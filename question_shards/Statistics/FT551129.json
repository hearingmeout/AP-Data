    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nTo determine the amount of sugar in a typical serving of breakfast cereal, a student randomly selected 60 boxes of different types of cereal from the shelves of a large grocery store.\n\nThe student noticed that the side panels of some of the cereal boxes showed sugar content based on one-cup servings, while others showed sugar content based on three-quarter-cup servings. Many of the cereal boxes with side panels that showed three-quarter-cup servings were ones that appealed to young children, and the student wondered whether there might be some difference in the sugar content of the cereals that showed different-size servings on their side panels. To investigate the question, the data were separated into two groups. One group consisted of 29 cereals that showed one-cup serving sizes; the other group consisted of 31 cereals that showed three-quarter-cup serving sizes. The boxplots shown below display sugar content (in grams) per serving of the cereals for each of the two serving sizes.\n\na. Write a few sentences to compare the distributions of sugar content per serving for the two serving sizes of cereals.\n\nAfter analyzing the boxplots on the preceding page, the student decided that instead of a comparison of sugar content per recommended serving, it might be more appropriate to compare sugar content for equal-size servings. To compare the amount of sugar in serving sizes of one cup each, the amount of sugar in each of the cereals showing three-quarter-cup servings on their side panels was multiplied by 4/3. The bottom boxplot shown below displays sugar content (in grams) per cup for those cereals that showed a serving size of three-quarter-cup on their side panels.\n\nb. What new information about sugar content do the boxplots above provide?\n\nc. Based on the boxplots shown above on this page, how would you expect the mean amounts of sugar per cup to compare for the different recommended serving sizes? Explain.",
