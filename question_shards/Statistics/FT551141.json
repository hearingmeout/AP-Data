    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nAdministrators in a large school district wanted to determine whether students who attended a new magnet school for one year achieved greater improvement in science test performance than students who did not attend the magnet school. Knowing that more parents would want to enroll their children in the magnet school than there was space available for those children, the district administrators decided to conduct a lottery of all families who expressed interest in participating. In their data analysis, the administrators would then compare the change in test scores of those children who were selected to attend the magnet school with the change in test scores of those who applied to attend the magnet school but who were not selected.\n\nThe tables below show the scores on the same science pretest and the same science posttest for 20 students. Of the 20 students, 8 were randomly selected from the magnet school and 12 were randomly selected from those who applied to attend the magnet school but who were not selected and then attended their original school.\n\nPerform a test to determine whether students who attend the magnet school demonstrate a significantly higher mean difference in test scores (Posttest – Pretest) than students who applied to attend the magnet school but who were not selected and then attended their original school.\n\nAdministrators were also interested in using pretest scores on this test as a predictor of posttest scores on the test. The following computer output contains the results from separate regression analyses on the magnet school scores and on the original school scores. The accompanying graph displays the data and separate regression lines for the magnet and original schools.\n\nb.\n\nState the equation of the regression line for the magnet school and interpret its slope in the context of the question.\n\nState the equation of the regression line for the original school and interpret its slope in the context of the question.\n\nc. To determine whether there is a significant correlation between pretest score and posttest score, a test of the following hypotheses will be performed.\n\nH0 : There is no correlation between pretest score and posttest score (true slope = 0) versus\n\nHa : There is a correlation between pretest score and posttest score (true slope ≠ 0)\n\nUsing the regression output, state the p-value and conclusion for this test at the magnet school. Assume the conditions for inference have been met.\n\nUsing the regression output, state the p-value and conclusion for this test at the original school. Assume the conditions for inference have been met.\n\nd. What additional information do the regression analyses give you about student performance on the science test at the two schools beyond the comparison of mean differences in part (a) ?",
