Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA simple random sample of 100 high school seniors was selected from a large school district. The gender of each student was recorded, and each student was asked the following questions.\n\n1. Have you ever had a part-time job?\n\n2. If you answered yes to the previous question, was your part-time job in the summer only?\n\nThe responses are summarized in the table below.\n\nOn the grid below, construct a graphical display that represents the association between gender and job experience for the students in the sample.\n\nWrite a few sentences summarizing what the display in part (a) reveals about the association between gender and job experience for the students in the sample.\n\nWhich test of significance should be used to test if there is an association between gender and job experience for the population of high school seniors in the district?\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses for the test, but do not perform the test.",
