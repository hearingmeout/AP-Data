    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nAn automobile company wants to learn about customer satisfaction among the owners of five specific car models. Large sales volumes have been recorded for three of the models, but the other two models were recently introduced so their sales volumes are smaller. The number of new cars sold in the last six months for each of the models is shown in the table below.\n\nThe company can obtain a list of all individuals who purchased new cars in the last six months for each of the five models shown in the table. The company wants to sample 2,000 of these owners.\n\nFor simple random samples of 2,000 new car owners, what is the expected number of owners of model E and the standard deviation of the number of owners of model E?\n\nWhen selecting a simple random sample of 2,000 new car owners, how likely is it that fewer than 12 owners of model E would be included in the sample? Justify your answer.\n\nThe company is concerned that a simple random sample of 2,000 owners would include fewer than 12 owners of model D or fewer than 12 owners of model E. Briefly describe a sampling method for randomly selecting 2,000 owners that will ensure at least 12 owners will be selected for each of the 5 car models.",
