    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA large pet store buys the identical species of adult tropical fish from two different suppliers—Buy-Rite Pets and Fish Friends. Several of the managers at the pet store suspect that the lengths of the fish from Fish Friends are consistently greater than the lengths of the fish from Buy-Rite Pets. Random samples of 8 adult fish of the species from Buy-Rite Pets and 10 adult fish of the same species from Fish Friends were selected and the lengths of the fish, in inches, were recorded, as shown in the table below.\n\nDo the data provide convincing evidence that the mean length of the adult fish of the species from Fish Friends is greater than the mean length of the adult fish of the same species from Buy-Rite Pets?",
