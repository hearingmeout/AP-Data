    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nNine sales representatives, 6 men and 3 women, at a small company wanted to attend a national convention. There were only enough travel funds to send 3 people. The manager selected 3 people to attend and stated that the people were selected at random. The 3 people selected were women. There were concerns that no men were selected to attend the convention.\n\nCalculate the probability that randomly selecting 3 people from a group of 6 men and 3 women will result in selecting 3 women.\n\nBased on your answer to part (a), is there reason to doubt the manager’s claim that the 3 people were selected at random? Explain.\n\nAn alternative to calculating the exact probability is to conduct a simulation to estimate the probability. A proposed simulation process is described below.\n\nEach trial in the simulation consists of rolling three fair, six-sided dice, one die for each of the convention attendees. For each die, rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4 represents selecting a man; rolling a 5 or 6 represents selecting a woman. After 1,000 trials, the number of times the dice indicate selecting 3 women is recorded.\n\nDoes the proposed process correctly simulate the random selection of 3 women from a group of 9 people consisting of 6 men and 3 women? Explain why or why not.",
