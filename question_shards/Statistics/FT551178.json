    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA student measured the heights and the arm spans, rounded to the nearest inch, of each person in a random sample of 12 seniors at a high school. A scatterplot of arm span versus height for the 12 seniors is shown.\n\nBased on the scatterplot, describe the relationship between arm span and height for the sample of 12 seniors.\n\nLet x represent height, in inches, and let y represent arm span, in inches. Two scatterplots of the same data are shown below. Graph 1 shows the data with the least squares regression line ˆy = 11.74 + 0.8247x, and graph 2 shows the data with the line y = x.\n\nThe criteria described in the table below can be used to classify people into one of three body shape categories: square, tall rectangle, or short rectangle.\n\nFor which graph, 1 or 2, is the line helpful in classifying a student’s body shape as square, tall rectangle, or short rectangle? Explain.\n\nComplete the table of classifications for the 12 seniors.\n\nUsing the best model for prediction, calculate the predicted arm span for a senior with height 61 inches.",
