    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Product advertisers studied the effects of television ads on children’s choices for two new snacks. The advertisers used two 30-second television ads in an experiment. One ad was for a new sugary snack called Choco-Zuties, and the other ad was for a new healthy snack called Apple-Zuties. For the experiment, 75 children were randomly assigned to one of three groups, A, B, or C. Each child individually watched a 30-minute television program that was interrupted for 5 minutes of advertising. The advertising was the same for each group with the following exceptions. The advertising for group A included the Choco-Zuties ad but not the Apple-Zuties ad. The advertising for group B included the Apple-Zuties ad but not the Choco-Zuties ad. The advertising for group C included neither the Choco-Zuties ad nor the Apple-Zuties ad. After the program, the children were offered a choice between the two snacks. The table below summarizes their choices. Do the data provide convincing statistical evidence that there is an association between type of ad and children’s choice of snack among all children similar to those who participated in the experiment? Write a few sentences describing the effect of each ad on children’s choice of snack.",
