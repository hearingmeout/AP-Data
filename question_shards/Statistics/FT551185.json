    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA newspaper in Germany reported that the more semesters needed to complete an academic program at the university, the greater the starting salary in the first year of a job. The report was based on a study that used a random sample of 24 people who had recently completed an academic program. Information was collected on the number of semesters each person in the sample needed to complete the program and the starting salary, in thousands of euros, for the first year of a job. The data are shown in the scatterplot below.\n\nDoes the scatterplot support the newspaper report about number of semesters and starting salary? Justify your answer.\n\nThe table below shows computer output from a linear regression analysis on the data.\n\nIdentify the slope of the least-squares regression line, and interpret the slope in context.\n\nAn independent researcher received the data from the newspaper and conducted a new analysis by separating the data into three groups based on the major of each person. A revised scatterplot identifying the major of each person is shown below.\n\nBased on the people in the sample, describe the association between starting salary and number of semesters for the business majors.\n\nBased on the people in the sample, compare the median starting salaries for the three majors.\n\nBased on the analysis conducted by the independent researcher, how could the newspaper report be modified to give a better description of the relationship between the number of semesters and the starting salary for the people in the sample?",
