    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nA simple random sample of adults living in a suburb of a large city was selected. The age and annual income of each adult in the sample were recorded. The resulting data are summarized in the table below.\n\nWhat is the probability that a person chosen at random from those in this sample will be in the 31-45 age category?\n\nWhat is the probability that a person chosen at random from those in this sample whose incomes are over $50,000 will be in the 31-45 age category? Show your work.\n\nBased on your answers to parts (a) and (b), is annual income independent of age category for those in this sample? Explain.",
