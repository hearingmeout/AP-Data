    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nA researcher thinks that modern Thai dogs may be descendants of golden jackals. A random sample of 16 animals was collected from each of the two populations. The length (in millimeters) of the mandible (jawbone) was measured for each animal. The lower quartile, median, and upper quartile for each sample are shown in the table below, along with all values below the lower quartile and all values above the upper quartile.\n\nDisplay parallel boxplots of mandible lengths (showing outliers, if any) for the modern Thai dogs and the golden jackals on the grid below.\n\nBased on the boxplots, write a few sentences comparing the distributions of mandible lengths for the two types of dogs.\n\nIs it reasonable to use the sample of mandible lengths of modern Thai dogs to construct an interval estimate of the mean mandible length for the population of modern Thai dogs? Justify your answer. (Note: You do not have to compute the interval.)\n\nIs it reasonable to use the sample data of mandible lengths of modern Thai dogs and the sample data of mandible lengths of golden jackals to perform a two-sample t-test for the difference in mean mandible lengths for the two types of dogs? Justify your answer. (Note: You do not have to conduct the test.)",
