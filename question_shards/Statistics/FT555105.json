Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nThe graph below displays the scores of 32 students on a recent exam. Scores on this exam ranged from 64 to 95 points.\n\nDescribe the shape of this distribution.\n\nIn order to motivate her students, the instructor of the class wants to report that, overall, the class’s performance on the exam was high. Which summary statistic, the mean or the median, should the instructor use to report that overall exam performance was high? Explain.\n\nThe midrange is defined as (maximum + minimum) / 2. Compute this value using the data on the preceding page.\n\nIs the midrange considered a measure of center or a measure of spread? Explain.",
