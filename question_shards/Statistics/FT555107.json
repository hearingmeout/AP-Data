    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nFor an upcoming concert, each customer may purchase up to 3 child tickets and 3 adult tickets. Let C be the number of child tickets purchased by a single customer. The probability distribution of the number of child tickets purchased by a single customer is given in the table below.\n\nCompute the mean and the standard deviation of C.\n\nSuppose the mean and the standard deviation for the number of adult tickets purchased by a single customer are 2 and 1.2, respectively. Assume that the numbers of child tickets and adult tickets purchased are independent random variables. Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the total number of adult and child tickets purchased by a single customer.\n\nSuppose each child ticket costs $15 and each adult ticket costs $25. Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the total amount spent per purchase.",
