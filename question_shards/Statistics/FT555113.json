    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nJohn believes that as he increases his walking speed, his pulse rate will increase. He wants to model this relationship. John records his pulse rate, in beats per minute (bpm), while walking at each of seven different speeds, in miles per hour (mph). A scatterplot and regression output are shown below.\n\nUsing the regression output, write the equation of the fitted regression line.\n\nDo your estimates of the slope and intercept parameters have meaningful interpretations in the context of this question? If so, provide interpretations in this context. If not, explain why not.\n\nJohn wants to provide a 98 percent confidence interval for the slope parameter in his final report. Compute the margin of error that John should use. Assume that conditions for inference are satisfied.",
