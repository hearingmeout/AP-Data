    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.A large company has two shifts—a day shift and a night shift. Parts produced by the two shifts must meet the same specifications. The manager of the company believes that there is a difference in the proportions of parts produced within specifications by the two shifts. To investigate this belief, random samples of parts that were produced on each of these shifts were selected. For the day shift, 188 of its 200 selected parts met specifications. For the night shift, 180 of its 200 selected parts met specifications.Use a 96 percent confidence interval to estimate the difference in the proportions of parts produced within specifications by the two shifts.Based only on this confidence interval, do you think that the difference in the proportions of parts produced within specifications by the two shifts is significantly different from 0 ? Justify your answer.",
