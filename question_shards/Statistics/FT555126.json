    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nThe developers of a training program designed to improve manual dexterity claim that people who complete the 6-week program will increase their manual dexterity. A random sample of 12 people enrolled in the training program was selected. A measure of each person’s dexterity on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest) was recorded just before the start of and just after the completion of the 6-week program. The data are shown in the table below.\n\nCan one conclude that the mean manual dexterity for people who have completed the 6-week training program has significantly increased? Support your conclusion with appropriate statistical evidence.",
