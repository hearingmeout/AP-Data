    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nEach of 25 adult women was asked to provide her own height (y), in inches, and the height (x), in inches, of her father. The scatterplot below displays the results. Only 22 of the 25 pairs are distinguishable because some of the (x,y) pairs were the same. The equation of the least squares regression line is ŷ = 35.1 + 0.427x.\n\nDraw the least squares regression line on the scatterplot above.\n\nOne father’s height was x = 67 inches and his daughter’s height was y = 61 inches. Circle the point on the scatterplot above that represents this pair and draw the segment on the scatterplot that corresponds to the residual for it. Give a numerical value for the residual.\n\nSuppose the point x = 84 , y = 71 is added to the data set. Would the slope of the least squares regression line increase, decrease, or remain about the same? Explain.\n\n(Note: No calculations are necessary to answer this question.)\n\nWould the correlation increase, decrease, or remain about the same? Explain.\n\n(Note: No calculations are necessary to answer this question.)",
