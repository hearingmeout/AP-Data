    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.A researcher wants to conduct a study to test whether listening to soothing music for 20 minutes helps to reduce diastolic blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure, compared to simply sitting quietly in a noise-free environment for 20 minutes. One hundred patients with high blood pressure at a large medical clinic are available to participate in this study.Propose a design for this study to compare these two treatments.The null hypothesis for this study is that there is no difference in the mean reduction of diastolic blood pressure for the two treatments and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure is greater for the music treatment. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the clinic will offer this music therapy as a free service to their patients with high blood pressure. Describe Type I and Type II errors and the consequences of each in the context of this study, and discuss which one you think is more serious.",
