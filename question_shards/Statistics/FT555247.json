    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nAs a part of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Super Dump cleanup efforts in the early 1990s, various sites in the country were targeted for cleanup. Three of the targeted sites—River X, River Y, and River Z—had become contaminated with pesticides because they were located near abandoned pesticide dump sites. Measurements of the concentration of aldrin (a commonly used pesticide) were taken at twenty randomly selected locations in each river near the dump sites.\n\nThe boxplots shown below display the five-number summaries for the concentrations, in parts per million (ppm) of aldrin, for the twenty locations that were sampled in each of the three rivers.\n\nCompare the distributions of the concentration of aldrin among the three rivers.\n\nThe twenty concentrations of aldrin for River X are given below.\n\nConstruct a stemplot that displays the concentrations of aldrin for River X.\n\nDescribe a characteristic of the distribution of aldrin concentrations in River X that can be seen in the stemplot but cannot be seen in the boxplot.",
