    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.A husband and wife, Mike and Lori, share a digital music player that has a feature that randomly selects which song to play. A total of 2,384 songs were loaded onto the player, some by Mike and the rest by Lori. Suppose that when the player was in the random-selection mode, 13 of the first 50 songs selected were songs loaded by Lori.Construct and interpret a 90 percent confidence interval for the proportion of songs on the player that were loaded by Lori.Mike and Lori are unsure about whether the player samples the songs with replacement or without replacement when the player is in random-selection mode. Explain why this distinction is not important for the construction of the interval in part (a).",
