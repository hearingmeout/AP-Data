    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nRecords are kept by each state in the United States on the number of pupils enrolled in public schools and the number of teachers employed by public schools for each school year. From these records, the ratio of the number of pupils to the number of teachers (P-T ratio) can be calculated for each state. The histograms below show the P-T ratio for every state during the 2001–2002 school year. The histogram on the left displays the ratios for the 24 states that are west of the Mississippi River, and the histogram on the right displays the ratios for the 26 states that are east of the Mississippi River.\n\nDescribe how you would use the histograms to estimate the median P-T ratio for each group (west and east) of states. Then use this procedure to estimate the median of the west group and the median of the east group.\n\nWrite a few sentences comparing the distributions of P-T ratios for states in the two groups (west and east) during the 2001–2002 school year.\n\nUsing your answers in parts (a) and (b), explain how you think the mean P-T ratio during the 2001–2002 school year will compare for the two groups (west and east).",
