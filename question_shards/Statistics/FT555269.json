    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nAn airline claims that there is a 0.10 probability that a coach-class ticket holder who flies frequently will be upgraded to first class on any flight. This outcome is independent from flight to flight. Sam is a frequent flier who always purchases coach-class tickets.\n\nWhat is the probability that Sam’s first upgrade will occur after the third flight?\n\nWhat is the probability that Sam will be upgraded exactly 2 times in his next 20 flights?\n\nSam will take 104 flights next year. Would you be surprised if Sam receives more than 20 upgrades to first class during the year? Justify your answer.",
