    "question": "Researchers studying a pack of gray wolves in North America collected data on the length x, in meters, from nose to tip of tail, and the weight y, in kilograms, of the wolves. A scatterplot of weight versus length revealed a relationship between the two variables described as positive, linear, and strong. For the situation described above, explain what is meant by each of the following words. Positive: Linear: Strong: The data collected from the wolves were used to create the least-squares equation ŷ = -16.46 + 35.02 x. Interpret the meaning of the slope of the least-squares regression line in context. One wolf in the pack with a length of 1.4 meters had a residual of -9.67 kilograms. What was the weight of the wolf?",
