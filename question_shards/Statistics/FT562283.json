    "question": "A grocery store purchases melons from two distributors, J and K. Distributor J provides melons from organic farms. The distribution of the diameters of the melons from Distributor J is approximately normal with mean 133 millimeters (mm) and standard deviation 5 mm.\n\nFor a melon selected at random from Distributor J, what is the probability that the melon will have a diameter greater than 137 mm?  Distributor K provides melons from nonorganic farms. The probability is 0.8413 that a melon selected at random from Distributor K will have a diameter greater than 137 mm. For all the melons at the grocery store, 70 percent of the melons are provided by Distributor J and 30 percent are provided by Distributor K.\n\nFor a melon selected at random from the grocery store, what is the probability that the melon will have a diameter greater than 137 mm?\n\nGiven that a melon selected at random from the grocery store has a diameter greater than 137 mm, what is the probability that the melon will be from Distributor J?",
