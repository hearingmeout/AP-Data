    "question": "Consider an experiment in which two men and two women will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group in such a way that each group has two people. The people are identified as Man 1, Man 2, Woman 1, and Woman 2. The six possible arrangements are shown below.\n\nTwo possible methods of assignment are being considered: the sequential coin flip method, as described in part (a), and the chip method, as described in part (b). For each method, the order of the assignment will be Man 1, Man 2, Woman 1, Woman 2.\n\nFor the sequential coin flip method, a fair coin is flipped until one group has two people. An outcome of tails assigns the person to the treatment group, and an outcome of heads assigns the person to the control group. As soon as one group has two people, the remaining people are automatically assigned to the other group.\n\nComplete the table below by calculating the probability of each arrangement occurring if the sequential coin flip method is used.\n\nFor the sequential coin flip method, what is the probability that Man 1 and Man 2 are assigned to the same group?\n\nThe six arrangements are repeated below.\n\nFor the chip method, two chips are marked “treatment” and two chips are marked “control.” Each person selects one chip at random without replacement.\n\nComplete the table below by calculating the probability of each arrangement occurring if the chip method is used.\n\nFor the chip method, what is the probability that Man 1 and Man 2 are assigned to the same group?\n\nSixteen participants consisting of 10 students and 6 teachers at an elementary school will be used for an experiment to determine lunch preference for the school population of students and teachers. As the participants enter the school cafeteria for lunch, they will be randomly assigned to receive one of two lunches so that 8 will receive a salad, and 8 will receive a grilled cheese sandwich. The students will enter the cafeteria first, and the teachers will enter next. Which method, the sequential coin flip method or the chip method, should be used to assign the treatments? Justify your choice.",
