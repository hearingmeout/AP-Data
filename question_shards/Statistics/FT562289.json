    "question": "Let V represent the event that Player V wins a set, and let M represent the event that Player M wins a set. List all possible sequences of events V and M by set played that will result in Player V winning the match. List all possible sequences of events V and M by set played that will result in Player M winning the match. Player V and Player M have competed against each other many times. Historical data show that each player is equally likely to win the first set. If Player V wins the first set, the probability that she will win the second set is 0.60. If Player V loses the first set, the probability that she will lose the second set is 0.70. If Player V wins exactly one of the first two sets, the probability that she will win the third set is 0.45. What is the probability that Player V will win a match against Player M? What is the probability that a match between Player V and Player M will consist of 3 sets given that Player V wins the match? What is the expected number of sets played when Player V competes in a match with Player M?",
