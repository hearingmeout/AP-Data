    "description": "A tropical storm is classified as major if it has sustained winds greater than 110 miles per hour. Based on data from the past two decades, a meteorologist estimated the following percentages about future storms.\n\n20% of all tropical storms will originate in the Atlantic Ocean, of which 20% will be classified as major.\n\n30% of all tropical storms will originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, of which 15% will be classified as major.\n\n50% of all tropical storms will originate in the western Pacific Ocean, of which 25% will be classified as major.",
    "question": "Based on the meteorologist’s estimates, approximately what is the probability that a future tropical storm will originate in the Pacific Ocean and be classified as major?",
