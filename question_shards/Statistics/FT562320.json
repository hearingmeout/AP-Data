    "description": "As part of a science experiment, a student recorded 10 measurements of the temperature of a liquid. One of the measurements was an outlier when compared with the other 9 measurements.\n\n(Note: An outlier is any number that is greater than the upper quartile or less than the lower quartile by at least 1.5 times the interquartile range.)",

      {
