    "description": "An agriculturalist working with Australian pine trees wanted to investigate the relationship between the age and the height of the Australian pine. A random sample of Australian pine trees was selected, and the age, in years, and the height, in meters, was recorded for each tree in the sample. Based on the recorded data, the agriculturalist created the following regression equation to predict the height, in meters, of the Australian pine based on the age, in years, of the tree.\n\npredicted height = 0.29 + 0.48(age)",
    "question": "Which of the following is the best interpretation of the slope of the regression line?",
