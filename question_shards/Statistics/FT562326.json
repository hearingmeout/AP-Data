    "description": "Researchers working for a certain airline are investigating the weight of carry-on bags. The researchers will use the mean weight of a random sample of 800 carry-on bags to estimate the mean weight of all carry-on bags for the airline.",
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the effect on the bias and the variance of the estimator if the researchers increase the sample size to 1,300?",

    "choices": [
