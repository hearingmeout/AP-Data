    "description": "Researchers investigated whether a new process for producing yarn could reduce the mean amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by carpet. From random samples of carpets, the researchers found the mean reduction of VOCs emitted by carpets made with yarn produced by the new process compared with that of carpets made with yarn produced by the traditional process was 13 parts per million (ppm). All conditions for inference were met, and the p-value for the appropriate hypothesis test was 0.095.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the p-value?",
    "image": null,
