    "description": "A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of taking a nutritional supplement on a person’s reaction time. One hundred volunteers were placed into one of three groups according to their athletic ability: low, moderate, or high. Participants in each group were randomly assigned to take either the nutritional supplement or a placebo for six weeks. At the end of the six weeks, participants were given a coordination task. The reaction time in completing the task was recorded for each participant. The study compared the reaction times between those taking the supplement and those taking the placebo within each athletic ability level.",
