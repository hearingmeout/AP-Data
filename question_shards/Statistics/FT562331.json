    "question": "A survey of a random sample of 210 male teens and 228 female teens, ages 13 years to 17 years, found that 122 of the male teens and 160 of the female teens brush their teeth at least twice a day. If there is no difference between the proportions in the population of all male and female teens ages 13 years to 17 years who brush their teeth at least twice a day, approximately how many males and females in the sample would be expected to brush their teeth at least twice a day?",
