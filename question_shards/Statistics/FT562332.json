    "description": "Researchers believed that an increase in lean body mass is associated with an increase in maximal oxygen uptake. A scatterplot of the measurements taken from 18 randomly selected college athletes displayed a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. A significance test for the null hypothesis that the slope of the regression line is 0 versus the alternative that the slope is greater than 0 yielded a p-value of 0.04.",
    "question": "Which statement is an appropriate conclusion for the test?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The p-value of 0.04 indicates that 4% of the variation in maximal oxygen uptake for college athletes can be explained by the amount of lean body mass.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The p-value of 0.04 indicates that 16% of the variation in maximal oxygen uptake for college athletes can be explained by the amount of lean body mass.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The strong positive linear relationship displayed in the scatterplot along with a p-value less than 0.05 indicates that college athletes with higher lean body mass tend to have higher maximal oxygen uptake.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The strong positive linear relationship displayed in the scatterplot along with a p-value less than 0.05 indicates that an increase in lean body mass causes an increase in maximal oxygen uptake for college athletes.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the relationship displayed in the scatterplot is likely due to chance, and that there is no statistical evidence of a relationship between lean body mass and maximal oxygen uptake for college athletes.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "The strong positive linear relationship displayed in the scatterplot along with a p-value less than 0.05 indicates that college athletes with higher lean body mass tend to have higher maximal oxygen uptake."
