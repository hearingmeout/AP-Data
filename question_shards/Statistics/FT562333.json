    "description": "An environmental group wanted to estimate the proportion of fresh produce sales identified as organic in a local grocery store. In the winter, the group obtained a random sample of sales from the store and used the data to construct the 95 percent z-interval for a proportion (0.087, 0.133). Six months later in the summer, the group obtained a second random sample of sales from the store. The second sample was the same size as the first, and the proportion of sales identified as organic was 0.4.",
    "question": "How does the 95 percent z-interval for a proportion constructed from the summer sample compare to the winter interval?",
