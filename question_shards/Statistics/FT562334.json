    "description": "In a standard golf tournament, golfers play 18 holes of golf on each of 4 consecutive days. For each hole, golfers keep track of the number of times they hit the ball (strokes) before the ball goes into the cup. A golfer’s score for the tournament is the total number of strokes needed to complete the tournament. The boxplots below summarize the scores for golfers who competed in tournament 1 and golfers who competed in tournament 2.",
    "question": "Based on the boxplots, which of the following statements must be true?",
