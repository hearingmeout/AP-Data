    "description": "Based on records kept at a gas station, the distribution of gallons of gas purchased by customers is skewed to the right with mean 10 gallons and standard deviation 4 gallons. A random sample of 64 customer receipts was selected, and the sample mean number of gallons was recorded. Suppose the process of selecting a random sample of 64 receipts and recording the sample mean number of gallons was repeated for a total of 100 samples.",
