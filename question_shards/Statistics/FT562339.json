    "description": "In a certain computer card game, the player is awarded 5 points for each card that is moved to a correct position. The player is penalized 10 points for each minute the game is played. Let the random variable X represent the number of cards moved to a correct position, and let the random variable Y represent the number of minutes the game is played. The means and standard deviations of the random variables for a particular player are shown in the table below.\n\nAssume that X and Y are independent.",
