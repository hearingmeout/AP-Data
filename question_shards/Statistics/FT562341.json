    "description": "A police officer uses a motion detector to indicate whether a car is traveling faster than the speed limit (speeding). A speeding ticket will be issued to the driver of the car if the officer believes the driver is speeding, as indicated by the detector. The situation is similar to using a null and an alternative hypothesis to decide whether to issue a ticket. The hypotheses can be stated as follows.\n\nH0 : The driver is not speeding.\n\nHa : The driver is speeding.",
