    "description": "In a physics experiment, two different methods were used to measure the angle of deflection when a subatomic particle collides with a certain material. Ten specimens of the material were used to compare the two methods. For each specimen, the angle of deflection was measured using both methods. For each specimen, the method used first was determined by the flip of a fair coin. The difference between the measured angles was calculated for each specimen. A test of the hypothesis that the population mean difference is zero had a p-value of 0.082.\n\nThe hypothesis test described had three components: the number of specimens, the sample standard deviation of the differences, and the magnitude of the sample mean difference.",
