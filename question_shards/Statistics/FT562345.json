    "description": "A survey was conducted in a large city to investigate public opinion on banning the use of trans fats in restaurant cooking. A random sample of 230 city residents with school-age children was selected, and another random sample of 341 city residents without school-age children was also selected. Of those with school-age children, 94 opposed the banning of trans fats, and of those without school-age children, 147 opposed the banning of trans fats. An appropriate hypothesis test was conducted to investigate whether there was a difference between the two groups of residents in their opposition to the banning of trans fats.",
    "question": "Is there convincing statistical evidence of a difference between the two population proportions at the significance level of 0.05?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the sample proportions are different.",

      {
        "label": "Yes, because the probability of observing a difference at least as large as the sample difference is greater than 0.05.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the probability of observing a difference at least as large as the sample difference, if the two population proportions are the same, is less than 0.05.",
