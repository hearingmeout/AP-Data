    "question": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the ligaments that help stabilize the knee. Surgery is often recommended if the ACL is completely torn, and recovery time from the surgery can be lengthy. A medical center developed a new surgical procedure designed to reduce the average recovery time from the surgery. To test the effectiveness of the new procedure, a study was conducted in which 210 patients needing surgery to repair a torn ACL were randomly assigned to receive either the standard procedure or the new procedure.\n\nBased on the design of the study, would a statistically significant result allow the medical center to conclude that the new procedure causes a reduction in recovery time compared to the standard procedure, for patients similar to those in the study? Explain your answer.\n\nSummary statistics on the recovery times from the surgery are shown in the table.\n\nDo the data provide convincing statistical evidence that those who receive the new procedure will have less recovery time from the surgery, on average, than those who receive the standard procedure, for patients similar to those in the study?",
