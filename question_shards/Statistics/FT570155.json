    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nIn 1915 Einstein’s theory predicted that the curvature of space, denoted by γ , was 1, while Newtonian theory predicted it was 0. Since 1915 scientists have repeatedly found estimates of γ using various methods and procedures. Each estimate has a margin of error. The figure below displays\n\n(estimate ± margin of error)\n\nfrom each of 21 experiments.\n\nBased on the display on page 6, describe how the precision of the estimates of γ has changed over time.\n\nWrite a few sentences describing the strength of evidence the experiments provide for the claim from Newtonian theory that γ = 0. Your response must include justification based on the display.\n\nWrite a few sentences describing the strength of evidence the experiments provide for the claim from Einstein’s theory that γ = 1. Your response must include justification based on the display.",
