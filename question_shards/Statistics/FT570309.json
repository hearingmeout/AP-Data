    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nAirlines routinely overbook flights because they expect a certain number of no-shows. An airline runs a 5 P.M. commuter flight from Washington, D.C., to New York City on a plane that holds 38 passengers. Past experience has shown that if 41 tickets are sold for the flight, then the probability distribution for the number who actually show up for the flight is as shown in the table below.\n\nAssume that 41 tickets are sold for each flight.\n\nThere are 38 passenger seats on the flight. What is the probability that all passengers who show up for this flight will get a seat?\n\nWhat is the expected number of no-shows for this flight?\n\nGiven that not all passenger seats are filled on a flight, what is the probability that only 36 passengers showed up for the flight?",
