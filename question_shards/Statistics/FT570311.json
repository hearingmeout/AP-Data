    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.\n\nA preliminary study conducted at a medical center in St. Louis has shown that treatment with small, low-intensity magnets reduces the self-reported level of pain in polio patients. During each session, a patient rested on an examining table in the doctor’s office while the magnets, embedded in soft pads, were strapped to the body at the site of pain. Sessions continued for several weeks, after which pain reduction was measured.\n\nA new study is being designed to investigate whether magnets also reduce pain in patients suffering from herniated disks in the lower back. One hundred male patients are available for the new study.\n\nDescribe an appropriate design for the new study. Your discussion should briefly address treatments used, methods of treatment assignment, and what variables would be measured. Do not describe how the data would be analyzed.\n\nWould you modify the design above if, instead of 100 male patients, there were 50 male and 50 female patients available for the study? If so, how would you modify your design? If not, why not?",
