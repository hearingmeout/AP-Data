Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. At a school field day, 50 students and 50 faculty members each completed an obstacle course. Descriptive statistics for the completion times (in minutes) for the two groups are shown below. Use the same scale to draw boxplots for the completion times for students and for faculty members. Write a few sentences comparing the variability of the two distributions. You have been asked to report on this event for the school newspaper. Write a few sentences describing student and faculty performances in this competition for the paper.",
