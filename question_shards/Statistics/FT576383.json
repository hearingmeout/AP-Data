    "description": "The manager of a restaurant tracks the types of dinners that customers order from the menu to ensure that the correct amount of food is ordered from the supplier each week. Data from customer orders last year suggest the following weekly distribution.\n\nThe manager believes that there might be a change in the distribution from last year to this year. A random sample of 200 orders was taken from all customer orders placed last week. The following table shows the results of the sample.\n\nAssume each order is independent.",
    "question": "Assume each order is independent. For which type of dinner is the value of its contribution to the appropriate test statistic the greatest?",
