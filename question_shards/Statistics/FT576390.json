    "description": "A marketing firm obtained random samples of 20 people in five regions of the country to investigate the level of interest in a new product. People in the sample were asked to rate their level of interest on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the least amount of interest and 10 being the greatest. The histograms show the results for each region.",
    "question": "The graph for which region displays data for level of interest with the least standard deviation?",
