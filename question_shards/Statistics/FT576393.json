    "description": "New employees at a large corporation go through a training program during their first week of employment. The new employees take a written assessment at the completion of the program to determine how well prepared they are for their jobs. A score greater than the mean indicates a well-prepared employee. Assume the following distributions of new employee scores have the same mean score, the same maximum score, and the same minimum score.",
