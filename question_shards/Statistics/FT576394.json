    "description": "Based on his past record, Luke, an archer for a college archery team, has a probability of 0.90 of hitting the inner ring of the target with a shot of the arrow. Assume that in one practice Luke will attempt 5 shots of the arrow and that each shot is independent from the others. Let the random variable X represent the number of times he hits the inner ring of the target in 5 attempts. The probability distribution of X is given in the table.",
    "question": "What is the probability that the number of times Luke will hit the inner ring of the target out of the 5 attempts is less than the mean of X?",
