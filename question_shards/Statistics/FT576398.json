    "description": "A study will be conducted to examine a new medicine intended to reduce high blood pressure in adult men who have high blood pressure. As part of the study, a random sample of 40 men with high blood pressure will have their blood pressure measured, and then they will take the new medicine every day for one month. At the end of the month, their blood pressure will be measured again.",
    "question": "Of the following, which is the best procedure to investigate whether there will be convincing statistical evidence of a change, on average, in blood pressure for men with high blood pressure who take the new medicine?",
