  "content": {
    "description": "A roadrunner is a desert bird that tends to run instead of fly. While running, the roadrunner uses its tail as a balance. A sample of 10 roadrunners was taken, and the birds’ total length, in centimeters (cm), and tail length, in cm, were recorded. The output shown in the table is from a least-squares regression to predict tail length given total length.\n\nSuppose a roadrunner has a total length of 59.0 cm and tail length of 31.1 cm.",
    "question": "Based on the residual, does the regression model overestimate or underestimate the tail length of the roadrunner?",
