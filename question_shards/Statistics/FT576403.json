    "description": "Researchers conducted a study to investigate the effects of soft drink consumption on fat stored in muscle tissue. From a sample of 80 adult volunteers, 40 were randomly assigned to consume one liter of a soft drink each day. The remaining 40 were asked to drink one liter of water each day and not to consume any soft drinks. At the end of six months, the amount of fat stored in each person’s muscle tissue was recorded. The people in the group who drank the soft drink had, on average, a higher percentage of fat stored in the tissue than the people who drank only water.",
