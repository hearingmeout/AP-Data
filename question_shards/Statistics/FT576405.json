    "description": "A manufacturer of cell phone batteries claims that the average number of recharge cycles for its batteries is 400. A consumer group will obtain a random sample of 100 of the manufacturer’s batteries and will calculate the mean number of recharge cycles.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements is justified by the central limit theorem?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The distribution of the number of recharge cycles for the sample is approximately normal because the population mean of 400 is greater than 30.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The distribution of the number of recharge cycles for the sample is approximately normal because the sample size of 100 is greater than 30.",
        "image": null
      },

        "label": "The distribution of the number of recharge cycles for the population is approximately normal because the sample size of 100 is greater than 30.",
