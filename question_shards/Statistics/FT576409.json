    "description": "According to a recent report, customers who shop at a certain online store spend, on average, $1,500 a year at the store. To investigate whether the mean amount spent was greater than the reported average, an economist obtained the mean and standard deviation of the amount spent in the past year by a random sample of 120 customers who shop at the store. With all conditions for inference met, the economist conducted the appropriate hypothesis test and obtained a p-value of 0.25.",
