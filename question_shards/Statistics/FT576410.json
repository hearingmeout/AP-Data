    "description": "Scientists working for a water district measure the water level in a lake each day. The daily water level in the lake varies due to weather conditions and other factors. The daily water level has a distribution that is approximately normal with mean water level of 84.07 feet. The probability that the daily water level in the lake is at least 100 feet is 0.064.",
    "question": "Which of the following is closest to the probability that on a randomly selected day the water level in the lake will be at least 90 feet?",
