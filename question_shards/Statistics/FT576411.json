    "description": "The president of a large company recommends that employees perform, on average, 24 hours of community service each year. The president believes that the mean number of hours of community service performed last year was different from the recommended 24 hours. To estimate the mean number of hours of community service performed last year, the president obtained data from a random sample of employees and used the data to construct the 95 percent confidence interval (20.37, 23.49).",
