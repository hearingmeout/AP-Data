    "description": "A doctor uses a new diagnostic test to indicate whether a patient has a certain disease. The doctor will prescribe medication for the patient if the doctor believes the patient has the disease, as indicated by the diagnostic test. The situation is similar to using a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis to decide whether to prescribe the medication. The hypotheses can be stated as follows.\n\n<math> <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mtext>H</mtext> <mn>0</mn> </msub> </mrow> <annotation encoding=\"MathType-MTEF\">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaagCart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLnhiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq=Jc9vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0=yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr=xfr=xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaaeisamaaBaaaleaacaaIWaaabeaaaaa@37A5@</annotation> </semantics> </math> : The patient does not have the disease.\n\n<math> <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mtext>H</mtext> <mtext>a</mtext> </msub> </mrow> <annotation encoding=\"MathType-MTEF\">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaagCart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLnhiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq=Jc9vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0=yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr=xfr=xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaaeisamaaBaaaleaacaqGHbaabeaaaaa@37CF@</annotation> </semantics> </math> : The patient has the disease.",
