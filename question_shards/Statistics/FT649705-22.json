    "description": "Activity trackers are electronic devices that people wear to record physical activity. Researchers wanted to estimate the mean number of steps taken on a typical workday for people working in New York City who wear such trackers. A random sample of 61 people working in New York City who wear an activity tracker was selected. The number of steps taken on a typical workday for each person in the sample was recorded. The mean was 9,797 steps and the standard deviation was 2,313 steps.",
    "question": "(a) Construct and interpret a 99 percent confidence interval for the mean number of steps taken on a typical workday for all people working in New York City who wear an activity tracker.",

Is it appropriate to use the confidence interval found in part (a) to conduct the investigation? Explain your answer.",
