    "question": "An observational study found that the amount of sleep an employee gets each night is associated with job performance. The correlation coefficient was found to be <math alttext=\"r equals 0.86\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.86</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. A reader of the study concluded that more sleep causes employees to perform better. Why is such a conclusion not correct?",
