    "question": "A botanist collected one leaf at random from each of 10 randomly selected mature maple trees of the same species. The mean and the standard deviation of the surface areas for the 10 leaves in the sample were computed.Assume the distribution of surface areas of maple leaves is normal. What is the appropriate method for constructing a one-sample confidence interval to estimate the population mean surface area of the species of maple leaves, and why is the method appropriate?",

      {
        "label": "The t-interval is appropriate, because the population standard deviation is not known.",
