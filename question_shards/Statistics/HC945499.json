    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. An educational researcher has noticed that because many students can type faster than they can write, lecture notes taken by students using laptops tend to look like a transcript of the instructor’s lecture, while handwritten lecture notes tend to be shorter summaries of the key points made during the lecture. The researcher wants to investigate whether the difference in note-taking methods has an impact on student quiz performance and is considering the following two proposals for the investigation. Proposal <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>I</mtext></math>: The researcher will select a random sample of students from a list of volunteers and allow the students to use their preferred note-taking method, laptops or handwritten. Proposal <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>II</mtext></math>: The researcher will randomly assign the note-taking method (laptops or handwritten) to each student in a group of volunteers, so that half of the volunteers are assigned to each method. (a) Which of the two proposals is not an experiment? Justify your answer.",
