    "description": "A medical researcher conducted a study to investigate the effectiveness of two drugs, L and M, designed to reduce the number of seizures that people with epilepsy might have. Each person in a group of <math alttext=\"120\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>120</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> adult volunteers who had epilepsy was randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those assigned to one group took drug L for one year, and those assigned to the other group took drug M for one year. Each participant recorded the number of seizures that occurred during the year.",
    "question": "To which group is it most reasonable to generalize the results of this study?",
