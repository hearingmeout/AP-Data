    "question": "A contestant’s final winnings on a game show are determined by a random selection of a base amount and a possible multiplier. For the base amount, the contestant randomly selects one of four cards, where two cards are marked $1,000, one card is marked $2,000, and one card is marked $5,000. After choosing the card, the contestant randomly selects one of five chips, where three chips are red and two chips are white. If the selected chip is red, the contestant’s final winnings are twice the value of the base amount. If the selected chip is white, the contestant’s final winnings are the value of the base amount. What is the probability that a contestant’s final winnings are exactly $2,000?",
