    "question": "The owner of a food store conducted a study to investigate whether displaying organic fruit at the front of the store rather than at the back of the store will increase sales of the fruit. At the beginning of each week, the organic fruit display was randomly assigned to either the front or the back of the store, and sales for the week were recorded. At the end of 12 months, the owner determined that the average weekly sales of organic fruit displayed at the front of the store were greater than the average weekly sales of organic fruit displayed at the back of the store. The difference was statistically significant. What can be concluded from the study?",
