    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Patients with heart-attack symptoms arrive at an emergency room either by ambulance or self-transportation provided by themselves, family, or friends. When a patient arrives at the emergency room, the time of arrival is recorded. The time when the patient’s diagnostic treatment begins is also recorded. An administrator of a large hospital wanted to determine whether the mean wait time (time between arrival and diagnostic treatment) for patients with heart-attack symptoms differs according to the mode of transportation. A random sample of 150 patients with heart-attack symptoms who had reported to the emergency room was selected. For each patient, the mode of transportation and wait time were recorded. Summary statistics for each mode of transportation are shown in the table below. Use a 99 percent confidence interval to estimate the difference between the mean wait times for ambulance transported patients and self-transported patients at this emergency room. Based only on this confidence interval, do you think the difference in the mean wait times is statistically significant? Justify your answer.",
