    "description": "Consider two populations of coins, one of pennies and one of quarters. A random sample of 25 pennies was selected, and the mean age of the sample was 32 years. A random sample of 35 quarters was taken, and the mean age of the sample was 19 years.",
    "question": "For the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means, have the conditions for normality been met?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, the conditions for normality have been met because the distributions of age for the two populations are approximately normal.",

      {
        "label": "Yes, the conditions for normality have been met because the sample sizes taken from both populations are large enough.",

      {
        "label": "No, the conditions for normality have not been met because neither sample size is large enough and no information is given about the distributions of the populations.",
