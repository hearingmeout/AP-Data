    "question": "A book club wonders if fewer than 40 percent of students at a local university had read at least one book during the last year. To test the claim, the book club selected a random sample of students at the local university and recorded the number of students who had read at least one book during the last year. The club conducted a test with the hypotheses <math alttext=\"H sub 0: p equals 0.40\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>H</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>:</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.40</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> versus <math alttext=\"H sub a: p is less than 0.40\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>H</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>a</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>:</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0.40</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. The test yielded a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.033. Assuming all conditions for inference were met, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?",
