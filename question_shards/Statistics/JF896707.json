    "description": "Biologists were studying the proportions of cats that had spotted markings on their fur in two populations of cats, C and F. An independent random sample of cats was taken from each population, and the difference between the sample proportions of cats with the spotted markings (C minus F) was 0.62. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis being that the population proportions are not equal. The <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test was 0.01.",
