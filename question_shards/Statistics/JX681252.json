A field will be divided into <math alttext=\"54\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>54</mn></math> equally sized plots of land, and the <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> fertilizer strengths will be randomly assigned so that <math alttext=\"27\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>27</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> plots will be fertilized with low strength and <math alttext=\"27\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>27</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> plots with high strength. The same type and amount of corn will be planted in each plot at the same time. The yield (amount of corn produced) will be measured for each plot.",
