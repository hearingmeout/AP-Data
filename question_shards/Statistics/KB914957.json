    "description": "A car retailer wanted to see if there is a linear relationship between overall mileage and the suggested retail price of a car. The retailer collected data on 18 cars of a similar type selected at random and used the data to test the claim that there is a linear relationship. The following hypotheses were used to test the claim.",
