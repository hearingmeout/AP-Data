    "question": "Past studies indicate that about 60 percent of the trees in a forested region are classified as softwood. A botanist studying the region suspects that the proportion might be greater than 0.60. The botanist obtained a random sample of trees from the region and conducted a test of <math alttext=\"H sub 0: p equals 0.6\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>H</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>:</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.6</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> versus <math alttext=\"H sub a: p is greater than 0.6\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>H</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>a</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>:</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0.6</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. The <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test was 0.015.
