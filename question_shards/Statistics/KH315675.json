    "description": "A consumer group is investigating the number of flights at a certain airline that are overbooked. They conducted a simulation to estimate the probability of overbooked flights in the next 5 flights. The results of 1,000 trials are shown in the following histogram.",
    "question": "Based on the histogram, what is the probability that at least 4 of the next 5 flights at the airline will be overbooked?",
