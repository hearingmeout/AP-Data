    "question": "A national health study reported that the proportion of students with elevated blood pressure is 0.15. The principal of a local high school believes that the proportion of students in the school with elevated blood pressure is greater than 0.15. If a large random sample is used, which of the following is the most appropriate test to investigate the principal’s belief?",
