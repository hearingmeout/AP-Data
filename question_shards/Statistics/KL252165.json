    "question": "The commuting time for a student to travel from home to a college campus is normally distributed with a mean of 30 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. If the student leaves home at 8:25 A.M., what is the probability that the student will arrive at the college campus later than 9 A.M.?",
