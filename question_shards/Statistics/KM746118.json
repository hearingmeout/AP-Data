Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Hurricane damage amounts, in millions of dollars per acre, were estimated from insurance records for major hurricanes for the past three decades. A stratified random sample of five locations (based on categories of distance from the coast) was selected from each of three coastal regions in the southeastern United States. The three regions were Gulf Coast (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi), Florida, and Lower Atlantic (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina). Damage amounts in millions of dollars per acre, adjusted for inflation, are shown in the table below. Sketch a graphical display that compares the hurricane damage amounts per acre for the three different coastal regions (Gulf Coast, Florida, and Lower Atlantic) and that also shows how the damage amounts vary with distance from the coast. Describe differences and similarities in the hurricane damage amounts among the three regions. Because the distributions of hurricane damage amounts are often skewed, statisticians frequently use rank values to analyze such data. In the table below, the hurricane damage amounts have been replaced by the ranks 1, 2, or 3. For each of the distance categories, the highest damage amount is assigned a rank of 1 and the lowest damage amount is assigned a rank of 3. Determine the missing ranks for the 10-to-20-miles distance category and calculate the average rank for each of the three regions. Place the values in the table below. Consider testing the following hypotheses. H0 : There is no difference in the distributions of hurricane damage amounts among the three regions. Ha : There is a difference in the distributions of hurricane damage amounts among the three regions. If there is no difference in the distribution of hurricane damage amounts among the three regions (Gulf Coast, Florida, and Lower Atlantic), the expected value of the average rank for each of the three regions is 2.
