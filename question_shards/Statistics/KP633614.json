    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.A local school board plans to conduct a survey of parents’ opinions about year-round schooling in elementary schools. The school board obtains a list of all families in the district with at least one child in an elementary school and sends the survey to a random sample of 500 of the families. The survey question is provided below.A proposal has been submitted that would require students in elementary schools to attend school on a year-round basis. Do you support this proposal? (Yes or No)The school board received responses from 98 of the families, with 76 of the responses indicating support for year-round schools. Based on this outcome, the local school board concludes that most of the families with at least one child in elementary school prefer year-round schooling.What is a possible consequence of nonresponse bias for interpreting the results of this survey? Someone advised the local school board to take an additional random sample of 500 families and to use the combined results to make their decision. Would this be a suitable solution to the issue raised in part (a)? Explain.Suggest a different follow-up step from the one suggested in part (b) that the local school board could take to address the issue raised in part (a).",
