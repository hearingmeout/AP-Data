    "question": "A certain cell phone plan charges a fee of $1 for each international call made plus $0.02 for each second of talk time for the international call. A business owner tracked the time and cost for each of the calls made by the employees when they traveled internationally for business. What is the appropriate value of the correlation between time and cost for the international calls?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The appropriate value is 1.02 because each call takes at least one second.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The appropriate value is 1 because there is a perfect linear relationship between the time of the call and how much it costs.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The appropriate value is 0.97 because there is a strong positive relationship between the time and cost of a call.",

        "label": "The appropriate value is <math alttext=\"negative 0.50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.50</mn></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> because the phone company should discount the price for business owners who make many international calls.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The appropriate value is 0 because there is no variability in the cost of the calls.",

    ],
    "answer": "The appropriate value is 1 because there is a perfect linear relationship between the time of the call and how much it costs."
