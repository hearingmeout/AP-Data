    "question": "Mr. Ikeler conducted a study investigating the effectiveness of a new method for teaching a mathematics unit. He recruited 80 students at a college and randomly assigned them to two groups. Group 1 was taught with the new method, and group 2 was taught with the traditional method. Both groups were taught by the same teacher. At the end of the unit, an achievement test was administered and used to make a comparison of the two groups. What is the response variable in the study?",
