    "description": "In certain regions of the country, elk can cause damage to agricultural crops by walking through the fields. One strategy designed to limit elk from crossing a field is to surround the field with a fence. Some elk, however, will still be able to bypass the fence. For a period of one month, the number of elk found crossing a sample of fields with a fence was recorded and used to construct the 95 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 2.9 comma 4.4, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2.9</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>4.4</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> for the mean number of elk. Assume that the conditions for inference were checked and verified.",
