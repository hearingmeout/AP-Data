    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. The Earth's Moon has many impact craters that were created when the inner solar system was subjected to heavy bombardment of small celestial bodies. Scientists studied 11 impact craters on the Moon to determine whether there was any relationship between the age of the craters (based on radioactive dating of lunar rocks) and the impact rate (as deduced from the density of the craters). The data are displayed in the scatterplot below. a. Describe the nature of the relationship between impact rate and age. Prior to fitting a linear regression model, the researchers transformed both impact rate and age by using logarithms. The following computer output and residual plot were produced. b. Interpret the value of r2 . c. Comment on the appropriateness of this linear regression for modeling the relationship between the transformed variables.",
