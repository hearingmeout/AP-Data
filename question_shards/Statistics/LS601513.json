    "description": "The scatterplot below displays the relationship between the percent change in the population of wolves and the moose density, in number of moose per square kilometer, over a 19-year period in a certain region. Notice that the association is negative, and that the points seem to be more spread out at higher moose densities.",
    "question": "Suppose the variables on the scatterplot were reversed, so that moose density was the response variable on the vertical axis, and percent change in wolf population was the explanatory variable on the horizontal axis. Which of the following would be true?",
