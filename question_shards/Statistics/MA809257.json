Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A veterinarian is comparing two diets, Diet J and Diet W, designed to help overweight large-breed dogs lose weight. Thirty-two overweight large-breed dogs were randomly assigned to one of the two diets, with <math alttext=\"16\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> dogs in each group. The dogs remained on the assigned diet for six months and the weight loss, in pounds, was recorded for each dog. Summary statistics of the weight loss for the two groups are shown.
