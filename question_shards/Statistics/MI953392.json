    "description": "Daniela designed an experiment to investigate whether listening to music or burning a scented candle affects her performance while playing her favorite video game. Each day for one month, she randomly chose whether to listen to classical, rock, or no music while playing her favorite video game. Each day, she also randomly chose whether to burn a candle with an orange scent, burn a candle with a lavender scent, or not burn a candle. At the end of each day, she recorded the mean score for <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> plays of her favorite video game.",
