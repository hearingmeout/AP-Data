    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.Each full carton of Grade A eggs consists of 1 randomly selected empty cardboard container and 12 randomly selected eggs. The weights of such full cartons are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 840 grams and a standard deviation of 7.9 grams.What is the probability that a randomly selected full carton of Grade A eggs will weigh more than 850 grams?The weights of the empty cardboard containers have a mean of 20 grams and a standard deviation of 1.7 grams. It is reasonable to assume independence between the weights of the empty cardboard containers and the weights of the eggs. It is also reasonable to assume independence among the weights of the 12 eggs that are randomly selected for a full carton.Let the random variable X be the weight of a single randomly selected Grade A egg.What is the mean of X ?What is the standard deviation of X ?",
