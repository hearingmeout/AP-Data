Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. An investment firm that buys and sells stocks is developing a formula that uses data from the stock market to signal when certain stocks should be bought or sold. The firm plans to investigate the performance of two different formulas (J and K) across its large portfolio of stocks. A random sample of <math alttext=\"38\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>38</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> stocks was selected from those in the firm’s portfolio. For one year, both formulas examined the data for each stock and issued signals to either buy the stock when it predicted a price increase or sell the stock when it predicted a price decrease. The difference in formula performance, measured by the difference in the proportion of price increases and decreases correctly predicted, was recorded for each stock at the end of the one year. The histogram shows the distribution of the differences in formula performance (J minus K) for the <math alttext=\"38\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>38</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> stocks.
