    "question": "In a certain region, 10 percent of the homes have solar panels. A city official is investigating energy consumption for homes within the region. Each week, the city official selects a random sample of homes from the region. Let random variable <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of homes selected at random from the region until a home that has solar panels is selected. The random variable <math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mi>Y</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math> has a geometric distribution with a mean of 10. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the mean?",
