    "question": "Past records indicate that 15 percent of the flights for a certain airline are delayed. Suppose flights are randomly selected one at a time from all flights. Assume each selection is independent of another. Which of the following is closest to the probability that it will take 5 selections to find one flight that is delayed?",
