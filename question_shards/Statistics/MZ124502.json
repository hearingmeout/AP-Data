    "description": "Dan selected a random sample of 100 students from the 1,200 at his school to investigate preferences for making up school days lost due to emergency closings. The results are shown in the table below.",
    "question": "Dan incorrectly performed a large sample test of the difference in two proportions using 58/100 and 42/100 and calculated a p-value of 0.02. Consequently, he concluded that there was a significant difference in preference for the two options. Which of the following best describes his error in the analysis of these data?",
