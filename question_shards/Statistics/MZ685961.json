    "question": "A study was conducted to investigate whether a new drug could significantly reduce pain in people with arthritis. From a group of 500 people with arthritis, 250 were randomly assigned to receive the drug (group 1) and the remaining people were assigned a placebo (group 2). After one month of treatment, 225 people in group 1 reported pain relief and 150 people in group 2 reported pain relief.
