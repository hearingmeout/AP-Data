    "question": "An experiment compared the adhesion of 2 types of paint, A and B, to 3 types of metal, 1, 2, and 3, used in automobiles. Thirty sheets of metal were used in the experiment: 10 of Metal 1, 10 of Metal 2, and 10 of Metal 3. Half of each metal type will receive paint A and the other half will receive paint B. The adhesion of the paints was measured, and the measures were compared. How many experimental units are in the experiment?",
