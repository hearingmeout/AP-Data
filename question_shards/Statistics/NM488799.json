    "description": "Jessica wanted to determine if the proportion of males for a certain species of laboratory animal is less than 0.5. She was given access to appropriate records that contained information on 12,000 live births for the species. To construct a 95 percent confidence interval, she selected a simple random sample of 100 births from the records and found that 31 births were male.",
    "question": "Based on the study, which of the following expressions is an approximate 95 percent confidence interval estimate for p, the proportion of males in the 12,000 live births?",
