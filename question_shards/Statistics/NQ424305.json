    "description": "A study was conducted to investigate whether there are regional differences in peanut butter preference in the United States. The country was divided into 7 geographic regions, and in each region a random sample of peanut butter eaters were asked whether they preferred creamy or crunchy peanut butter. The responses were summarized in a 7-by-2 table of counts for each combination of geographic region and creamy or crunchy peanut butter preference.",
    "question": "Which of the following tests is the most appropriate for the investigation?",
