    "question": "A jeweler was interested in the relationship between the weight of a diamond, in carats, and the market price of the diamond, in dollars. The jeweler selected a random sample of diamonds with the same cut and quality and recorded the weight and market price of each diamond. Which of the following residual plots provides evidence that the condition that there is a linear relationship between weight and market price has not been met?",
