    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. At a financial institution, a fraud detection system identifies suspicious transactions and sends them to a specialist for review. The specialist reviews the transaction, the customer profile, and past history. If there is sufficient evidence of fraud, the transaction is blocked. Based on past history, the specialist blocks 40 percent of the suspicious transactions. Assume a suspicious transaction is independent of other suspicious transactions. (a) Suppose the specialist will review 136 suspicious transactions in one day. What is the expected number of blocked transactions by the specialist? Show your work.",
