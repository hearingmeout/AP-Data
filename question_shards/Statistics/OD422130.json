    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. A study was conducted to determine where moose are found in a region containing a large burned area. A map of the study area was partitioned into the following four habitat types. Inside the burned area, not near the edge of the burned area, Inside the burned area, near the edge, Outside the burned area, near the edge, and Outside the burned area, not near the edge. The figure below shows these four habitat types. The proportion of total acreage in each of the habitat types was determined for the study area. Using an aerial survey, moose locations were observed and classified into one of the four habitat types. The results are given in the table below. The researchers who are conducting the study expect the number of moose observed in a habitat type to be proportional to the amount of acreage of that type of habitat. Are the data consistent with this expectation? Conduct an appropriate statistical test to support your conclusion. Assume the conditions for inference are met. Relative to the proportion of total acreage, which habitat types did the moose seem to prefer? Explain.",
