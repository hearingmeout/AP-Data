    "description": "For a certain brand of tomato seeds, the seed package claims that it takes 87 days after planting for the tomato plants to produce fruit. Sarah, a botanist, wanted to know whether the mean number of days for the plants to produce fruit where she lives is different from 87 days. She planted 40 seeds and recorded the number of days for each plant to produce fruit. With all conditions for inference met, the hypothesis test was conducted at the significance level <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, and the test resulted in a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.0752.",
