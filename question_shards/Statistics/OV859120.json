    "description": "An agronomist is an expert in soil management and crop production. A certain state hires an agronomist to investigate whether there is a linear relationship between a wheat stalk’s height and the yield of wheat. The agronomist collected data and used the data to test the claim that there is a linear relationship at a significance level of <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>.
