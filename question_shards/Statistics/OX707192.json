    "question": "The district manager of four different restaurants wanted to investigate whether the four restaurants differed with respect to customers ordering dessert or not based on family classification (with children or without children). Independent random samples of 100 customers who ordered dessert were selected from each restaurant, and the customers were identified as either being with children or without children. After verifying the conditions for the appropriate hypothesis test, the manager calculated a chi-square test statistic of 6.45 with an associated <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.092. Based on the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value and <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, what conclusion should the manager make regarding the proportion of customers who order dessert at each restaurant and the customers’ family classification?",
