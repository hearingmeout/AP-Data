    "question": "A pottery school wants to study whether the glaze of stoneware bowls is affected by the temperature used to harden the bowls. The study will use 3 different types of clay because glaze can affect different clay in different ways. Eight bowls will be made with each clay type for a total of 24 bowls, and 4 different temperatures will be used. What is the best design to use for the study?",
