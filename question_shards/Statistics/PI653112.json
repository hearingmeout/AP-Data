    "question": "A company wanted to determine the health care costs of its employees. A sample of 25 employees were interviewed and their medical expenses for the previous year were determined. Later the company discovered that the highest medical expense in the sample was mistakenly recorded as 10 times the actual amount. However, after correcting the error, the corrected amount was still greater than or equal to any other medical expense in the sample. Which of the following sample statistics must have remained the same after the correction was made?",
