    "question": "Based on the results of the simulation, is there convincing statistical evidence at the significance level of 0.05 that the event of Audrey selling at least 7 of the 30 selected tickets is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the distribution of the trials in the simulation is skewed to the right.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the number in the histogram with the greatest frequency is 4, not 7.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because 7 appears in the right tail of the distribution, indicating that it is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the simulation suggests that it is likely that Audrey could sell anywhere from 0 to 11 of the selected tickets.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the simulation suggests that Audrey selling at least 7 of 30 selected tickets would occur about 13.8% of the time.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because the simulation suggests that Audrey selling at least 7 of 30 selected tickets would occur about 13.8% of the time."
