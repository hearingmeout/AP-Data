    "question": "Eighteen individuals who use a particular form of social media were assigned a new user interface to use when logging in to their accounts. After using the new user interface for a week, each individual was asked to rate how easy or hard the new user interface was to use on a scale from 1 (extremely easy) to 9 (extremely hard). Which of the following correctly identifies why this is not a well-designed experiment?",
