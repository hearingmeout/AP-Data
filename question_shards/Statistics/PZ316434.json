    "question": "Market researchers wanted to know whether the placement of a new product on a supermarket shelf significantly increases the percent of shoppers who will buy the product. At Supermarket X, a new product was placed on the top shelf, and at Supermarket Y, the product was placed one shelf below the top shelf. To observe buying habits, the researchers selected a random sample of 364 shoppers at X and another random sample of 327 shoppers at Y. Of the selected shoppers at X, 15 bought the product, and of the selected shoppers at Y, 19 bought the product. Which of the following is the most appropriate method for analyzing the results?",
