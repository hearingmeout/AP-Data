    "question": "A reporter intends to survey residents of a city to investigate whether there are differences in use of grocery delivery services by region of the city where the residents live (north, south, west, and east). City residents will be asked to respond yes or no to the question “Do you regularly use a grocery delivery service to purchase groceries?” Results will be collected in a 4-by-2 table of counts organized by region and response to the question. For a chi-square test for homogeneity, which of the conditions listed below is not necessary to investigate whether there are differences between use of grocery delivery service by region?",
