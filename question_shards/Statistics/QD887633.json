    "description": "An investigator was studying a territorial species of Central American termites, Nasutitermes corniger. Forty-nine termite pairs were randomly selected; both members of each of these pairs were from the same colony. Fifty-five additional termite pairs were randomly selected; the two members in each of these pairs were from different colonies. The pairs were placed in petri dishes and observed to see whether they exhibited aggressive behavior. The results are shown in the table below.",
    "question": "A Chi-square test for homogeneity was conducted, resulting in x2 = 7.638. The expected counts are shown in parentheses in the table. Which of the following sets of statements follows from these results?",
