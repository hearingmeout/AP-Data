    "description": "Raoul performed an experiment using 16 windup rubber band single-propeller airplanes. He wound up the propeller a different number of times and recorded the amount of time (in seconds) that the airplane flew for each number of rotations that the propeller was wound. A regression analysis was performed and the partial computer output is given below.",
    "question": "Which of the following is a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of the regression line that relates the number of rotations the rubber band is wound and the plane's flight time?",
