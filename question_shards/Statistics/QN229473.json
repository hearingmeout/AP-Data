    "question": "A simulation was conducted using 10 fair six-sided dice, where the faces were numbered 1 through 6, respectively. All 10 dice were rolled, and the average of the 10 numbers appearing faceup was recorded. The process was repeated 20 times. Which of the following best describes the distribution being simulated?",
