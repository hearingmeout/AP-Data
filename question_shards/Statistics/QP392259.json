Use the graph in part (a) to write a few sentences describing the distribution of caffeine content for the twelve beverages. A 12-ounce cup of one popular gourmet coffee contains over 300 milligrams of caffeine. If this value was added to the data set of twelve numbers above, how would the mean and median of the data set above compare with the mean and median of the new data set with the thirteen numbers? Explain how this comparison could be made without performing any",
