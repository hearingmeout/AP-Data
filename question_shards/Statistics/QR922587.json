    "question": "A school librarian wanted to estimate the proportion of students in the school who had read a certain book. The librarian sampled 50 students from the senior English classes, and 35 of the students in the sample had read the book. Have the conditions for creating a confidence interval for the population proportion been met?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the sample was selected at random.",

        "label": "Yes, because sampling distributions of proportions are modeled with the normal model.",

      {
