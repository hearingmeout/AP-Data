    "question": "To estimate the average cost of flowers for summer weddings in a certain region, a journalist selected a random sample of 15 summer weddings that were held in the state. A graph of the sample data showed an approximately symmetric distribution with no outliers. The sample mean and standard deviation were $734 and $102, respectively. The journalist will create a 95 percent confidence interval to estimate the population mean. Have all conditions for inference been met?",
