    "question": "A graduate student conducted a study of field mice in rural Kansas. The student obtained a sample of 100 field mice and recorded the weight, in grams, of each mouse. After the measurements were taken, it was discovered that the scale was not calibrated correctly. The student adjusted the 100 recorded measurements by subtracting 3 grams from each measurement. Which of the following statistics for the weight, in grams, of the field mice has the same value before and after the adjustment?",
