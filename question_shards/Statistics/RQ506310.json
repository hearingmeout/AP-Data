    "description": "Alicia would like to know if there is a difference in the average price between two brands of shoes. She selected and analyzed a random sample of 40 different types of Brand A shoes and 33 different types of Brand B shoes. Alicia observes that the boxplot of the sample of Brand A shoe prices shows two outliers. Alicia wants to construct a confidence interval to estimate the difference in population means.",
    "question": "Is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means approximately normal?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because Alicia selected a random sample.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because for each brand it is reasonable to assume that the population size is greater than ten times its sample size.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the size of each sample is at least 30.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the distribution of Brand A shoes has outliers.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the shape of the population distribution is unknown.",

    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because the size of each sample is at least 30."
