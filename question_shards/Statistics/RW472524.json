    "question": "Students are designing an experiment to compare the productivity of two varieties of dwarf fruit trees. The site for the experiment is a field that is bordered by a densely forested area on the west (left) side. The field has been divided into eight plots of approximately the same area. The students have decided that the test plots should be blocked. Four trees, two of each of the two varieties, will be assigned at random to the four plots within each block, with one tree planted in each plot.The two blocking schemes shown below are under consideration.For each scheme, one block is indicated by the white region and the other block is indicated by the gray region in the figures.Which of the blocking schemes, A or B, is better for this experiment? Explain your answer.Even though the students have decided to block, they must randomly assign the varieties of trees to the plots within each block. What is the purpose of this randomization in the context of this experiment?",
