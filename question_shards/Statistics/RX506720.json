For each child, the researchers recorded the child’s screen time, in hours per day, when they were <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> years old (<math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mi>x</mi> </math>) and their scores on a developmental test, in points, when they were <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> years old (<math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>y</mi></math>). Higher scores on the developmental test are better. The <math alttext=\"95\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>95</mn></math> percent confidence interval for the slope of the least-squares regression line for predicting scores on the developmental test based on screen time was <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, negative 0.13 comma negative 0.02, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.13</mn><mo>,</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.02</mn></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
