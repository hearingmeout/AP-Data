    "question": "A researcher conducted an experiment to investigate the effectiveness of a medicated lotion in treating a skin irritation. A group of 80 people with a history of skin irritation volunteered for the study. Of the 80 people, 40 were randomly assigned the medicated lotion, and the remaining 40 were given a nonmedicated lotion. At the end of one month, the skin irritation had cleared for 36 people (90 percent) using the medicated lotion and 16 people (40 percent) using the nonmedicated lotion. Analysis of the results showed the difference was statistically significant. What can be concluded from the experiment?",
