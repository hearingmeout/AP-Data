    "question": "Approximately 3.5 percent of all children born in a certain region are from multiple births (that is, twins, triplets, etc.). Of the children born in the region who are from multiple births, 22 percent are left-handed. Of the children born in the region who are from single births, 11 percent are left-handed. What is the probability that a randomly selected child born in the region is left-handed? What is the probability that a randomly selected child born in the region is a child from a multiple birth, given that the child selected is left-handed? A random sample of 20 children born in the region will be selected. What is the probability that the sample will have at least 3 children who are left-handed?",
