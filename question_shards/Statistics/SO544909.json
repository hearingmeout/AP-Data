    "question": "A large company is considering opening a franchise in St. Louis and wants to estimate the mean household income for the area using a simple random sample of households. Based on information from a pilot study, the company assumes that the standard deviation of household incomes is σ = $7,200. Of the following, which is the least number of households that should be surveyed to obtain an estimate that is within $200 of the true mean household income with 95 percent confidence?",
