    "description": "A scientist is interested in whether there is a linear relationship between the amount of mercury in a lake and the surface area of the lake. The scientist collected data on 22 lakes of a similar type selected at random and used the data to test the claim that there is a linear relationship. The following hypotheses were used to test the claim.",
