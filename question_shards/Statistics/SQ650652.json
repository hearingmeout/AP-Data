    "question": "For a specific species of fish in a pond, a wildlife biologist wants to build a regression equation to predict the weight of a fish based on its length. The biologist collects a random sample of this species of fish and finds that the lengths vary from 0.75 to 1.35 inches. The biologist uses the data from the sample to create a single linear regression model. Would it be appropriate to use this model to predict the weight of a fish of this species that is 3 inches long?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the regression equation is based on a random sample.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the association between length and weight is positive.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because there may not be any 3-inch fish of this species in the pond.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "No, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample."
