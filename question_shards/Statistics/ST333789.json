Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A certain type of bird lives in two regions of a state. The distribution of weight for birds of this type in the northern region is approximately normal with mean 10 ounces and standard deviation 3 ounces. The distribution of weight for birds of this type in the southern region is approximately normal with mean 16 ounces and standard deviation 2.5 ounces. (a) Calculate the <math alttext=\"z\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-scores for a weight of 13 ounces for a bird living in the northern region and for a weight of 13 ounces for a bird living in the southern region.",
