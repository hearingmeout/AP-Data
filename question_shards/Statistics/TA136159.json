    "question": "A soda manufacturer claims that its Cherry Fizz soda has more carbonation than a competitor’s Cherry Eclipse soda. Bottles of both types of soda are opened, covered with a balloon, and then shaken. The diameter of each balloon is then measured. The mean balloon diameters are 2.3 inches for the Cherry Fizz soda and 2.1 inches for the Cherry Eclipse soda. A 90 percent confidence interval to estimate the difference in mean diameters, in inches, is <math alttext=\"negative 0.8 comma 1.2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.8</mn></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>1.2</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>. Which of the following claims is supported by the interval?",

      {

        "label": "Because 2.3 and 2.1 are very similar, there is no difference in the mean carbonation levels.",
