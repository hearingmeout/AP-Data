    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.For many years, the medically accepted practice of giving aid to a person experiencing a heart attack was to have the person who placed the emergency call administer chest compression (CC) plus standard mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (MMR) to the heart attack patient until the emergency response team arrived. However, some researchers believed that CC alone would be a more effective approach.In the 1990s a study was conducted in Seattle in which 518 cases were randomly assigned to treatments: 278 to CC plus standard MMR and 240 to CC alone. A total of 64 patients survived the heart attack: 29 in the group receiving CC plus standard MMR, and 35 in the group receiving CC alone. A test of significance was conducted on the following hypotheses.H0: The survival rates for the two treatments are equal.Ha: The treatment that uses CC alone produces a higher survival rate.This test resulted in a p-value of 0.0761.Interpret what this p-value measures in the context of this study.Based on this p-value and study design, what conclusion should be drawn in the context of this study? Use a significance level of α = 0.05.Based on your conclusion in part (b), which type of error, Type I or Type II, could have been made? What is one potential consequence of this error?",
