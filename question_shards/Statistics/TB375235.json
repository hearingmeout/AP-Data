    "question": "A machine is designed to dispense at least 12 ounces of a beverage into a bottle. To test whether the machine is working properly, a random sample of 50 bottles was selected and the mean number of ounces for the 50 bottles was computed. A test of the hypotheses H0 : µ = 12 versus Ha : µ < 12 was conducted, where µ represents the population mean number of ounces of the beverage dispensed per bottle by the machine. The p-value for the test was 0.08. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion to draw at the significance level of α = 0.05?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Because the p-value is greater than the significance level, there is convincing evidence that the population mean number of ounces dispensed into a bottle is 12 ounces.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Because the p-value is greater than the significance level, there is convincing evidence that the population mean number of ounces dispensed into a bottle is less than 12 ounces.",
