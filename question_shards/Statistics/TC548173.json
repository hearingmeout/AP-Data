    "description": "A fair die has its faces numbered from 1 to 6. Let random variable <math alttext=\"F\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number landing face up when the die is tossed. The probability distribution for the random variable has mean 3.5 and standard deviation 1.7078. Consider a simulation with 400 trials designed to estimate the sampling distribution of the sample mean for 5 tosses of the die. For each trial, the die is tossed 5 times, and the mean of the 5 values landing face up is recorded.",
