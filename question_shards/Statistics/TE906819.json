    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.Some boxes of a certain brand of breakfast cereal include a voucher for a free video rental inside the box. The company that makes the cereal claims that a voucher can be found in 20 percent of the boxes. However, based on their experiences eating this cereal at home, a group of students believes that the proportion of boxes with vouchers is less than 0.2. This group of students purchased 65 boxes of the cereal to investigate the company’s claim. The students found a total of 11 vouchers for free video rentals in the 65 boxes.Suppose it is reasonable to assume that the 65 boxes purchased by the students are a random sample of all boxes of this cereal. Based on this sample, is there support for the students’ belief that the proportion of boxes with vouchers is less than 0.2 ? Provide statistical evidence to support your answer.",
