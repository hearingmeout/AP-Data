Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Chronic dry eye is a common eye disorder. An eye doctor plans to investigate the following claim by a manufacturer of eye drops. Our new eye drop formula is more effective than our competitor’s eye drop formula in providing relief from chronic dry eye. The doctor is considering the following two options for the design of a study: Design A Design B Obtain <math alttext=\"300\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>300</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers from the population of people who have chronic dry eye and use the new eye drop formula each day.
