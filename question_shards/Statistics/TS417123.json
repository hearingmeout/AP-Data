    "question": "A local real estate magazine used the median instead of the mean when it reported the SAT score of the average student who attends Groveland High School. A graphical display of SAT scores of students who attend Groveland High School indicated that the data were strongly skewed to the right. Which of the following explains why, in this situation, the median is a more accurate indicator of the SAT score of the average student than the mean is?",
