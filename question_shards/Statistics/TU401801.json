    "description": "A magazine article reported that college students spend an average of $100 on a first date. A university sociologist believed that number was too high for the students at the university. The sociologist surveyed 32 randomly selected students from the university and obtained a sample mean of $92.23 for the most recent first dates. A one-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test resulted in a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.026.",
