    "description": "Researchers studying the relationship between sleep and memory obtained a sample of <math alttext=\"28\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>28</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> adults to participate in an experiment. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to a full night’s sleep, and the other half were awakened every two hours throughout the night. The following day, the participants were given a list of words to memorize and recall after one hour. Researchers recorded the number of words recalled by each participant. The <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of an appropriate statistical test was <math alttext=\"0.29\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0.29</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>.",
