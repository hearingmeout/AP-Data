    "description": "The distribution of long jump distance in a statewide high school league is approximately normal with a mean of <math alttext=\"18.5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>18.5</mn></math> feet and a standard deviation of <math alttext=\"3.2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3.2</mn></math> feet. Two students, Joshua and Mateo, from this league competed in the long jump. Joshua’s distance was <math alttext=\"0.52\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.52</mn></math> standard deviation below the mean of the distribution.
