    "question": "A group of students wanted to investigate the claim that the average number of text messages sent yesterday by students in their school was greater than 100. They asked each student in a random sample of 50 students how many text messages he or she sent yesterday. An appropriate t-test was conducted and resulted in a p-value of 0.0853. Assuming the conditions for the t-test were met, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?",

      {
        "label": "Because p > 0.10, at the 10% significance level, it can be concluded that the mean number of text messages sent yesterday by students in the school is less than 100.",
