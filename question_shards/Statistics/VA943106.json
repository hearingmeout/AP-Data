    "description": "A researcher was interested in the relationship between the number of texts sent in a day and the number of e-mails sent in a day by employees at a certain company. Using 15 data values, a 90 percent confidence interval for the slope of a regression model was found to be <math alttext=\"2.31 comma 3.47\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2.31</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>3.47</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>. The researcher claims that the interval would have been narrower with a different sample size if all other things remained the same.",
    "question": "Which of the following sample sizes would make the researcher’s claim NOT true?",
