    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. The director of a bird exhibit at a local zoo conducted a study to investigate whether warmer exhibit temperatures increase the frequency of mating calls for finches (songbirds) during mating season. The director randomly selected <math alttext=\"32\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>32</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> finches from the exhibit. The frequency of the mating calls, measured by counting the number of mating calls per minute, at the current exhibit temperature and again at a warmer temperature a day later were recorded for each of the <math alttext=\"32\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>32</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> finches. All other variables were held constant between the two days. The dotplot shows the difference in the frequency of mating calls (current temperature minus warmer temperature). (a) Explain what a positive difference indicates in the context of the study.",
