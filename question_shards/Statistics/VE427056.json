    "question": "Meteorologists are interested in the relationship between minimum pressure and maximum wind speed of hurricanes. The minimum pressure, in millibars, and maximum wind speed, in knots, were collected for a random sample of 100 hurricanes from the year 1995 to the year 2012. A regression analysis of maximum wind speed on minimum wind pressure produced a 95 percent confidence interval of (-1.42, -1.20) for the slope of the least-squares regression line. Which statement is a correct interpretation of the interval?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The probability is 0.95 that wind speed will decrease, on average, between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pressure.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The probability is 0.95 that a different sample of 100 hurricanes will result in an increase, on average, of wind speed between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pressure.",
