    "question": "A researcher conducted a study investigating the effect of computer screen time on a person’s amount of <math alttext=\"R E M\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>REM</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> sleep. The researcher randomly assigned 100 people into four groups. The first group was given 2 hours of computer screen time each day, the second group was given 4 hours each day, the third group was given 6 hours each day, and the fourth group was given 8 hours each day. The study was conducted for one week, and the amount of <math alttext=\"R E M\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>REM</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> sleep for each person was measured. What is the explanatory variable in the study?",
