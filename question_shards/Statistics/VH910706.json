    "question": "In a study to determine whether miles driven is a good predictor of trade-in value, 11 cars of the same age, make, model, and condition were randomly selected. The following scatterplot shows trade-in value and mileage for those cars. Five of the points are labeled A, B, C, D, and E, respectively.\n\nWhich of the five labeled points is the most influential with respect to a regression of trade-in value versus miles driven?",
