    "question": "A family would like to build a linear regression equation to predict the amount of grain harvested per acre of land on their farm. They subdivide their land into several smaller plots of land for testing and would like to select an explanatory variable they can control. Which of the following is an appropriate explanatory variable that the family could use to create a linear regression equation?",
