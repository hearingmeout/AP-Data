    "question": "A marketing consultant, Sofia, has been studying the effect of increasing advertising spending on product sales. Sofia conducts several experiments, each time spending less than $1,000 in advertising. When she analyzed the relationship between <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> <math alttext=\"equals\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>=</mo></mrow></mstyle></math> advertising spending and <math alttext=\"y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math><math alttext=\"equals\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>=</mo></mrow></mstyle></math> product sales, the relationship was linear with <math alttext=\"r equals 0.90\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.90</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. Her boss is thrilled and asks her to estimate product sales for $100,000 in advertising spending. Is it appropriate for her to calculate a predicted amount of product sales with advertising spending of $100,000 ?",
