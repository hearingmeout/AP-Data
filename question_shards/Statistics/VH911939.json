    "question": "An engineer believes that there is a linear relationship between the thickness of an air filter and the amount of particulate matter that gets through the filter; that is, less pollution should get through thicker filters. The engineer tests many filters of different thickness and fits a linear model. If a linear model is appropriate, what should be apparent in the residual plot?",
