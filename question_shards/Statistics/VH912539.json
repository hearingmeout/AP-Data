    "question": "A restaurant manager collected data on the number of customers in a party in the restaurant and the time elapsed until the party left the restaurant. The manager computed a correlation of 0.78 between the two variables. What information does the correlation provide about the relationship between the number of customers in a party at the restaurant and the time elapsed until the party left the restaurant?",
