    "question": "Thirty-six students at a local middle school were randomly selected to participate in a taste test to select a new menu item for a cafeteria. Each student was given a choice between the macaroni and cheese and the Cajun potato barrels. From the sample, 20 students selected macaroni and cheese and 16 students chose the Cajun potato barrels. Each student was asked to rate the item they chose on a scale from 1 (extremely dislike) to 9 (extremely like). Which of the following prevents this study from being a well-designed experiment?",
