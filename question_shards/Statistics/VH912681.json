    "question": "A tennis ball was thrown in the air. The height of the ball from the ground was recorded every millisecond from the time the ball was thrown until it reached the height from which it was thrown. The correlation between the time and height was computed to be 0. What does this correlation suggest about the relationship between the time and height?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "There is no relationship between time and height.",
