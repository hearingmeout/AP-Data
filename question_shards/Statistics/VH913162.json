    "question": "Clear-cut harvesting of wood from forests creates long periods of time when certain animals cannot use the forests as habitats. Partial-cut harvesting is increasingly used to lessen the effects of logging on the animals. The following scatterplot shows the relationship between the density of red squirrels, in squirrels per plot, 2 to 4 years after partial-cut harvesting, and the percent of trees that were harvested in each of 11 forests.\n\nWhich of the following is the best description of the relationship displayed in the scatterplot?",
