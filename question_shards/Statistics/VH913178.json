    "description": "A study was conducted on three types of home siding and the type of damage done to the siding by woodpeckers. Each hole made by a woodpecker was classified as either drumming (territorial signaling), foresting (looking for food), or nesting. The following bar chart shows the relative frequency of the holes for each type of siding.",
    "question": "Which of the following statements is supported by the bar chart?",
