    "question": "A recent study investigated whether renowned violinists were able to classify the age of a violin. In the study, violins constructed before 1900 and violins constructed after 2010 were used. The violinists played each violin and were asked to classify the violin as old (constructed before 1900) or new (constructed after 2010). The responses are shown in the following table.\nViolin Correctly Classified Incorrectly Classified Total New (constructed after 2010) 15 18 33 Old (constructed before 1900) 18 13 31 Total 33 31 64 \nWhich of the following statements is supported by the results in the table?",
