    "question": "A penalty kick in soccer involves two players from different teams, the shooter and the goalie. During the penalty kick the shooter will try to score a goal by kicking a soccer ball to the left or right of the goal area. To prevent the shooter from scoring a goal, the goalie will move to the left or right of the goal area. The following table summarizes the directions taken by the shooter and the goalie for 372 penalty kicks.\n\nShooter\n\nKick Left \n\nKick Right \n\nTotal \n\nGoalie \n\nMove Left \n80 \n132\n212 \n\nMove Right \n85 \n75\n160 \n\nTotal \n165 \n207 \n372 \n\nWhich of the following indicates an association between the shooter's choice of direction and the goalie’s choice of direction?",
