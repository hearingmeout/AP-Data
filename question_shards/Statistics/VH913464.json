    "question": "Researchers observed the grouping behavior of deer in different regions. The following scatterplot shows data collected on the size of the group and the percent of the region that was woodland.\n\nThe relationship between group size and percent woodland appears to be negative and nonlinear. Which of the following statements explains such a relationship?",
