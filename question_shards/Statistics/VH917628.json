    "description": "A thumbtack that is tossed can land point up or point down. The probability of a tack landing point up is 0.2. A simulation was conducted in which a trial consisted of tossing 5 thumbtacks and recording the number of thumbtacks that land point up. Many trials of the simulation were conducted and the results are shown in the histogram.",
    "question": "Based on the results of the simulation, which of the following is closest to the probability that at least 2 thumbtacks land pointing up when 5 thumbtacks are tossed?",
