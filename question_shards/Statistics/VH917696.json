    "question": "Data were collected on the number of days per week that members visit a certain fitness center. The values varied from 0 to 7, and a distribution of relative frequencies for the values was created. Let the random variable <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of days per week that a member visits. The mean of <math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow></math> is 3.12. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the mean?",
