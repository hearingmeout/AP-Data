    "question": "A company that ships crystal bowls claims that bowls arrive undamaged in 95 percent of the shipments. Let the random variable <math alttext=\"G\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of shipments with undamaged bowls in 25 randomly selected shipments. Random variable <math alttext=\"G\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> follows a binomial distribution with a mean of 23.75 shipments and a standard deviation of approximately 1.09 shipments. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the mean?",
