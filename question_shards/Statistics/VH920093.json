    "question": "In a certain region, 94 percent of the people have a certain characteristic in their blood. Suppose a group of 45 people from the region are selected at random. Let the random variable <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of people in the sample without the characteristic. Random variable <math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> follows a binomial distribution with a mean of 2.7 people. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the mean?",
