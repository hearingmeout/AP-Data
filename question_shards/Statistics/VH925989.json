A random sample of <math alttext=\"n\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> employees will be selected and their commute times will be recorded.\nWhat is true about the sampling distribution of the sample mean as <math alttext=\"n\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> increases from 2 to 10 ?",
