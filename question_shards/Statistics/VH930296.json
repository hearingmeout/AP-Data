    "question": "A recent report indicated that 22 percent of the households in a certain community speak a language other than English at home. A reporter will randomly select a household from the community until the first household that speaks a language other than English at home is selected. Let random variable <math alttext=\"Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> represent the number of attempts needed until the first household that speaks a language other than English at home is selected. The random variable <math alttext=\"Q\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> has a geometric distribution with <math alttext=\"p equals 0.22\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.22</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. Which of the following is closest to the variance of the random variable?",
