    "description": "An online customer service department estimates that about 15 percent of callers have to wait more than 8 minutes to have their calls answered by a person. The department conducted a simulation of 1,000 trials to estimate the probabilities that a certain number of callers out of the next 10 callers will have to wait more than 8 minutes to have their calls answered. The simulation is shown in the following histogram.",
    "question": "Based on the simulation, what is the probability that at most 2 of the next 10 callers will have to wait more than 8 minutes to have their calls answered?",
