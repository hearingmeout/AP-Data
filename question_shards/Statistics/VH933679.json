    "question": "A researcher randomly selected 30 people to participate in a study to investigate which of two materials, A or B, used in the heels of sneakers will last longer. The researcher is considering two design types for the study.\n\nDesign 1: Randomly assign 15 participants to wear sneakers with material A on their left feet and material B on their right feet. The remaining participants will wear sneakers with material B on their left feet and material A on their right feet.\n\nDesign 2: Randomly assign 15 participants to wear sneakers with material A on both feet and the remaining participants to wear sneakers with material B on both feet.\n\nWhich of the following best describes each design?",
