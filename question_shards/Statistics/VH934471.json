    "question": "Researchers are investigating the effect of <math alttext=\"p H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> level in water on the breeding habits of the moon jellyfish. As part of a laboratory experiment, they will randomly assign one of three treatments, low <math alttext=\"p H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, medium <math alttext=\"p H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, or high <math alttext=\"p H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>, to the water in the tanks that hold the jellyfish.\nWhich of the following is the best reason for the random assignment of a treatment level to an experimental unit?",
