    "question": "A survey of 100 randomly selected dentists in the state of Ohio results in 78% who would recommend the use of a certain toothpaste. The population proportion is known to be <math alttext=\"p equals 0.72\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.72</mn></mrow></math>. For samples of size 100, which of the following best interprets the mean of the sampling distribution of sample proportion of dentists in the state of Ohio who would recommend the use of a certain toothpaste?",
