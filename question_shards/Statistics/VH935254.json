    "question": "A national charity contacted 100 randomly selected people by phone, and 7 percent of those contacted made a donation to the charity. The population proportion of those who make a donation when contacted by phone is known to be <math alttext=\"p equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>. For samples of size 100, which of the following best interprets the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion of people who make a donation when contacted by phone?",
