    "question": "A recent report indicated that 90 percent of adults in a certain region actively try to include vegetables in their diet. A simulation was conducted that consisted of 50 trials with a population parameter of 0.9. Each trial consisted of a sample size of 10. The number of successes out of 10 was recorded, where success represented an adult trying to include vegetables in the diet.\nFive possible simulation results are shown. Which simulation is the best match to the one described?",
