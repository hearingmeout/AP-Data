    "question": "Researchers are studying two populations of wild horses living in the western regions of a country. In a random sample of 32 horses taken from the first population, the mean age of the sample was 21 years. In a random sample of 41 horses from the second population, the mean age of the sample was 19 years.\nIs the sampling distribution of the difference in sample mean ages approximately normal?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the two populations of wild horses can be modeled by a normal distribution.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the samples were selected at random.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Yes, because the sample sizes are both greater than 30.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the populations are not normal.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the difference in sample mean ages was not 0.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, because the sample sizes are both greater than 30."
