    "question": "In a recent survey, the proportion of adults who indicated mystery as their favorite type of book was 0.325. Two simulations will be conducted for the sampling distribution of a sample proportion from a population with a true proportion of 0.325. Simulation A will consist of 1,500 trials with a sample size of 100. Simulation B will consist of 2,000 trials with a sample size of 50.\nWhich of the following describes the center and variability of simulation A and simulation B?",

    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The centers will roughly be equal, and the variabilities will roughly be equal.",

      },
      {
        "label": "The centers will roughly be equal, and the variability of simulation A will be greater than the variability of simulation B.",
