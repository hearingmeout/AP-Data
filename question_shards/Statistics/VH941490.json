    "question": "A sports magazine reports that the mean number of hot dogs sold by hot dog vendors at a certain sporting event is equal to 150. A random sample of 50 hot dog vendors was selected, and the mean number of hot dogs sold by the vendors at the sporting event was 140.\nFor samples of size 50, which of the following is true about the sampling distribution of the sample mean number of hot dogs sold by hot dog vendors at the sporting event?",
