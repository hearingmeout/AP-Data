    "question": "In one city, 75 percent of residents report that they regularly recycle. In a second city, 90 percent of residents report that they regularly recycle. Simple random samples of 75 residents are selected from each city. Which of the following statements is correct about the approximate normality of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions of residents who report that they regularly recycle?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The sampling distribution is approximately normal because both sample sizes are large enough.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The sampling distribution is not approximately normal because although the sample size for the first city is large enough, the sample size for the second city is not large enough.",
        "image": null

        "label": "The sampling distribution is not approximately normal because although the sample size for the second city is large enough, the sample size for the first city is not large enough.",

      {
        "label": "The sampling distribution is not approximately normal because neither sample size is large enough.",
