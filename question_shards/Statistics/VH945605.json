    "question": "An online news source reports that the proportion of smartphone owners who use a certain operating system is 0.216. Two simulations will be conducted to create a sampling distribution of the sample proportion from a population with proportion 0.216. Simulation A will consist of 1,000 trials with a sample size of 50. Simulation B will consist of 500 trials with a sample size of 100.\nWhich of the following describes the centers and variabilities that should be apparent in the distributions generated by simulation A and simulation B?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "The centers will be approximately equal, and the variabilities will roughly be equal.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "The centers will be approximately equal, and the variability of simulation A will be greater than the variability of simulation B.",
