    "question": "A marketing representative wants to estimate the proportion of people in a state who like the new design on the packaging of a certain cleaning product. The representative interviewed 100 people at a certain supermarket, and 82 people indicated that they liked the new design. Have the conditions for creating a confidence interval for the population proportion been met?",
