    "description": "Independent random samples of students were taken from two high schools, R and S, and the proportion of students who drive to school in each sample was recorded. The difference between the two sample proportions (R minus S) was 0.07. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted where the alternative hypothesis was the population proportion of students who drive to school for R was greater than that for S. The <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test was 0.114.",
