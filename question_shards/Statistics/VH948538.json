    "description": "Medical researchers are studying a certain genetic trait found in two populations of people, W and X. From an independent random sample of people taken from each population, the difference between the sample proportions of people who carried the trait (W minus X) was 0.22. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted using the following hypotheses.",
