    "description": "A factory manager selected a random sample of parts produced on an old assembly line and a random sample of parts produced on a new assembly line. The difference between the sample proportion of defective parts made on the old assembly line and the sample proportion of defective parts made on the new assembly line (old minus new) was 0.006. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis being the proportion of defective parts made on the old assembly line is greater than that of the new assembly line. The <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test was 0.018.",
