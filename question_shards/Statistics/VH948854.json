    "question": "Independent random samples of voters from two voting districts, G and H, were selected to investigate the proportion of all voters who favor a proposal to widen a road that runs through both districts. The difference between the sample proportions (G minus H) was used to create the 95 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"0.13 comma 0.47\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0.13</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>⁢</mo><mn>0.47</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math> for the population difference between districts.\nWhich of the following is the best interpretation of the interval?",
