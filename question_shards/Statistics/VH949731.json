The sample proportion of those who think climate change is a problem was calculated, and a 95 percent confidence interval was constructed as <math alttext=\"0.146 comma 0.214\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0.146</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>⁢</mo><mn>0.214</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>.\nWhich of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?",
