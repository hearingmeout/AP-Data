    "question": "A recent national survey indicated that 73 percent of respondents try to include locally grown foods in their diets. A 95 percent confidence interval for the proportion of all people in the country who try to include locally grown foods in their diets is given as <math alttext=\"0.70 comma 0.76\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0.70</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0.76</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.\nAssume all conditions for inference were met. Based on the confidence interval, which of the following claims is supported?",
