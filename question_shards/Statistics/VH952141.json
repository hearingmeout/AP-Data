    "question": "A fitness center piloted two new programs to help people reduce stress levels and maintain a healthy lifestyle. After one month, 112 of the 125 people who volunteered for a program in mindfulness reported a reduction in stress levels, and 110 of the 135 people who volunteered for a yoga program reported a reduction in stress levels. The fitness center wants to investigate whether there is a significant difference between the proportions of all people in the two programs who would report reductions in stress levels. Have the conditions for inference been met?",
