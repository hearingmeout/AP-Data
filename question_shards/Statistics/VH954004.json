    "question": "A two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for a difference in means was conducted to investigate whether defensive players on a football team can bench-press more weight, on average, than offensive players. The conditions for inference were met, and the test produced a test statistic of <math alttext=\"t equals 1.083\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1.083</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> and a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.15.\nBased on the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value and a significance level of <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, which of the following is the correct conclusion?",
