    "question": "A social scientist believed that less than 30 percent of adults in the United States watch 15 or fewer hours of television per week. To test the belief, the scientist randomly selected 1,250 adults in the United States. The sample proportion of adults who watch 15 or fewer hours of television per week was 0.28, and the resulting hypothesis test had a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.061. The computation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value assumes which of the following is true?",
