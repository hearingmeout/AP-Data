    "question": "Chicken hatcheries employ workers to determine the sex of the baby chicks. The hatcheries claim that the workers are correct 95 percent of the time. An investigator believes the workers’ success rate (workers are correct) is actually less than 95 percent of the time. The investigator selects a random sample of chicks and finds that the hatchery workers had a success rate of 0.936. The conditions for inference were checked and verified, and the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test was given as 0.0322. If the null hypothesis is true, which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value?",
