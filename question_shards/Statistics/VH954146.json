    "question": "A significance test is conducted for which the alternative hypothesis states that more than 83 percent of all adult sea turtles on a certain beach are female. A random sample of adult sea turtles from the beach found that 85 percent of the sea turtles were female. The <math alttext=\"p\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value for the test is 0.4058.
