    "question": "A wildlife biologist is doing research on chronic wasting disease and its impact on the deer populations in northern Colorado. To estimate the difference between the proportions of deer with chronic wasting disease in two different regions, a random sample of 200 deer was obtained from one region and a random sample of 197 deer was obtained from the other region. The biologist checked for the following.\n<math alttext=\"Line 1: 200 times 0.06 is greater than or equal to 10. Line 2: 200 times 0.94 is greater than or equal to 10. Line 3: 197 times 0.086 is greater than or equal to 10. Line 4: 197 times 0.914 is greater than or equal to 10\" display=\"block\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mo>(</mo><mn>200</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>0.06</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>10</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtable><mtr><mtd><mo>(</mo><mn>200</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>0.94</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>10</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtable><mtr><mtd><mo>(</mo><mn>197</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>0.086</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>10</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mo>(</mo><mn>197</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>0.914</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>10</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></mtd></mtr></mtable></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mstyle></math>\n\nWhich of the following conditions for inference was the biologist checking?",
