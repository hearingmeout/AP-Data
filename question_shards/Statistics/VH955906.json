    "description": "An experiment was designed to investigate the relationship between the dosage of a certain migraine medication and the amount of time until relief from the headache was experienced.

The <math alttext=\"20\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> participants in the experiment were known to experience migraines. Each participant was randomly assigned one of the four dosages. When the participants experienced a migraine, they took the assigned medication and recorded the number of minutes it took to experience relief from the headache. The mean number of minutes it took each group to experience relief was compared.",
