    "question": "A random sample of monarch butterflies and a random sample of swallowtail butterflies were selected, and the difference in the average flying speed for each sample was calculated. A two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for the difference in means was conducted to investigate whether the speed at which monarchs fly, on average, is faster than the speed at which swallowtails fly. All conditions for inference were met, and the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value was given as 0.072.\nWhich of the following is a correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value?",
