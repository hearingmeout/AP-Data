    "question": "Zoologists studying two populations of tigers conducted a two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for the difference in means to investigate whether the tigers in population X weigh more, on average, than the tigers in population Y. Two independent random samples were taken, and the difference between the sample means was calculated. All conditions for inference were met, and the test produced a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.02.\nWhich of the following is a correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value?",
