    "question": "Researchers on car safety studied driver reaction time and cell phone use while driving. Participants in the study talked on either a hands-free phone or a handheld phone while driving in a car simulator. A two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for a difference in means was conducted to investigate whether the mean driver reaction time between the two groups of participants was different. All conditions for inference were met, and the test produced a test statistic of <math alttext=\"t equals negative 2.763\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>2.763</mn></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> and a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.03.\nWhich of the following is a correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value?",
