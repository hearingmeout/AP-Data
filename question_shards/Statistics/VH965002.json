    "question": "A national travel association with over 3,000 members selected a random sample of 100 members of the association. The selected members were asked to report the number of miles they traveled on their last vacation. The mean and standard deviation of the responses were 150 miles and 40 miles, respectively. A graph of the sample data displayed a right skew. The association will construct a confidence interval to estimate the mean number of miles traveled for all members.\nHave the conditions for inference been met?",
