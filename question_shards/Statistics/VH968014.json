    "question": "A survey was conducted to investigate whether there is an association between a person’s age and their thoughts on what a state senate should do about state parks. Participants selected from “leave state parks the way they are,” “increase funding to state parks,” or “completely overhaul state parks,” and their age was categorized as under 30 years old, between 30 and 50 years old, and over 50 years old. The hypothesis test statistic was calculated to be 15.01. Which of the following is closest to the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test?",
