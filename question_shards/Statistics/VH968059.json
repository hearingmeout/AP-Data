    "question": "A chi-square test of independence was conducted to investigate whether there is an association between the location where a person lives in a city (north, south, east, or west) and who the person planned to vote for in the upcoming mayoral election (the incumbent or the challenger). A random sample of 100 potential voters was selected, and the hypothesis test had a chi-square test statistic of <math alttext=\"chi square equals 9.84\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msup><mrow><mi>χ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>9.84</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> with a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.02.
