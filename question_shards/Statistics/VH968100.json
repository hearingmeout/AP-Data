    "question": "An administrator at a local high school wants to investigate whether there is an association between the grade level of a student (either ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth) and how the student commutes to school (either walks, bikes, takes the bus, receives a ride, or drives). After a chi-square test for association was conducted, the results indicated that the chi-square test statistic was 14.63 with a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.2623. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value in the context of the test?",
