    "question": "A chi-square test for homogeneity was conducted to investigate whether the four high schools in a school district have different absentee rates for each of four grade levels. The chi-square test statistic and <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of the test were 19.02 and 0.025, respectively. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value in the context of the test?",
