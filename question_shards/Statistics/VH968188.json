    "question": "A chi-square test was conducted to investigate whether there is an association between a person’s favorite flavor of ice cream and their favorite toppings. Each of 200 randomly selected customers at an ice cream parlor was asked to pick their favorite flavor from vanilla, chocolate, chocolate chip, or none of these. They were also asked to pick their favorite topping from chocolate sauce, peanuts, crumbled cookies, crushed candies, or none of these. The hypothesis test had a test statistic of 24.97 with an associated <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.015. If the significance level of the test was <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> , which of the following is the correct decision for this hypothesis test?",
