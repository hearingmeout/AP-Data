    "question": "A college administrator wanted to know if the proportion of students who request online classes, lab classes, or lecture classes was different at two different campuses. At each campus, the administrator took a random sample of 250 students and asked each student which type of class they preferred. The conditions for the appropriate test were verified, and the chi-square test statistic for the test was calculated to be 4.01 with an associated <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.1347. If the significance level of the test was <math alttext=\"alpha equals .05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, what conclusion should the college administrator make about the proportion of students who request online classes, lab classes, or lecture classes at two different campuses?",
