    "question": "A linguist at a large university was studying the word length of papers submitted by students enrolled in humanities programs. From a random sample of 25 papers, the linguist counted the number of words used in each paper. The 95 percent confidence interval was calculated to be <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 20,955 comma 22,905, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>20</mn><mtext>,995,</mtext><mtext> 22</mtext><mtext>,905</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>.\nAssuming all conditions for inference are met, which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?",
