They constructed the 90 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"6.46 plus or minus 0.41\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mn>6.46</mn><mo>±</mo><mn>0.41</mn></mrow></math> for the mean number of hours per week spent by freshmen in extracurricular activities.\nAssuming all conditions for inference are met, which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?",
