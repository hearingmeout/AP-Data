    "question": "Engineers at a tire manufacturing company investigated the effect of a new rubber compound on the tire life of a certain brand of tires. From a sample of 16 tires, the engineers constructed a 99 percent confidence interval for the mean tire life, in miles, as <math alttext=\"62,550 plus or minus 2,026\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>62</mn><mtext>,550</mtext><mo>±</mo><mn>2</mn><mtext>,026</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>.\nSuppose the company intends to claim a maximum tire life for advertising purposes. Based on the interval, of the following, which is the maximum plausible value for the mean tire life, in miles?",
