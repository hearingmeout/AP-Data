    "question": "Two ride-sharing companies, A and B, provide service for a certain city. A random sample of 52 trips made by Company A and a random sample of 52 trips made by Company B were selected, and the number of miles traveled for each trip was recorded. The difference between the sample means for the two companies <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, A minus B, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> was used to construct the 95 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 1.86 comma 2.15, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1.86</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2.15</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.\nWhich of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?",
