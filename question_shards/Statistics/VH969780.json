    "description": "A biologist studied the frequency of croaks for frogs from two different regions. From a random sample of 32 frogs located in the northern region, the mean number of croaks per hour was 21.3, and from a random sample of 38 frogs located in the southern region, the mean number of croaks per hour was 28.9. To estimate the difference in the mean number of croaks (southern minus northern), a 95 percent confidence interval was constructed from the samples. The interval was reported as <math alttext=\"7.1 comma 8.1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>7.1</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>8.1</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>.",
