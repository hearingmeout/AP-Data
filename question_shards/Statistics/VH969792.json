    "question": "Random samples of players for two types of video games were selected, and the mean number of hours per week spent playing the games was calculated for each group. The sample means were used to construct the 90 percent confidence interval <math alttext=\"1.5 comma 3.8\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1.5</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>3.8</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> for the difference in the mean number of hours per week spent playing the games.\nThe maker of one of the video games claims that there is a difference in the population mean number of hours per week spent playing the two games. Is the claim supported by the interval?",
