    "question": "Researchers collected two different samples, X and Y, of temperatures, in degrees Celsius, of the habitat for Florida scrub lizards. The confidence interval <math alttext=\"36 plus or minus 1.66\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>36</mn><mo>±</mo><mn>1.66</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> was constructed from sample X, and the confidence interval <math alttext=\"36 plus or minus 1.08\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>36</mn><mo>±</mo><mn>1.08</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> was constructed from sample Y. Assume both samples had the same standard deviation. Which of the following statements could explain why the width of the confidence interval constructed from X is greater than the width of the confidence interval constructed from Y?",
