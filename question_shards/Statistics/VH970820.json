    "question": "A company director investigated whether there is a difference in the mean number of overtime hours worked each week by employees assigned to two different managers. Each manager, A and B, manages 100 employees. Random samples of 35 employees from manager A and 40 employees from manager B were selected. The number of overtime hours worked was recorded for the 75 employees each week.\nHave the conditions been met for inference with a confidence interval for the difference in the population means?",

        "label": "Yes, all conditions have been met.",

        "label": "No, because the data were not collected using a random method.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the size of at least one of the samples is greater than 10 percent of the population.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the sample sizes are not large enough to assume the distribution of the difference in sample means is normal.",

      },
      {
        "label": "No, because the sample sizes are not the same.",

    "answer": "No, because the size of at least one of the samples is greater than 10 percent of the population."
