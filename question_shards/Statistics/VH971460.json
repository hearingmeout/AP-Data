    "question": "A recent report indicated that families in a certain country typically spend about $175 per week on groceries. To investigate whether families in a certain city typically spend more than $175 per week, an economist selected a random sample of 500 families in the city and found the sample mean to be $176.24. With all conditions for inference met, a hypothesis test resulted in a <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-value of 0.0021.\nAt the significance level of <math alttext=\"alpha equals 0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, which of the following is a correct conclusion?",
