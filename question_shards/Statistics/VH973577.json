    "question": "A random sample of 500 people were classified by their ages into 3 age-groups: 29 years and younger, 30 to 64 years, and 65 years and older. Each person from the sample was surveyed about which of 4 major brands of cell phone they used. Their responses were compiled and displayed in a 3-by-4 contingency table. A researcher will use the data to investigate whether there is an association between cell phone brand and age-group.\nWhich of the following is the appropriate test for the investigation?",
