    "question": "A study was conducted to investigate whether the mean numbers of snack bars sold at two airport convenience stores, C and D, were different. For ten randomly selected days, the number of snack bars sold at each store was recorded, and the sample mean number of snack bars for each store was calculated. A two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for a difference in means will be conducted.\nHave all conditions for inference been met?",
