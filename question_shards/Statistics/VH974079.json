    "question": "A two-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for a difference in means will be conducted to investigate mean gasoline prices in two states. From each state, 45 gasoline stations will be selected at random. On the same day, the price of regular gasoline will be recorded for each selected station and the sample mean price for each state will be calculated.\nHave all conditions for inference been met?",
