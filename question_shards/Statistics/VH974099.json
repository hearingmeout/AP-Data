    "question": "Jimmy likes to listen to a variety of music. His library has the following distribution of music genres.\n\nMusic Type \n\nCountry \n\nR&B \n\nPop \n\nRetro \n\nRock \n\nPercent \n22% \n10% \n12% \n20% \n36% \n\nJimmy believes that the shuffle feature on his music player is malfunctioning by not playing songs that meet this distribution of music types. To test this, he listens to 100 songs randomly chosen when his player is in shuffle mode and records the number of songs in each category. Which inference procedure should he use to test whether or not the shuffle feature is working correctly?",
