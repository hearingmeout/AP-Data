    "question": "A forester reported the following distribution of tree types to a local logging company.\n\nTree Type \n\nSpruce \n\nPine \n\nFir \n\nDeciduous \n\nOther \n\nPercent \n52% \n22% \n8% \n10% \n8% \n\nThe logging company generated a random sample of 100 trees and observed the following distribution of trees in each of the categories.\n\nTree Type\nSpruce\nPine\nFir\nDeciduous\nOther\n\nObserved Count\n51\n21\n10\n9\n9\n\nThe logging company would like to use its sample to provide convincing statistical evidence that over 50 percent of the trees in the forest are spruce trees. The logging company has decided to use a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to justify its claim. Why is the chi-square goodness-of-fit test not an appropriate procedure for the logging company to use?",
