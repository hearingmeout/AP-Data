    "question": "A company claims it audits its employees’ transactions based on their job level. For entry-level positions, the company claims that 50 percent get a basic audit, 30 percent get an enhanced audit, and 20 percent get a complete audit. The company tests this hypothesis using a random sample and finds <math alttext=\"chi square equals 0.771\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msup><mrow><mi>χ</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.771</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> with a corresponding <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>–value of 0.68. Assuming conditions for inference were met, which of the following is the correct interpretation of the <math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>–value?",
