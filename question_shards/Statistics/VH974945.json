    "question": "The table displays the distribution of the percentage of different types of home heating sources for a large mountain city, as reported by the city newspaper.\n\nType of Heating Source \n\nWood Stove \n\nElectric \n\nPropane/Gas \n\nSolar Radiant Floor \n\nPercent \n38% \n26% \n20% \n16% \n\nA chi-square goodness-of-fit test will be performed using a simple random sample of 100 homes to investigate whether the proportion of homes heated with each source is the same as what is reported by the newspaper. Which of the following represents the alternative hypothesis of the test?",
