    "description": "An experiment was conducted in which planks of wood painted red and green were shown to pigeons to investigate a pigeon’s ability to select a certain color. Pigeons could accurately select the color of the plank of wood 20 percent of the time. A simulation was conducted in which a trial consisted of a pigeon being shown eight planks of wood and its number of successes being recorded. This process was repeated many times, and the results are shown in the histogram.",
    "question": "Based on the results of the simulation, which of the following is closest to the probability that there were at most three successes in a trial?",
