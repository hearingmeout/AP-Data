    "question": "A fisheries biologist collected a random sample of fish from a lake and conducted a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to see if the distribution of fish changed over time. The table below shows the distribution of fish that were put into the lake when it was originally stocked.\n\nFish Type \n\nTrout \n\nBass \n\nPerch \n\nSunfish \n\nCatfish \n\nPercent \n25% \n25% \n20% \n15% \n15% \n\nThe biologist found evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Which of the following represents the alternative hypothesis of the test?",
