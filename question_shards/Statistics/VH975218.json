    "description": "An experiment was conducted to investigate whether there is a difference in mean bag strengths for two different brands of paper sandwich bags. A random sample of 50 bags from each of Brand X and Brand Y was selected. Each bag was held from its rim, and one-ounce weights were dropped into the bag one at a time from the same height until the bag ripped. The number of ounces the bag held before ripping was recorded, and the mean number of ounces for each brand was calculated.",
    "question": "Which of the following is the appropriate test for the study?",
