    "question": "Data was collected from a simple random sample of 200 cell phone users age 18 or older in the United States. Each user was categorized by age-group and by whether he or she uses a certain cell phone app. The table shown summarizes the data, with expected cell counts in parentheses.\n\nUses Cell Phone App \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nTotal \n\nAge-Group \n\nYoung Adults \n4 (15.2) \n76 (64.8) \n80 \n\nOlder Adults \n29 (19.38) \n73 (82.62) \n102 \n\nElderly Adults \n5 (3.42) \n13 (14.58) \n18 \n\nTotal \n38 \n162 \n200 \n\nWhich statement is true about whether the conditions for a chi-square test for independence have been met?",
