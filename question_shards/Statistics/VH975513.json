    "description": "In 2010, a medical research group reported the results of an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat a chronic intestinal condition. A group of volunteers with the chronic intestinal condition agreed to participate in the experiment and be randomly assigned to either a true acupuncture treatment or a placebo treatment. The placebo treatment mimicked the application of acupuncture, but no needle penetrated the skin. Random assignment resulted in 78 subjects receiving acupuncture and 75 subjects receiving the placebo treatment. After receiving 6 treatments over the course of 3 weeks, patients were asked to report whether they had experienced a reduction in the chronic intestinal condition. The table summarizes the data from the study, with expected cell counts in parentheses.",
