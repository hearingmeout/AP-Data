    "question": "A local convenience store in a large city closes each day at 10 P.M. The owner of the store is investigating whether mean sales will increase by at least $10 per day if the store remains open until 11 P.M. The owner asked the 41 members of a local civic group to estimate the amount of money they might spend during the extra hour. The sample mean was $11.50. The owner will conduct a one-sample <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for a population mean.\nHave the conditions for inference been met?",
