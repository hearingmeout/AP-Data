    "question": "Jana, a high school principal, hosted a movie event at her school. Jana’s assistant kept track of the number of students in each grade who attended the event. The distribution shown in the table represents the number of students in each grade that were present.\nGrade Level Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior Number 52 56 60 70 \nJana knows that the grade levels are equally distributed across the school of 1,200 students. She would like to use a chi-square test to see if the proportion of individuals in each class at the movie are also equally distributed. How many seniors would be expected at the event?",
