    "description": "Horseshoe crabs on a beach can be overturned by approaching waves. These “stranded” crabs may right themselves by turning over. During a period of many days on an Atlantic Ocean beach, investigators categorized a random sample of crabs as either stranded or not stranded and additionally noted their age category. The researchers wanted to investigate whether there is convincing evidence of an association between becoming stranded and age. Data from their study are shown in the following table.",
