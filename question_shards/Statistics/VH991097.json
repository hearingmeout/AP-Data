    "question": "A researcher is investigating the relationship between the length, in centimeters, and weight, in grams, of pineapples. The researcher will select a random sample of 15 pineapples from grocery stores in a region and construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line, where length is the explanatory variable and weight is the response variable.\nWhen computing a confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line, which of the following is not a condition that must be checked?",
