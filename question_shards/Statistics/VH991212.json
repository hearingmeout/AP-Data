    "question": "A business school is conducting a study to investigate whether a students’ scores on a placement test can be used to predict students’ starting salaries. Based on a random sample of 200 graduates of the business school, a 98 percent confidence interval for the slope of the linear regression line relating placement scores and starting salary is calculated to be <math alttext=\"315 comma 336\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>315</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>336</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>. Assume the conditions for inference are met.\nWhich of the following is a correct interpretation of the confidence interval?",
