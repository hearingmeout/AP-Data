    "question": "Biologists are interested in how temperature changes might affect the frequency of mating calls of frogs. Twenty gray tree frogs are randomly chosen for a study. For each frog, the temperature of its habitat (in degrees Celsius) and the frequency of its mating call (in tones per second) are recorded.\n\nThe 96 percent confidence interval for estimating the population slope of the linear regression line predicting mating call frequency based on habitat temperature is given by <math alttext=\"2.341 plus or minus 0.768\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mn>2.341</mn><mo>±</mo><mn>0.768</mn></mrow></math>.\n\nAssume that the conditions for inference for the slope of the regression line have been met. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the calculated confidence interval?",
