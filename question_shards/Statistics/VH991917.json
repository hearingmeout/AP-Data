    "question": "An international organization is investigating the relationship between the life expectancies of men and women in nonindustrialized countries. A random sample of such countries was selected, and life expectancies, in years, were determined for both men and women. A check of the conditions necessary for inference on the slope of a regression line shows that they are met.\nA 98 percent confidence interval for the slope of the regression line relating life expectancy for men, <math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></math>, and women, <math alttext=\"y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></math>, is given by <math alttext=\"1.01 comma 1.34\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1.01</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>1.34</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.
