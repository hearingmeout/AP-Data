    "question": "A reporter was interested in the relationship between the size of a dining party and the amount of time it takes for the dining party to be seated at a restaurant. The reporter selected a random sample of dining parties from a certain region. The resulting data were used to complete a linear regression analysis of the time, in minutes, it takes for a dining party to be seated versus the number of people in the dining party. The linear regression analysis produced the residual plot shown.\n\nBased on the residual plot, which condition for inference for the slope of the regression line does not appear to be satisfied?",
