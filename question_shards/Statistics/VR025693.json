    "description": "To investigate whether the consumption of beetroot juice enhances exercise performance, a researcher selected a random sample of <math alttext=\"50\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mstyle> <mrow> <mn>50</mn> </mrow> </mstyle> </math> student athletes from all the student athletes at a college. The athletes in the sample were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In one group, <math alttext=\"25\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> athletes were given a daily dose of beetroot juice, and in the other group, the remaining athletes were given a daily dose of a placebo. At the end of six weeks of exercise training, the researcher compared the performances of the two groups.",
