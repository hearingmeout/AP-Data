    "description": "College researchers wanted to know under what conditions people are more likely to complete and return a survey. As part of a study, the researchers prepared three sets of identical surveys and used three methods of delivering and returning the surveys. The methods are described as follows.\n\nIn Class: The surveys were given to students in a class, and students were asked to return completed surveys to their instructor.\n\nPsychology: The surveys were given to students participating in a psychology experiment, and students were asked to return completed surveys to a collection box in the hallway of the psychology building.\n\nDining Hall: The surveys were given to students in the dining hall, and students were asked to return completed surveys to a collection box outside the dining hall.\n\nThe graph shows the percent of surveys returned and not returned for each delivery method.",
    "question": "Which statement about delivery method and rate of survey return is supported by the graph?",
