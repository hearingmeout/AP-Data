    "description": "A student working on a physics project investigated the relationship between the speed and the height of roller coasters. The student collected data on the maximum speed, in miles per hour, and the maximum height, in feet, for a random sample of <math alttext=\"21\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>21</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> roller coasters, with the intent of testing the slope of the linear relationship between maximum speed and maximum height. However, based on the residual plot shown, the conditions for such a test might not be met.",
    "question": "Based on the residual plot, which condition appears to have been violated?",
