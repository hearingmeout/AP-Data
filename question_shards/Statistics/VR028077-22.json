  "content": {
    "description": "For each day that Sasha travels to work, the probability that she will experience a delay due to traffic is 0.2. Each day can be considered independent of the other days.",
    "question": "(a) For the next 21 days that Sasha travels to work, what is the probability that Sasha will experience a delay due to traffic on at least 3 of the days?\n\n(b) What is the probability that Sasha’s first delay due to traffic will occur after the fifth day of travel to work?\n\n(c) Consider a random sample of 21 days that Sasha will travel to work. For the proportion of those days that she will experience a delay due to traffic, is the sampling distribution of the sample proportion approximately normal? Justify your answer.",
