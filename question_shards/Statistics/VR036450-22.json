Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA polling agency is investigating the voter support for a ballot measure in an upcoming city election. The agency will select a random sample of 500 voters from one region, Region A, of the city. Assume that the population proportion of voters who would support the ballot measure in Region A is 0.47.\n\n(a) What is the probability that the proportion of voters in the sample of Region A who support the ballot measure is greater than 0.50 ?",
