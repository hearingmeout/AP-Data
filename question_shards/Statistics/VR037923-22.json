    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA team of psychologists studied the concept of visualization in basketball, where players visualize making a basket before shooting the ball. They conducted an experiment in which 20 basketball players with similar abilities were randomly assigned to two groups. The 10 players in group 1 received visualization training, and the 10 players in group 2 did not.\n\nEach player stood 22 feet from the basket at the same location on the basketball court. Each player was then instructed to attempt to make the basket until two consecutive baskets were made. The players who received visualization training were instructed to use visualization techniques before attempting to make the basket. The total number of attempts, including the last two attempts, were recorded for each player.\n\nThe total number of attempts for each of the 20 players are summarized in the following boxplots.\n\n(a) Based on the boxplots, did basketball players who received visualization training tend to need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than players who did not receive the training? Explain your reasoning.",
