    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.  \n\nA recent study reported that high school students spend an average of <math alttext=\"94\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>94</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> minutes per day texting. Jenna claims that the average for the students at her large high school is greater than <math alttext=\"94\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>94</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> minutes. She will conduct a study to investigate this claim.\n\n(a) To collect data, Jenna will select a sample of size <math alttext=\"32\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>32</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> from the population.\n(i) State Jenna’s population of interest.\n(ii) Name and describe a sampling method Jenna could use that will satisfy the conditions needed for inference to the population.",
