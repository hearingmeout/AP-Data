Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nTo increase morale among employees, a company began a program in which one employee is randomly selected each week to receive a gift card. Each of the company’s <math alttext=\"200\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>200</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> employees is equally likely to be selected each week, and the same employee could be selected more than once. Each week’s selection is independent from every other week.\n\n(a) Consider the probability that a particular employee receives at least one gift card in a <math alttext=\"52\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>52</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>-week year.\n(i) Define the random variable of interest and state how the random variable is distributed.\n(ii) Determine the probability that a particular employee receives at least one gift card in a <math alttext=\"52\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>52</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>-week year.
