    "question": "Researchers conducted a study to investigate whether watching an outdoor scene while exercising improves health more than exercise alone. Fourteen fifth-grade students participated in two trials of the study. For one trial, the students rode a stationary bicycle for <math alttext=\"15\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> minutes while watching a video of someone cycling through a forest. For the other trial, the students rode a stationary bicycle for <math alttext=\"15\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> minutes without watching a video. Each student completed both trials in a randomized order. The researchers recorded the students’ heart rates after each trial.\nWhich of the following is the best description of the study?",
