    "question": "A college professor administered a survey to students from three different majors: engineering, nursing, and communications. The students were asked to identify how they prefer to be contacted: e-mail, telephone, or text message. The professor then used the survey data to conduct a chi-square test.\nWhich of the following best describes the null hypothesis for the test?",

      {
        "label": "There is an association between major and preferred method of communication.",
