    "description": "A six-week training program was developed to help student athletes improve performance on a certain task. To study the effectiveness of the program, researchers randomly selected <math alttext=\"50\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>50</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> student athletes. The students were tested before participating in the program. Then, half the athletes were randomly assigned to participate in the program and the other half were allowed to train on their own. At the end of the six weeks, all athletes were tested again. The researchers reported that the athletes who participated in the program increased their scores, on average, by <math alttext=\"200\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>200</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> points, whereas those who did not participate raised their scores, on average, by <math alttext=\"80\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>80</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> points.",
    "question": "After reading the results of the study, Jasmine, a student athlete, decided to enroll in the program. At the end of six weeks, her score had increased by <math alttext=\"80\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>80</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> points. Which of the following is an explanation for the difference between Jasmine’s score and the scores that the study reported for student athletes who participated in the program?",
