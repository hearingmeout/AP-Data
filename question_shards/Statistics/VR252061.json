Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Many people who suffer from a common skin ailment decide to buy a generic brand skin cream instead of a name-brand skin cream because of cost savings. A skin doctor plans to investigate the following claim made in an advertisement. The generic brand of a skin cream is less effective in curing a common skin ailment than a name-brand skin cream. The doctor is considering the following two options for the design of a study: Option A: Obtain <math alttext=\"500\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>500</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers from the population of people with the skin ailment who use the generic brand skin cream each day. Obtain <math alttext=\"500\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>500</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers from the population of people with the skin ailment who use the name-brand skin cream each day. Observe the number of people cured in each group after six months. Option B: Randomly assign <math alttext=\"1,000\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mtext>,000</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers with the skin ailment to one of two groups, each with <math alttext=\"500\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>500</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> people.
