    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that typically occurs with people whose feet become sweaty while wearing tight-fitting shoes. An athletic trainer will investigate the following claim made in an article on foot health. The prescription foot ointment is more effective in curing athlete’s foot than the over-the-counter foot ointment. The trainer is considering the following two options for the design of a study: Plan A: Randomly assign <math alttext=\"400\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>400</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers with athlete’s foot to one of two groups, each with <math alttext=\"200\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>200</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> people. Give the prescription foot ointment to one group to be used each day and the over-the-counter foot ointment to the other group to be used each day. Observe the number of people cured in each group after one month. Plan B: Obtain <math alttext=\"200\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>200</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers with athlete’s foot who use the prescription foot ointment each day. Obtain <math alttext=\"200\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>200</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers with athlete’s foot who use the over-the-counter foot ointment each day. Observe the number of people cured in each group after one month. (a) Give a reason why Plan A is more appropriate than Plan B for investigating the effectiveness of the foot ointments. Justify your answer in the context of the problem.",
