    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A researcher conducted a study to investigate whether a certain dog food supplement is effective in promoting healthier dog fur in two weeks or less. The researcher randomly selected <math alttext=\"25\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> dogs from the dogs at a large animal shelter for the study. At the beginning of the study, each of the <math alttext=\"25\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> dogs had its fur rated on a scale from <math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> to <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math>, with higher values indicating healthier fur. The dogs were then given the supplement, and after two weeks each dog’s fur was rated using the same scale. All other variables were held constant within the two weeks. The difference in the fur ratings (after supplement minus before supplement) was recorded, and the results are shown in the following dotplot. (a) Explain what a negative difference indicates in the context of the study.",
