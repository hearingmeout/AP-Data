    "question": "Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA gardener at a local nursery conducted a study to investigate whether organic fertilizer increases the number of rose blooms on a certain variety of rosebush. The gardener randomly selected <math alttext=\"35\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>35</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> rosebushes from the nursery. The number of rose blooms on each of the <math alttext=\"35\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>35</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> rosebushes was recorded before any fertilizer was applied and again one month after the fertilizer was applied. All other variables were held constant over the one month period. The stemplot shows the difference in the number of rose blooms (before fertilizer minus after fertilizer).\n\n(a) Explain what a negative difference indicates in the context of the study.",
