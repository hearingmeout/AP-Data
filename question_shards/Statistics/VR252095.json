Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that usually begins between a person’s toes. Consider a study designed to investigate the following claim. A disinfectant foot ointment is effective in curing athlete’s foot. Two designs are proposed for the study. Method A Method B Randomly select <math alttext=\"110\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>110</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> people from the population of people who have athlete’s foot to use the disinfectant foot ointment each day and observe the number of people cured after two weeks. Obtain <math alttext=\"110\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>110</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers from the population of people who have athlete’s foot. Randomly assign <math alttext=\"80\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>80</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> of the volunteers to use the disinfectant foot ointment each day. Assign the remaining <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers to use a placebo each day. Observe the number of people cured in each group after two weeks. (a) Give an example of what people assigned to use a placebo in Method B might be asked to use instead of the disinfectant foot ointment. Explain the benefit of the placebo in the context of the study.",
