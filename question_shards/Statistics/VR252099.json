Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Swimmer’s ear is an infection of the outer ear canal. Consider a study designed to investigate the following claim. A prescription ear drop is effective in relieving swimmer’s ear. Two designs are proposed for the study. Design A: Obtain <math alttext=\"125\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>125</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers from the population of people with swimmer’s ear. Randomly assign <math alttext=\"75\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>75</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> of the volunteers to use the prescription ear drop each day. Assign the remaining <math alttext=\"50\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>50</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> volunteers to use a placebo each day. Observe the number of people who experience relief from swimmer’s ear in each group after two weeks. Design B: Randomly select <math alttext=\"125\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>125</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> people from the population of people who have swimmer’s ear to use the prescription ear drop each day and observe the number of people who experience relief from swimmer’s ear after two weeks. (a) Give an example of what people assigned to use a placebo in Design A might be asked to use instead of the prescription ear drop. Explain the benefit of the placebo in the context of the study.",
