Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A commercial laundry company that cleans uniforms for a large mail delivery business plans to investigate the effectiveness of two different laundry detergents (G and T) in cleaning dirty uniforms for the drivers of the delivery business. The uniforms are composed of two garments: a shirt and a pair of shorts, both of which are the same fabric and color and receive the same amount of wear when worn by the delivery drivers. A random sample of <math alttext=\"40\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> dirty uniforms was selected from those sent by the delivery business and Detergent G was randomly assigned to clean the shirt for <math alttext=\"20\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> uniforms and the pair of shorts for the other <math alttext=\"20\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> uniforms.
