    "question": "Caleb designed an experiment to investigate whether listening to music or chewing gum affects the time to complete a level of a certain video game. Before the game started, each person in a sample was randomly assigned to either listen to music or not listen to music. Each person was also randomly assigned to either chew gum or not chew gum. At the end of the game, the time to complete the level for each person in the sample was recorded.\nWhich of the following correctly identifies the response variable of the experiment and whether the variable is categorical or quantitative?",
