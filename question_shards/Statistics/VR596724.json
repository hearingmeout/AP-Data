    "question": "A common measure of flexibility is the sit-and-reach test, where a person sits on the floor with legs straight in front. The person then reaches as far forward as possible, and the distance reached past the feet is recorded. The histograms summarize the results of the sit-and-reach test for two groups, young adult men and middle-aged men. Negative distances represent a reach that is not as far as the feet.\n\nWhich of the following statements is the best description of the distributions of distances?",
