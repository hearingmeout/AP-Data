    "question": "Researchers are examining the relationship between hours of sleep and athletic performance among college athletes. Athletic performance will be measured on a numeric scale, with greater numbers indicating better performance. The researchers expect that the more hours the athletes sleep, the better they will perform. Assuming all conditions for inference are met, the researchers will create a <math alttext=\"95\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>95</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> percent confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for predicting athletic performance from amount of sleep.\nFor which of the following would the confidence interval support the researchers’ expectations?",
