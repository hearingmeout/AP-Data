Suppose that the hypothesis test is conducted using a significance level of <math alttext=\"0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.05</mn></math> and the power of the test is determined for a specific alternative value using the significance level of <math alttext=\"0.05\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.05</mn></math>.\nIf the significance level of the hypothesis test is changed to <math alttext=\"0.01\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.01</mn></math> and the power of the test is computed for the same alternative value using a significance level of <math alttext=\"0.01\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.01</mn></math>, which of the following best describes the change(s) to the probability of a Type <math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>I</mtext></math> error and the power of the test?",
