    "question": "A university that offers evening classes to a large number of students who commute to campus wants to estimate the mean commute time of all evening students. A parking facilities attendant selects one parking lot on campus, then selects the first <math alttext=\"60 students\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mn>60</mn> </math> students who drive into the lot on a certain evening. Each of the <math alttext=\"60 students\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mn>60</mn> </math> students is asked to provide their typical commute time to campus. The university will create a confidence interval for the mean commute time of evening students.\n\nAre the conditions for inference satisfied?",
