Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nStudies have shown that foods rich in compounds known as flavonoids help lower blood pressure. Researchers conducted a study to investigate whether there was a greater reduction in blood pressure for people who consumed dark chocolate, which contains flavonoids, than people who consumed white chocolate, which does not contain flavonoids. Twenty-five healthy adults agreed to participate in the study and add <math alttext=\"3.5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>3.5</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> ounces of chocolate to their daily diets.
