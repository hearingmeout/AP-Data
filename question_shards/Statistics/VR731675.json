    "question": "A botanist is studying the weights, measured in pounds, of pumpkins grown at two different farms. The boxplots show the distribution of pumpkin weight for two samples of equal size, one from farm A and the other from farm B.\n\nBased on the boxplots, which of the following is a correct conclusion about the distribution of pumpkin weight for the samples from the two farms?",
