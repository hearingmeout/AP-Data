To investigate how satisfied the participants were with the fair, the fair director conducted a survey. The director randomly selected <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> of the groups participating in the fair and surveyed all members of the selected groups.\n\nWhich statement best describes the sampling method used by the director?",
