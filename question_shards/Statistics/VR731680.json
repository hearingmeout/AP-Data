    "question": "A data scientist had <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> different sets of data. For each data set the scientist fit a least-squares regression line, then graphed the residuals versus the predicted values for each. Which residual plot indicates that the least-squares regression model was the most appropriate model to fit the data?",

The data points begin in the lower left portion of the plane, and trend upward and to the right initially. The data points increase in number as the trend reaches a maximum at the point with coordinates 104 comma 1. The data points then trend downward and to the right and decrease in number as the trend approaches the lower right portion of the plane, where it ends. Note that all coordinate values are approximate.",
