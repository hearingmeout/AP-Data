    "description": "A chocolatier, a person who makes chocolate candy, at a candy company has developed a new dark chocolate candy and believes it will be less bitter than the current dark chocolate candy on the market. The chocolatier hired <math alttext=\"40\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>40</mn></math> professional taste testers to participate in an experiment. The chocolatier flipped a coin for each participant. If the coin landed on heads, the participant tasted the new dark chocolate candy first, then tasted the current dark chocolate candy. If the coin landed on tails, the participant tasted the current dark chocolate candy first, then tasted the new dark chocolate candy. The participants rated the bitterness of each dark chocolate candy on a scale of <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>, with <math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math> being the least bitter and <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> being the most bitter. Using a paired <math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi></math>-test to test the belief, the chocolatier calculated a <math alttext=\"p\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>p</mi></math>-value of <math alttext=\"0.274\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0.274</mn></math>.",
