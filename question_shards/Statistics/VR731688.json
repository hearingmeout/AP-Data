    "question": "A prize game at a circus has a spinner with <math alttext=\"12\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>12</mn></math> sections, where each section is equally likely to be selected when the spinner is spun. There are <math alttext=\"7\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>7</mn></math> blue sections and <math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math> orange sections. Camille has spun the spinner <math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math> times and the pattern of outcomes was orange, blue, orange, blue. Camille will spin the spinner two more times.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?",
