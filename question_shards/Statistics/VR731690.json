    "question": "Voters in a certain large county will have an opportunity to vote for or against a new environmental rule that would incentivize the return of certain used batteries to a county-certified recycling facility. The results of a previous poll found that <math alttext=\"41\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>41</mn></math> percent of registered voters in that county plan to vote for the environmental rule. Juwan, an engineer working at the recycling facility, randomly selected <math alttext=\"15\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>15</mn></math> registered voters and asked whether they plan to vote for the rule.\nAssuming that <math alttext=\"41\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>41</mn></math> percent represents the actual percent of registered voters in the county who plan to vote for the environmental rule, which of the following is closest to the probability that at most <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> of the registered voters Juwan selected plan to vote for the environmental rule?",
