    "question": "Students in an online course are each randomly assigned to receive either standard practice exercises or adaptive practice exercises. For the adaptive practice exercises, the next question asked is determined by whether the student got the previous question correct. The teacher of the course wants to determine whether there is a difference between the two practice exercise types by comparing the proportion of students who pass the course from each group. The teacher plans to test the null hypothesis that <math alttext=\"p sub S, end sub, equals p sub A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></msub></math> versus the alternative hypothesis <math alttext=\"p sub S, end sub, is not equal to p sub A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi></msub><mo>≠</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></msub></math>, where <math alttext=\"p sub S\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi></msub></math> represents the proportion of students who would pass the course using standard practice exercises and <math alttext=\"p sub A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></msub></math> represents the proportion of students who would pass the course using adaptive practice exercises.\nThe teacher knows that the <math alttext=\"99\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>99</mn></math> percent confidence interval for the difference in proportion of students passing the course for the two practice exercise types (standard minus adaptive) is <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 0.03 comma 0.24, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mn>0.03</mn></mpadded><mo>,</mo><mpadded><mn>0.24</mn></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math> and the <math alttext=\"90\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>90</mn></math> percent confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of students passing the course for the two practice exercise types (standard minus adaptive) is <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 0.06 comma 0.21, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mn>0.06</mn></mpadded><mo>,</mo><mpadded><mn>0.21</mn></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math>.
