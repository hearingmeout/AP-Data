Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. A large city is considering increasing the number of buses running on a certain route. To determine whether there is a need for more buses, a random sample of <math alttext=\"58\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>58</mn></math> people at bus stops along the route is selected. The amount of time a person waits until a bus arrives is recorded to the nearest tenth of a minute for each person. The histogram shows the distribution of wait time. The first bar includes values from <math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"1.9\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1.9</mn></math> minutes, the second bar includes values from <math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"3.9\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3.9</mn></math> minutes, and so on. (a) Based on the distribution of wait time shown in the histogram, what would be a statistical advantage of using the sample median rather than the sample mean as the estimate of the typical wait time?",
