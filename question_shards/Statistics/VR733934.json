Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA developer wants to know whether adding fibers to concrete used in paving driveways will reduce the severity of cracking, because any driveway with severe cracks will have to be repaired by the developer. The developer conducts a completely randomized experiment with <math alttext=\"60\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>60</mn></math> new homes that need driveways. Thirty of the driveways will be randomly assigned to receive concrete that contains fibers, and the other <math alttext=\"30\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>30</mn></math> driveways will receive concrete that does not contain fibers. After one year, the developer will record the severity of cracks in each driveway on a scale of <math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> to <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math>, with <math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>0</mn></math> representing not cracked at all and <math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math> representing severely cracked.\n\n(a) Based on the information provided about the developer’s experiment, identify each of the following.\n\nExperimental units\n\nTreatments\n\nResponse variable",
