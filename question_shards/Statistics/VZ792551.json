    "question": "A new type of fish food has become available for salmon raised on fish farms. Your task is to design an experiment to compare the weight gain of salmon raised over a six-month period on the new and the old types of food. The salmon that you will use for this experiment have already been randomly placed in eight large tanks in a room that has a considerable temperature gradient. Specifically, tanks on the north side of the room tend to be much colder than those on the south side. The arrangement of tanks is shown on the diagram below. Describe a design for this experiment that takes account of the temperature gradient.",
