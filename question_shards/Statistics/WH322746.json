    "question": "A newspaper article claims that 92 percent of teens use social media. To investigate the claim, a polling organization selected a random sample of 100 teens, and 96 teens in the sample indicated that they use social media. Given the data, why is it not appropriate to use a one-sample <math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></math>-test for a proportion to test the newspaper’s claim?",
