    "question": "A regional transportation authority is interested in estimating the mean number of minutes working adults in the region spend commuting to work on a typical day. A random sample of working adults will be selected from each of three strata: urban, suburban, and rural. Selected individuals will be asked the number of minutes they spend commuting to work on a typical day. Why is stratification used in this situation?",
