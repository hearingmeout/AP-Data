    "question": "In a certain population of birds, about 40 percent of the birds have a wingspan greater than 10 inches. Biologists studying the birds will create a simulation with random numbers to estimate the probability of finding 1 bird in a sample of 6 birds with a wingspan greater than 10 inches. Which of the following assignments of the digits 0 to 9 will model the population?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "Let the even digits represent birds with a wingspan greater than 10 inches and the odd digits represent birds with a wingspan less than or equal to 10 inches.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "Let the digits 0 and 1 represent birds with a wingspan greater than 10 inches and the remaining digits represent birds with a wingspan less than or equal to 10 inches.",

      },
      {
        "label": "Let the digits from 0 to 2 represent birds with a wingspan greater than 10 inches and the remaining digits represent birds with a wingspan less than or equal to 10 inches.",
