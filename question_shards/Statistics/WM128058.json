    "question": "Sasha selected a random sample of bivariate data, with a sample size of 30, and calculated a slope of 3.6 for the sample slope of a regression model. Sasha constructed a 95 percent confidence interval to estimate the slope. Alex claims he can construct a confidence interval that is narrower by changing the sample size but keeping all other things the same. Which of the following sample sizes will make Alex's claim true?",
