    "question": "Donald believes that western commuters drive an average of 10 miles more per day than eastern commuters do. He selects random samples from each group. The western mean is 23.5 miles, and the eastern mean is 19.4 miles. A 95 percent confidence interval to estimate the difference in population means, in miles, is <math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 2.5 comma 5.7, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2.5</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>5.7</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>.
