    "question": "The figure above summarizes the heights, in centimeters, of approximately 400 pine seedlings six years after they were planted at a center for environmental study. Approximately half of the trees were fertilized yearly, and the remaining trees were never fertilized. Which of the following statements about the medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the heights of the two groups of trees 6 years after being planted is true?",
