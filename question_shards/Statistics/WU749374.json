    "question": "A company famous for its nacho-flavored corn chips has developed two new formulas, A and B, which they hope their customers will like even more than the original formula. To determine whether customers prefer one of the new formulas over the current nacho flavoring, a sample of 50 customers is obtained. Each customer tastes both formula A and formula B in a randomly assigned order and indicates which one they prefer more. Which of the following best describes this study?",
    "image": null,
    "choices": [
      {
        "label": "This study is not well designed because there is no replication. Each customer tasted the formulas only once.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "This study is not well designed because formulas A and B are not compared with the original formula.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "This study is not well designed because the sample may not have been randomly selected.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "This study is not well designed because each customer should taste the two new formulas in the same order.",
        "image": null
      },
      {
        "label": "This study is not well designed because there is not enough replication with only 50 customers.",
        "image": null
      }
    ],
    "answer": "This study is not well designed because formulas A and B are not compared with the original formula."
