    "question": "Athletes in a particular sport are classified as either offense or defense. The distribution of weights for the athletes classified as offense is approximately normal, centered at 200 pounds, and ranges from 150 pounds to 250 pounds. The distribution of weights for the athletes classified as defense is approximately normal, centered at 300 pounds, and ranges from 250 pounds to 350 pounds. There are 1,000 athletes in each classification. Which of the following is the best description of a histogram of the weights of all 2,000 athletes?",
