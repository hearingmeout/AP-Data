    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations. Swedish researchers investigated the relationship between chocolate consumption and stroke. The researchers gave a questionnaire about eating habits to a randomly selected sample of Swedish men. Based on the responses to the questionnaire, the men were classified into two groups. Group A consisted of the 9,250 men who ate the most chocolate per week, and group B consisted of the 9,250 men who ate the least chocolate per week. The researchers tracked the men’s health for ten years. During that time, there were 458 cases of stroke among the men in group A and 543 cases of stroke among the men in group B. Do the data provide convincing statistical evidence that Swedish men who would be classified into group A have a lower probability of stroke than Swedish men who would be classified into group B? A report in a newspaper concluded that Swedish men can reduce their probability of stroke by eating more chocolate. Based on the description of the investigation, was the conclusion appropriate? Justify your answer.",
