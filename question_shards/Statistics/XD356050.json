    "question": "A recent study was conducted to investigate the duration of time required to complete a certain manual dexterity task. The reported mean was 10.2 seconds with a standard deviation of 16.0 seconds. Suppose the reported values are the true mean and standard deviation for the population of subjects in the study. If a random sample of 144 subjects is selected from the population, what is the approximate probability that the mean of the sample will be more than 11.0 seconds?",
