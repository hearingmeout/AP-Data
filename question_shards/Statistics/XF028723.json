    "question": "A researcher is interested in the relationship between time spent browsing items in an online store and the total amount purchased from the store. The researcher selects a random sample of visitors to the online store and records the time spent browsing and the total amount of their purchase. The researcher will conduct a <math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-test for the slope of a regression line, where time spent browsing is the explanatory variable and total amount of purchase is the response variable. Which of the following would be an indication that the normality condition has been met?",
