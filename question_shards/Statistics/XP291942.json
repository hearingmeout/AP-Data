If <math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math> or more bottles in the selected box are underfilled, the entire crate will be rejected and sent back to the manufacturing company.(b) The beauty supply warehouse manager is interested in the probability that a crate shipped to the warehouse will be rejected.
