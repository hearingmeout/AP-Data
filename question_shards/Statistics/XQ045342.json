    "question": "At Mike’s favorite coffee shop, the coffee of the day is either a dark roast, a medium roast, or a light roast. From past experience, Mike knows that the probability of the coffee being a light roast is 0.15 and the probability of the coffee being a dark roast is 0.25. What is the probability of the coffee of the day not being a light roast or a dark roast on the next day that Mike visits the coffee shop?",
