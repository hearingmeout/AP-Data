    "question": "From a random sample of 50 people, sitting pulse rates and standing pulse rates were measured for each person. A coin was flipped to determine whether the sitting or the standing pulse rate would be measured first. Let µsitting represent the mean sitting pulse rate in the population, µstanding represent the mean standing pulse rate in the population, and µd represent the mean of the differences between the sitting and standing (sitting - standing) pulse rates in the population. Which of the following represents an appropriate test and hypotheses to determine if there is a difference in mean pulse rates between sitting and standing in the population?",
