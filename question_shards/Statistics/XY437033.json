    "question": "Researchers will conduct a study of the television-viewing habits of children. They will select a simple random sample of children and record the number of hours of television the children watch per week. The researchers will report the sample mean as a point estimate for the population mean. Which of the following statements is correct for the sample mean as a point estimator?",
