    "question": "An engineer is developing a polymer material and is concerned that the mean density, d, of the material is not sufficiently close to the desired target value of 1.37 kilograms per milliliter (kg/mL). Nine different samples of the material were prepared. The volumes, in milliliters, for the samples were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90. The engineer carefully measured the mass (in kilograms) of each sample. For the range of volumes, the true density, d, (in kg/mL) of the material can be estimated by the slope of the least-squares regression line fit to the resulting data. (Recall that density is defined as mass divided by volume.) Computer output for the regression analysis is shown below. (a) Since the process the engineer used to measure the mass of samples does not always provide the true density value, the regression model shown above contains a random error term. To use the t-distribution to perform a test of hypotheses or construct a confidence interval for the slope of the least-squares regression line, the random errors must conform to some model assumptions. These include the assumption that the random errors are independent of each other. In the context of this experiment, this means that the error that the engineer makes in measuring the mass of one sample has no influence on the error made in determining the density of any other sample. Describe two other assumptions about the distribution of the random errors that are needed to use the t-distribution to perform a test of hypotheses or construct a confidence interval for the slope of the least squares regression line. (b) Assuming that all of the assumptions that you considered in part (a) are satisfied, construct a 95 percent confidence interval for d, the true density of the material. With respect to the target density of 1.37 kg/mL, what conclusion can be reached? (c) In context, what does the intercept in the least squares regression line that is associated with the computer output above represent? (d) Use your answer from part (c) to explain why it might be reasonable to set the intercept equal to 0 and consider the resulting alternative model Mass = d*Volume + Error as a model for the true density of the material. The engineer fit a regression model with an intercept of 0 to the data from the nine samples and obtained the following results for the least squares estimate of the slope. The engineer then wanted to use the results to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope, but could not decide if it should be constructed as 1.3966 ± (2.306)(0.00469) or as 1.3966 ± (2.262)(0.00469). The first expression uses the critical value 2.306, the 97.5 percentile of a t-distribution with 8 degrees of freedom, and the second expression uses the critical value 2.262, the 97.5 percentile of a t-distribution with 9 degrees of freedom. The engineer decided to perform a simulation study to determine the appropriate formula to use to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope. (e) To perform the simulation study, the engineer will simulate samples of mass observations using the model Mass = 1.3966*Volume + Error for the nine volumes of material (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90) used in the study. The standard deviation of the random errors is assumed to be 0.7925. Explain how the engineer can simulate a sample of observations for the nine amounts using a computer program that can generate random samples from a standard normal distribution. (f) Given the method of simulating samples described in part (e), explain how the engineer can determine which of the two expressions provides an appropriate method of constructing a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of a least squares regression line, using a model with an intercept of 0.",
