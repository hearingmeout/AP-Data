Emma is moving to a large city and is investigating typical monthly rental prices of available one-bedroom apartments. She obtained a random sample of rental prices for 50 one-bedroom apartments taken from a Web site where people voluntarily list available apartments.

        "text": "(c) Instead of using the sample median as the point estimate for the population median, Emma wants to use an interval estimate. However, computing an interval estimate requires knowing the sampling distribution of the sample median for samples of size 50. Emma has one point, her sample median, in that sampling distribution. Using information about rental prices that are available on the Web site, describe how someone could develop a theoretical sampling distribution of the sample median for samples of size 50. Because Emma does not have the resources to develop the theoretical sampling distribution, she estimates the sampling distribution of the sample median using a process called bootstrapping. In the bootstrapping process, a computer program performs the following steps. Take a random sample, with replacement, of size 50 from the original sample. Calculate and record the median of the sample. Repeat the process to obtain a total of 15,000 medians. Emma ran the bootstrap process, and the following frequency table is the bootstrap distribution showing her results of generating 15,000 medians.
