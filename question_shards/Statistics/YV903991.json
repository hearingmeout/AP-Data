    "question": "A local employer asked for help selecting a new type of desk chair. Thirty employees volunteered, and each employee used the new desk chair for two weeks and the current desk chair for two weeks. To determine which chair was used first, a coin was flipped for each employee. Heads represented using the new chair first, and tails represented using the current chair first. At the end of each two-week period, the employees were asked to rate their satisfaction with the new chair. Which of the following best describes this study?",
