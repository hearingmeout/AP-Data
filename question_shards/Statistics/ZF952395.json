    "question": "To estimate the percent of red marbles in a large bag of marbles, Margo will use the following sampling method. She will randomly select a marble, record its color, put it back into the bag, shake the bag to thoroughly mix the marbles, and then repeat those steps. She will perform the procedure many times. What type of sampling method is Margo using?",
