    "question": "Directions: Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.During a flu vaccine shortage in the United States, it was believed that 45 percent of vaccine-eligible people received flu vaccine. The results of a survey given to a random sample of 2,350 vaccine-eligible people indicated that 978 of the 2,350 people had received flu vaccine.Construct a 99 percent confidence interval for the proportion of vaccine-eligible people who had received flu vaccine. Use your confidence interval to comment on the belief that 45 percent of the vaccine-eligible people had received flu vaccine.Suppose a similar survey will be given to vaccine-eligible people in Canada by Canadian health officials. A 99 percent confidence interval for the proportion of people who will have received flu vaccine is to be constructed. What is the smallest sample size that can be used to guarantee that the margin of error will be less than or equal to 0.02 ?",
