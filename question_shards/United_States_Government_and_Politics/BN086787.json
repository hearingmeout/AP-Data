Describe a structural barrier in the scenario that makes it less likely that a third-party candidate will be able to secure enough popular support to justify including the candidate in a debate. In the context of the scenario, explain how a third-party candidate could still have an influence on public policy despite the barrier described in part A. Explain how including the third-party candidate in the scenario could have had a positive impact on participatory democracy.",
