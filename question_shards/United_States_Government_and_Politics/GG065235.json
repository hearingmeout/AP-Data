    "question": "This question focuses on thesis development and the use of supporting evidence to help develop a student’s ability to respond effectively to FRQ 4-the Argument Essay. There are three points available. Read the prompt and directions carefully and use substantive examples appropriately in your response. Education plays a crucial role in providing opportunity for citizens and advancing American society. Most education policy is made at the state and local levels, which restricts the federal government's role in education to providing supplemental funding for educational programs. At some point, however, the federal government expanded its role by setting requirements for schools to meet certain standards in order to receive federal financial support. Using your knowledge of how federalism affects policy making, develop an argument on whether the federal government's role in education should be expanded. Use at least one piece of evidence from one of the following foundational documents: The Federalist 10 Brutus 1 Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution In your response, you should do the following: ✓ Respond to the prompt with a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. ✓ Support your claim or thesis with one piece of evidence that comes from one of the foundational documents listed above.",
