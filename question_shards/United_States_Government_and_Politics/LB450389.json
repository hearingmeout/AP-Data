CONGRESSIONAL HEARING DAYS IN THE HOUSE THAT INVESTIGATED THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, 1969–2014 Source: Data from Kriner and Schickler, 2016 Use the bar graph to answer the following questions. Using the bar graph, identify the president who faced the fewest number of investigative hearing days in a single year when the House was controlled by the opposing party. Describe the relationship between investigative hearing days and party control of the House and the presidency as shown in the bar graph. Draw a conclusion about how the difference in congressional hearing days between 1970–1980 and 1990–2000 may have affected presidential power during those periods. Explain whether the data in the bar graph for the years in which the president’s party controlled the House reflect Madison’s ideas in The Federalist 51.",
