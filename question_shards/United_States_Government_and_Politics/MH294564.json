    "question": "This question focuses on thesis development, the use of supporting evidence, and the application of reasoning to help develop a student’s ability to respond effectively to FRQ 4-the Argument Essay. There are five points available. Read the prompt and directions carefully and use substantive examples appropriately in your response. The Miranda rule requires that all suspects be informed of their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights before being interrogated about a crime. These rights include the right to remain silent and to request an attorney. If authorities fail to issue this warning to a suspect, statements made by the suspect to authorities cannot be used as evidence during a criminal trial. Develop an argument that takes a position on whether the failure to issue a Miranda warning should lead to information given by a suspect not being allowed as evidence in a criminal trial. Use at least one piece of evidence from one of the following foundational documents: Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution In your essay, you must: ✓ Respond to the prompt with a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. ✓ Support your claim with at least TWO pieces of specific and relevant evidence. One piece of evidence must come from one of the foundational documents listed above. A second piece of evidence can come from any other foundational document not used as your first piece of evidence, or it may be from your knowledge of course concepts. ✓ Use reasoning to explain why your evidence supports your claim/thesis.",
