    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question. In your response, use substantive examples where appropriate. The media’s coverage of congressional elections often focuses on which candidate is ahead in that day’s polling, which political scientists refer to as “horse-race coverage.” This type of news coverage tends to favor polling numbers and the drama of the campaign over substantive issues. Develop an argument as to whether horse-race coverage has had a positive or negative impact on Congressional campaigns. Use at least one piece of evidence from one of the following foundational documents: • The First Amendment • The Federalist 10 • Article I of the United States Constitution In your essay, you must: ✓ Respond to the prompt with a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. ✓ Support your claim with at least TWO pieces of specific and relevant evidence. o One piece of evidence must come from one of the foundational documents listed above. o A second piece of evidence can come from any other foundational document not used as your first piece of evidence, or it may be from your knowledge of course concepts. ✓ Use reasoning to explain why your evidence supports your claim/thesis. ✓ Respond to an opposing or alternative perspective using rebuttal or refutation.",
