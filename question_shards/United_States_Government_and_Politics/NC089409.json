    "question": "Respond to all parts of the question. In your response, use substantive examples where appropriate. In the early days of the country, presidential campaigns were conducted within a significantly shorter period of time. Today, it is common for potential presidential candidates to start campaigning shortly after the congressional midterms end, making the presidential campaign season a regular fixture in American political life. Develop an argument that explores whether longer presidential campaign seasons are helpful or harmful to American democracy. Use at least one piece of evidence from one of the following foundational documents: • The Federalist 70 • Brutus 1 • Article II of the United States Constitution In your essay, you must: ✓ Respond to the prompt with a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. ✓ Support your claim with at least TWO pieces of specific and relevant evidence. o One piece of evidence must come from one of the foundational documents listed above. o A second piece of evidence can come from any other foundational document not used as your first piece of evidence, or it may be from your knowledge of course concepts. ✓ Use reasoning to explain why your evidence supports your claim/thesis. ✓ Respond to an opposing or alternative perspective using rebuttal or refutation.",
