Referencing the scenario, describe the party control of government when Congress passed legislation in 2014 to repeal the ACA, and explain how that party control could have affected the attempt to repeal the ACA in 2014. Referencing the scenario, explain why a Republican representative following the delegate model of representation might have cast a vote in favor of the ACA bill in 2009 when it was originally passed. Describe how the judicial branch could be used to implement the Republican’s legislative goals despite President Obama’s veto.
