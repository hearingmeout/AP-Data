    "description": "Major Parties\n Third Parties\n\nA\n An important electoral function of the major parties is to sponsor primaries and caucuses during the nomination process.\n Third parties frequently displace one of the major parties in presidential elections and become a major party themselves.\n\nB\n The rules of the electoral college favor the major-party candidates in presidential elections.\n Winner-take-all voting districts hinder the electoral success of third-party candidates.\n\nC\n Major parties sometimes incorporate the issues promoted by third parties into the major-party platforms.\n Third parties usually receive public funding to finance their campaigns during presidential elections.\n\nD\n Presidential nominees of the major parties often choose a third-party member as a running mate to balance the ticket.\n Third-party candidates seldom experience electoral success, in part because voters do not believe they have a chance to win.",
