    "description": "“Any candidate using Facebook can put a campaign message promising one thing in front of one group of voters while simultaneously running an ad with a completely opposite message in front of a different group of voters. The ads themselves are not posted anywhere for the general public to see (this is what’s known as ‘dark advertising’), and chances are, no one will ever be the wiser.\nThat undermines the very idea of a ‘marketplace of ideas,’ says Ann Ravel, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who has long advocated stricter regulations on digital campaigning. ‘The way to have a robust democracy is for people to hear all these ideas and make decisions and discuss,” Ravel said. ‘With microtargeting, that is not happening.’”\nJulia Carrie Wong, \"'It Might Work Too Well:' the Dark Art of Political Advertising Online,\" The Guardian, March 19, 2018.",
