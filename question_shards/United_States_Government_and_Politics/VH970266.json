    "question": "The United States Supreme Court reviewed state-mandated racial segregation in public schools. The Court stated that the separate schools “involved have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other ‘tangible’ factors. Our decision, therefore, cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors [among the] schools involved in each of the cases. We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education.”\nWhich of the following rules or clauses did the Supreme Court use to address the issue of racial segregation in public schools?",
