In your response, use substantive examples where appropriate.In an effort to balance free speech rights with the need to create safe learning environments for a diverse group of students, some public universities have established free speech zones on their campuses. Within the zones students are permitted to protest, post signs, and engage freely in the expression of their opinions. Outside the zones, however, students are expected to avoid speech that could be seen as offensive or obscene. Many have criticized these zones for limiting free speech and have called into question the constitutionality of designated zones for free speech.Develop an argument either for or against the use of free speech zones on public college campuses.Use at least one piece of evidence from one of the following foundational documents:The First AmendmentThe Declaration of IndependenceIn your essay, you must:✓ Respond to the prompt with a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning.✓ Support your claim with at least TWO pieces of specific and relevant evidence.One piece of evidence must come from one of the foundational documents listed above.A second piece of evidence can come from any other foundational document not used as your first piece of evidence, or it may be from your knowledge of course concepts.✓ Use reasoning to explain why your evidence supports your claim/thesis.",
