    "description": "The following is from the 2016 Republican Party Platform.\n\n“Because the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions affect job creation, upward mobility for workers, and equitable prosperity, they should be transparent. Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner. The Republican Party will advance legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, and the Federal Reserve’s dealing with foreign banks.”",
    "question": "Respond to parts A, B, and C.\n\nReferencing the scenario, describe an action, other than advancing legislation, that members of Congress may take to bring transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn the context of this section of the Republican Party platform, explain how the action to increase transparency and accountability described in part A would affect the Federal Reserve’s ability to make economic policy.\n\nThe passage suggests that greater transparency in the Federal Reserve will help workers and create more equitable prosperity for average Americans. Suppose the Democratic Party wants to create a statement about helping workers and reducing inequality in their party platform. Explain how the ideological perspective of the Democratic Party would likely affect how it would address these economic issues.",
