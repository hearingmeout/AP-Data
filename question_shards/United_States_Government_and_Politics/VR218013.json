    "description": "In 1996, the Republican-controlled Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which was signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton. This legislation defined in federal law a “marriage” as “only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife,” and defined the word “spouse” to mean only “a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.”\n\nWhen Thea Spyer died in 2009, she left her estate to her wife, Edith Windsor. The couple married in Canada in 2007, and were recognized as legally married by the state of New York. However, since the two were not considered legally married for federal tax purposes due to DOMA, Edith Windsor was forced to pay a significant federal estate tax, which would not have applied to an opposite-sex married couple.\n\nEdith Windsor filed suit in a federal court, and the case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013. The Supreme Court ruled DOMA unconstitutional in United States v. Windsor (2013).",
