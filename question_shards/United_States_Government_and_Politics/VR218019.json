    "description": "Throughout his second term, President George W. Bush proposed initiatives aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the environment. Among President Bush’s proposals were issuing standards to decrease the amount of gasoline cars consume per mile and utilizing cleaner energy technologies.\n\nOn January 24, 2007, President Bush ordered bureaucratic agencies to reduce greenhouse gases through listing requirements such as sustainable environmental practices, including the purchase of bio-based, energy efficient, water efficient, and recycled content products, and buying electric or hybrid vehicles. Federal agencies would also need to ensure that at least half of current renewable energy would come from solar, wind, or other renewable sources.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, President Bush issued an order calling for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency to cooperate with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles “in a manner consistent with sound science, analysis of benefits and cost, public safety, and economic growth.” The intent of the order was to streamline bureaucratic implementation of environmental policy and foster cooperation between the agencies.",
