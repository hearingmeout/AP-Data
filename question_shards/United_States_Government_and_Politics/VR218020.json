    "description": "On October 26, 1987, Republican President Ronald Reagan issued an order expressing his desire “to restore the division of governmental responsibilities between the national government and the States that was intended by the Framers of the Constitution.” This order was issued to “guide the Executive departments and agencies in the formulation and implementation of policies. . . that [had] substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.”\n\nThe action by the president contained several directives to federal agencies. These directives included telling the agencies not to establish uniform national standards unless it was absolutely necessary and even then, to be sure and consult with the appropriate state officials in developing those standards. The president also told executive departments not to ask Congress for legislation that would regulate the states or override existing state laws if at all possible.",
