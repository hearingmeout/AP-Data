    "description": "This question requires you to compare a Supreme Court case you studied in class with one you have not studied in class. A summary of the Supreme Court case you did not study in class is presented below and provides all of the information you need to know about this case to answer the prompt.\n\nTimbs v. Indiana (2019)\n\nIn November of 2013, Tyson Timbs was arrested after selling illegal drugs to an undercover police officer. Timbs pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a year of house arrest, five years probation, and a $1,200 fine.\n\nIn addition, the state sought to seize Timbs’s Land Rover, which Timbs used to transport the illegal drugs. The Land Rover was previously purchased for $42,000. Timbs argued that the vehicle seizure constituted an excessive fine, which was a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The maximum fine for Timbs’s crime was $10,000, which was considerably less than the price Timbs paid for the Land Rover.\n\nIn the resulting case, Timbs v. Indiana (2019), the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Timbs. The opinion of the Court, authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, stated that the excessive fines clause is a provision that applies to the states. The Court found that the protection against excessive fines is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.\"",
