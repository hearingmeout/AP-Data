    "description": "“Finally, there are the legal and moral arguments. Health care is considered a human right in every other developed nation. By not providing Medicare to all Americans, the government is not providing equal protection under the law: those with Medicare have more protection against the devastating effects of illness and injury, get more help overcoming or living with disabilities, and are protected against financial ruin.\n\nPeople say that single-payer would cost too much. Not true.\n\nWe could provide health care for all our citizens for no more than we are currently spending on our very dysfunctional, fragmented and unfair system.\n\nHow is this possible? Currently almost half of every health care dollar is spent on something other than health care: profit for insurance companies; multi-million-dollar salaries of their CEOs; money spent on advertising, processing (and rejecting) claims; and creating mountains of paperwork and endless hassles for doctors and patients.”\n\nDr. Ann Toy, Marin Voice, August 27, 2018.",
