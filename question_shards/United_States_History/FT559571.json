    "question": "Directions: It is suggested that you spend 15 minutes reading the documents and 40 minutes writing your response. Note: You may begin writing your response before the reading period is over. Question 1 is based on the accompanying documents. The documents have been edited for the purpose of this exercise. In your response you should do the following. Thesis: Present a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion. Argument Development: Develop and support a cohesive argument that recognizes and accounts for historical complexity by explicitly illustrating relationships among historical evidence such as contradiction, corroboration, and/or qualification. Use of the Documents: Utilize the content of at least six of the documents to support the stated thesis or a relevant argument. Sourcing the Documents: Explain the significance of the author’s point of view, author’s purpose, historical context, and/or audience for at least four documents. Contextualization: Situate the argument by explaining the broader historical events, developments, or processes immediately relevant to the question. Outside Evidence: Provide an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond those found in the documents to support or qualify the argument. Synthesis: Extend the argument by explaining the connections between the argument and ONE of the following. A development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographical area. A course theme and/or approach to history that is not the focus of the essay (such as political, economic, social, cultural, or intellectual history). Explain the causes of the rise of a women’s rights movement in the period 1940–1975.",
