    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“The Americas were discovered in 1492, and the first Christian settlements established by the Spanish the following year.... [I]t would seem... that the Almighty selected this part of the world as home to the greater part of the human race.... [T]heir delicate constitutions make them unable to withstand hard work or suffering and render them liable to succumb to almost any illness, no matter how mild. . . . It was upon these gentle lambs... that, from the very first day they clapped eyes on them, the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. . . . The native population, which once numbered some five hundred thousand, was wiped out by forcible expatriation to the island of Hispaniola.”\n\nBartolomé de Las Casas, 1552",
