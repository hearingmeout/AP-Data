    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“Few historians would dispute that the market revolution brought substantial material benefits to most northeasterners, urban and rural.... Those who benefited most from the market revolution—merchants and manufacturers, lawyers and other professionals, and successful commercial farmers, along with their families—faced life situations very different from those known to earlier generations. The decline of the household as the locus of production led directly to a growing impersonality in the economic realm; household heads, instead of directing family enterprises or small shops, often had to find ways to recruit and discipline a wage-labor force; in all cases, they had to stay abreast of or even surpass their competitors.”\n\nSean Wilentz, historian, “Society, Politics, and the Market Revolution, 1815–1848,” published in 1997",
