    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“Slavery, though imposed and maintained by violence, was a negotiated relationship.... First, even as they confronted one another, master and slave had to concede, however grudgingly, a degree of legitimacy to the other.... [T]he web of interconnections between master and slave necessitated a coexistence that fostered cooperation as well as contestation. Second, because the circumstances of such contestation and cooperation continually changed, slavery itself continually changed. . . . Slavery was never made, but instead was continually remade, for power—no matter how great—was never absolute, but always contingent.”\n\nIra Berlin, historian, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America, 1998",
