    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“The Republican electoral triumph in 2004 was the culmination of a half-century of struggle by the Right to achieve political power in the United States. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, a small band of intellectuals launched a movement to stop what they saw as the advance of the collectivist state embodied in modern liberalism and the New Deal political order. They were joined by anti-Communist activists across grassroots America. . . . In their struggle against the dominant liberal state, conservatives gained control of the Republican party by defeating its liberal eastern wing.”\n\nDonald T. Critchlow, historian, The Conservative Ascendancy: How the GOP Right Made Political History, 2007",
