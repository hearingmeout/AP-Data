    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“In colonial New England, two sets of human communities which were also two sets of ecological relationships confronted each other, one Indian and one European. They rapidly came to inhabit a single world, but in the process the landscape of New England was so transformed that the Indians’ earlier way of interacting with the environment became impossible. The task before us is not only to describe the ecological changes that took place in New England but to determine what it was about Indians and colonists—in their relations both to nature and to each other—that brought those changes about.”\n\nWilliam Cronon, historian, Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England, 1983",
