    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“As [political leader Henry] Clay envisioned it [in the 1820s], the American System constituted the... basis for social improvement.... Through sale of its enormous land holdings, the federal government could well afford to subsidize internal improvements. By levying protective tariffs, the government should foster the development of American manufacturing and agricultural enterprises that, in their infancy, might not be able to withstand foreign competition. The promotion of industry would create a home market for agricultural commodities, just as farms provided a market for manufactured products.”\n\nDaniel Walker Howe, historian, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848, published in 2007",
