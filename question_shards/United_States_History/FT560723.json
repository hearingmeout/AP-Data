    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below.\n\nWomen’s libbers do not speak for the majority of American women. American women do not want to be liberated from husbands and children. We do not want to trade our birthright of the special privileges of American women—for the mess of pottage called the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n“Modern technology and opportunity have not discovered any nobler or more satisfying or more creative career for a woman than marriage and motherhood. The wonderful advantage that American women have is that we can have all the rewards of that number-one career, and still moonlight with a second one to suit our intellectual, cultural, or financial tastes or needs.”\n\nPhyllis Schlafly, “What’s Wrong with ‘Equal Rights’ for Women?,” 1972",
    "question": "The ideas expressed in the excerpt are most closely aligned with which of the following broader historical developments?",
