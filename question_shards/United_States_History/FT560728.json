    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“[S]ince a report had been made to the king on the fertility of the soil by [Sieur de Monts] and by me on the feasibility of discovering the passage to China, . . . his Majesty directed Sieur de Monts to make a new outfit, and send men to continue what he had commenced. . . . He was also influenced by the hope of greater advantages in case of settling in the interior, where the people are civilized,... than along the sea-shore, where the [natives] generally dwell. From this course, he believed the king would derive an inestimable profit; for it is easy to suppose that Europeans will seek out this advantage rather than those of a jealous and intractable disposition to be found on the shores.”\n\nSamuel de Champlain, French explorer, 1604",
