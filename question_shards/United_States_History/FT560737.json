    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“All the fresh air that ever enters these stairs comes from the hall-door that is forever slamming, and from the windows of dark bedrooms that in turn receive from the stairs their sole supply of the elements God meant to be free.... The sinks are in the hallway, that all the tenants may have access—and all be poisoned alike by their summer stenches.... When the summer heats come with their suffering they have meaning more terrible than words can tell.... This gap between dingy brick-walls is the yard. That strip of smoke-colored sky up there is the heaven of these people.... A hundred thousand people lived in... tenements in New York last year.”\n\nJacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890",
