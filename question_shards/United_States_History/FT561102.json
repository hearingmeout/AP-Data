    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below. \n\n“We have conquered many of the neighboring tribes of Indians, but we have never thought of holding them in subjection—never of incorporating them into our Union....To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes.... Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... [I]t is professed and talked about to erect these Mexicans into a Territorial Government, and place them on an equality with the people of the United States. I protest utterly against such a project.”\n\nSenator John C. Calhoun, “Conquest of Mexico” speech, 1848",
