    "question": "Directions: The following question requires you to construct a coherent essay that integrates your interpretation of Documents A-I and your knowledge of the period referred to in the question. High scores will be earned only by essays that both cite key pieces of evidence from the documents and draw on outside knowledge of the period. In your response you should do the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents. Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt. For at least three documents, explain how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument. Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt. The 1920s have been characterized as a decade of economic, social, and cultural change. Analyze the extent to which the First World War and consumerism affected United States society during this period.",
