    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below.\n\n“What induced [American] Indians to go out of their way to trap beaver and trade the skins for glass beads, mirrors, copper kettles, and other goods?... Recent scholarship on [American] Indians’ motives in this earliest stage of the trade indicates that they regarded such objects as the equivalents of the quartz, mica, shell, and other sacred substances that had formed the heart of long-distance exchange in North America for millennia.... While northeastern [American] Indians recognized Europeans as different from themselves, they interacted with them and their materials in ways that were consistent with their own customs and beliefs.”\n\nNeal Salisbury, historian, “The Indians’ Old World: Native Americans and the Coming of Europeans,” 1996",
