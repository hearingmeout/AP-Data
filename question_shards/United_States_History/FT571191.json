Of course, I say to all who are in want of work, GoWest! . . .\n\n“On the whole I say, stay where you are; do as well as you can; and devote every spare hour to making yourself familiar with the conditions and dexterity required for the efficient conservation of out-door industry in a new country. Having mastered these, gather up your family and GoWest!”\n\nHorace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, letter to R. L. Sanderson, 1871",
