    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below.\n\n“The remedy for... inefficiency lies in systematic management.... The fundamental principles of scientific management are applicable to all kinds of human activities, from our simplest individual acts to the work of our great corporations.... At the works of Bethlehem Steel, for example,... thousands of stop-watch observations were made to study just how quickly a laborer... can push his shovel into the pile of materials and then draw it out properly loaded.... With data of this sort before him, . . . the man who is directing shovelers can first teach them the exact methods which should be employed to use their strength to the very best advantage.”\n\nFrederick Winslow Taylor, The Principles of Scientiﬁc Management, 1911",
