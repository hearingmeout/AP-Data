    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below.\n\n“Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.\n\n“Reaction to last summer’s disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division. . . .\n\n“Segregation and poverty have created in the racial ghetto a destructive environment totally unknown to most white Americans.\n\n“What white Americans have never fully understood—but what the Negro can never forget—is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\n\n“It is time now to turn with all the purpose at our command to the major unfinished business of this nation.\n\n. . . It is time to make good the promises of American democracy to all citizens.”\n\nReport of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, also known as the Kerner Commission, 1968",
