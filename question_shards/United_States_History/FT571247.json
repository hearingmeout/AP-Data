    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below.\n\n“It’s been quite a journey this decade, and we held together through some stormy seas. And at the end, together, we’re reaching our destination. The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits, from the recession of ’81 to ’82, to the expansion that began in late ’82 and continues to this day, we’ve made a difference. The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I’m proudest of. One is the economic recovery, in which the people of America created—and filled—nineteen million new jobs. The other is the recovery of our morale. America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership.”\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan, Farewell Address to the Nation, January 1989",
