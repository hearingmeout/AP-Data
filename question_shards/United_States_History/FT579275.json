    "description": "Question refers to the excerpt below.\n\n“Various are the reports and conjectures of the causes of the present Indian war. Some impute it to an imprudent zeal in the magistrates of Boston to christianize those heathen before they were civilized and enjoining them the strict observation of their laws.... Some believe there have been vagrant and Jesuitical priests, who have made it their business, for some years past, to go from Sachem to Sachem, to exasperate the Indians against the English and to bring them into a confederacy, and that they were promised supplies from France and other parts to extirpate [eradicate] the English nation out of the continent of America.”\n\nEdward Randolph, report of King Philip’s War (Metacom’s War) in New England, 1676",
