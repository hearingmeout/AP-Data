They therefore humbly beseech your honors to give this petition its due weight and consideration and cause an act of the legislature to be passed whereby they may be restored to the enjoyments of that which is the natural right of all men.”\n\nPetition for freedom to the Massachusetts Council and the House of Representatives for the State of Massachusetts, January 1777",
