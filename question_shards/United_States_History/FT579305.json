    "description": "“In August 1865, the photographer Marcus Ormsbee... took a formal portrait of several groups of craft workers in their different shops.... At the center of the photograph, at Outcault’s carpentry shop, stands the conventional artisan trio of master, journeyman, and apprentice, still at the heart of the city’s workshop world—yet class differences mark these craftsmen’s every feature.... Brooding above everyone, a new brick manufactory seals off its employees from the street and from public view. Small shop and large enterprise converge; New York remains a blend of old and new.”\n\nSean Wilentz, historian, Chants Democratic, 1984",
