    "description": "“Beginning in the 1930s and lasting into the 1940s, black Chicago experienced a cultural renaissance.... Chicago had become a major destination for black southern migrants.... It was also an urban industrial center. This fact gave a unique working-class and internationalist perspective to the cultural work that would take place there....\n\n“A desire to live freely in ‘the metropolis’ continued to characterize the aspirations of migrants as second-wave Chicago migrants arrived.... The 1930s and 1940s witnessed a resurgence of black working-class political radicalism that was captured and reflected in the expressive visual and literary productions of Chicago Black Renaissance artists.”\n\nDarlene Clark Hine, historian, The Black Chicago Renaissance, 2012",
