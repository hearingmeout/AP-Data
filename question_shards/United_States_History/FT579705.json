    "description": "“[After the Second World War, Americans] wanted...a secure country. Security would enable them to take advantage of the fruits of prosperity and peace.... And so they adhered to an overarching principle that would guide them in their personal and political lives: containment.... Domestic containment was bolstered by a powerful political culture that rewarded its adherents and marginalized its detractors.... [C]ontainment aptly describes the way in which public policy, personal behavior, and even political values were focused on the home.... Vast numbers of American women and men during the early years of the cold war...got married, moved to the suburbs, and had babies.... [Few] were willing to give up the rewards of conforming for the risks of resisting the domestic path.”\n\nElaine Tyler May, historian, Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era, 1988",
