    "description": "\"We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities.... Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people—these American values we found good.... As we grew,however,our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss.... The declaration ‘all men are created equal’ rang hollow before the facts of Negro life.... The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.... America rests in national stalemate,...its democratic system apathetic and manipulated rather than ‘of, by, and for the people.’”\n\nStudents for a Democratic Society, “The Port Huron Statement,” 1962",
