It is certainly in the interest of all, and I am convinced it is the desire of every one of us, to treat our slaves with proper kindness.”\n\n— Letter from former South Carolina governor James Henry Hammond, 1845\n\n“Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of Liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and denounce ... slavery ‘the great sin and shame of America’!”\n\n— Frederick Douglass, speech titled “The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro,” 1852",
