    "description": "“Mr. Jay’s treaty [which reestablished trade and diplomatic relations between the United States and Great Britain following the Revolutionary War] has at length been made public. So general a burst of dissatisfaction never before appeared against any transaction. Those who understand the particular articles of it, condemn these articles.

This last is the most numerous class, comprehending the whole body of the people, who have taken a greater interest in this transaction than they were ever known to do in any other. It has in my opinion completely demolished the monarchical party here.”\n\nThomas Jefferson, letter to James Monroe, September 6, 1795",
