    "description": "“The Vigilance Committee of Boston inform you that the MOCK TRIAL of the poor Fugitive Slave has been further postponed....\n\nCome down, then, Sons of the Puritans: for even if the poor victim is to be carried off by the brute force of arms, and delivered over to Slavery, you should at least be present to witness the sacrifice, and you should follow him in sad procession with your tears and prayers, and then go home and take such action as your manhood and your patriotism may suggest.\n\nCome, then, by the early trains on MONDAY, and rally.... Come with courage and resolution in your hearts; but, this time, with only such arms as God gave you.”\n\nProclamation addressed “To the Yeomanry of New England,” Boston, 1854",
