    "description": "“We are the people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.\n\n“When we were kids, the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations....\n\n“As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss....\n\n“The conventional moral terms of the age, the politician moralities—‘free world,’ ‘people’s democracies’ reflect realities poorly, if at all, and seem to function more as ruling myths than as descriptive principles....\n\n“The bridge to political power, though, will be built through genuine cooperation, locally, nationally, and internationally, between a new left of young people, and an awakening community of allies.”\n\nStudents for a Democratic Society (SDS), Port Huron Statement, 1962",
