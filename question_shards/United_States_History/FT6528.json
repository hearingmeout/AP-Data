    "description": "“In 1680 Pueblo leaders united most of their communities against the European intruders....In a matter of weeks, the Pueblos had eliminated Spaniards from New Mexico above El Paso. The natives had killed over 400 of the province’s 2,500 foreigners, destroyed or sacked every Spanish building, and laid waste to the Spaniards’ fields. There could be no mistaking the deep animosity that some natives, men as well as their influential wives and mothers, held toward their former oppressors.... Some Pueblo leaders...urged an end to all things Spanish as well as Christian. After the fighting subsided, they counselled against speaking Castilian or planting crops introduced by the Europeans.”\n\nDavid J. Weber, historian, The Spanish Frontier in North America, 1992",
