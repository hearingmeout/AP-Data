    "description": "“The Declaration of Independence, drawn up by the Continental Congress, was actually a declaration by ‘thirteen united States of America’ proclaiming that as ‘Free and Independent States they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of right do.’ And the Articles of Confederation, for all the powers it theoretically gave to the Congress, did not in fact alter this independence. . . . Congressional resolutions continued to be mere recommendations which the states were left to enforce. . . . The Confederation was intended to be, and remained, a Confederation of sovereign states.”\nGordon S. Wood, historian, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776–1787, published in 1969",
