    "description": "“Today, two hundred and fifty years after the French and Indian War, most Americans are no more familiar with its events and significance than they are with those of the Peloponnesian War. Few know that George Washington struck the first spark of a war that set the British North American frontier ablaze from the Carolinas to Nova Scotia, then spread to Europe, Canada, the Caribbean, West Africa, India, and, finally, the Philippines. Historians call this immense conflict the Seven Years’ War; . . . Winston Churchill described it as ‘the first world war.’”\nFred Anderson, The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War, 2005",
