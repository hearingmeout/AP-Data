Happy Land!\n Hail ye heroes, heaven-born band,\n Who fought and bled in freedom’s cause,\n Who fought and bled in freedom’s cause,\n And when the storm of war was gone,\n Enjoy’d the peace your valor won—\n Let Independence be our boast,\n Ever mindful what it cost;\n Ever grateful for the prize,\n Let its altar reach the skies.\n\nFirm, united let us be,\n Rallying round our Liberty,\n As a band of brothers join’d,\n Peace and safety we shall find. . . .\n\nSound, sound the trump of fame,\n Let [George] Washington’s great name\n Ring round the world with loud applause,\n Ring round the world with loud applause,\n Let every clime to freedom dear,\n Listen with a joyful ear,\n With equal skill, with godlike power,\n He governs in the fearful hour\n Of horrid war, or guides with ease,\n The happier times of honest peace.\n\nFirm, united let us be,\n Rallying round our Liberty,\n As a band of brothers join’d,\n Peace and safety we shall find.\n\nHail Columbia, popular song, 1798",
