    "description": "“From infancy I was taught to love humanity and liberty. Inquiry and experience have since confirmed my reverence for the lessons then given me, by convincing me more fully of their truth and excellence. Benevolence towards mankind excites wishes for their welfare, and such wishes endear the means of fulfilling them. Those can be found in liberty alone, and therefore her sacred cause ought to be espoused by every man, on every occasion, to the utmost of his power. . . .\n“These being my sentiments, I am encouraged to offer you, my countrymen, my thoughts on some late transactions, that in my opinion are of the utmost importance to you. . . .\n“If the BRITISH PARLIAMENT has a legal authority to order, that we shall furnish a single article for the troops here, and to compel obedience to that order; they have the same right to order us to supply those troops with arms, clothes, and . . . to compel obedience to that order also. . . . What is this but taxing us at a certain sum, and leaving to us only the manner of raising it? How is this mode more tolerable than the STAMP ACT?”\nJohn Dickinson, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies, 1768",
