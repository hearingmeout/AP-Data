    "description": "“I am forty-nine years old. It took me years of considerable anguish to get where I am. . . . I was nurtured in the Depression; I lost four years to war; I have had one coronary; I am a ‘liberal,’ a square and a professor of history.\n“As such, I am supposed to have ‘liaison’ with the young. But the fact is that I am fed up with hippies, Yippies, militants and nonsense. . . .\n“Every generation makes mistakes, always has and always will. We have made our share. But my generation has made America the most affluent country on earth; it has tackled, head-on, a racial problem which no nation on earth in the history of mankind had dared to do. It has publicly declared war on poverty and it has gone to the moon; it has desegregated schools and abolished polio. . . .\n“I assert that we are [in] trouble with this younger generation not because we have failed our country, not because of affluence or stupidity, . . . not because we are middle-class materialists, but simply because we have failed to keep that generation in its place. . . .\n“To the extent that we now rely on the police, mace, the National Guard, tear gas, steel fences and a wringing of hands, we will fail. What we need is a reappraisal of our own middle-class selves, our worth and our hard-won progress. We need to use disdain, not mace; we need to reassess a weapon we came by the hard way—firm authority as parents, teachers, businessmen, workers and politicians.”\nK.
