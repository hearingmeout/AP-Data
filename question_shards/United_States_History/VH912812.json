    "description": "“Both the phrase ‘Great Society’ and the planning for it dated to May 1964, when [President Lyndon] Johnson addressed the graduating class of the University of Michigan. ‘We have the opportunity,’ he proclaimed, ‘to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.’ . . . Starting in that summer [of 1964] he also established the first of what ultimately became 135 ‘task forces’ to study a wide range of social problems. . . . Much of what he requested aimed to go beyond . . . the New Deal in order to create a Great Society that would be qualitatively better and that would guarantee ‘rights’ and government entitlements.”\nJames T. Patterson, Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974, published in 1996",
