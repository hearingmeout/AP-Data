    "description": "“Brothers, We tell you that we seek not war, we ask nothing better than to be quiet, and it depends, Brothers, only on you English, to have peace with us.\n“We have not yet sold the lands we inhabit, [and] we wish to keep the possession of them. Our elders have been willing to tolerate you, brothers Englishmen, on the seaboard. . . . But we will not cede one single inch of the lands we inhabit beyond what has been decided formerly by our fathers.\n“[The governor of French Canada] who is here present has nothing to do with what we say to you; we speak to you of our own accord, and in the name of all our allies. . . . We are entirely free; we are allies of the King of France, from whom we have received the Faith and all sorts of assistance in our necessities; we love that Monarch, and we are strongly attached to his interests.”\nAteawanto, Abenaki Indian leader, speech delivered to a representative of the royal governor of Massachusetts at a treaty conference between the Abenaki of present-day Maine, the Iroquois Indians of present-day New York, the French, and the English, 1752",
