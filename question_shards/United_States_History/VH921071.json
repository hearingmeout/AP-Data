    "description": "“Not far from this time Nat Turner’s insurrection [a slave rebellion] broke out; and the news threw our town into great commotion. . . .\n“It was always the custom to have a muster every year. On that occasion every White man shouldered his musket. The citizens and the so-called country gentlemen wore military uniforms. . . .\n“I knew the houses were to be searched; and I expected it would be done by country bullies and the poor Whites. . . .\n“It was a grand opportunity for the low Whites, who had no Negroes of their own to scourge. They exulted in such a chance to exercise a little brief authority, and show their subserviency to the slaveholders; not reflecting that the power which trampled on the colored people also kept themselves in poverty, ignorance, and moral degradation. . . . Colored people and slaves who lived in remote parts of the town suffered in an especial manner. In some cases the searchers scattered [gun]powder and shot among their clothes, and then sent other parties to find them, and bring them forward as proof that they were plotting insurrection.”\nHarriet Ann Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, published in 1861, describing events earlier in the nineteenth century",
