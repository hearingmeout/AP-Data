    "description": "“The development of a plantation economy, beginning in the sixteenth century, transformed Africa, America, Europe, and Asia, too. It displaced the old silk trade and shifted the increasingly dynamic center of the world economy westward to the Atlantic. . . .\n“The Atlantic economy supplied eager European consumers with mildly addictive . . . crops like tobacco and coffee, along with sugar. . . . The Atlantic plantation system transformed these three [products] into items of general consumption. . . . Investors prospered, and capital for further economic development accumulated in the [home country]. The governments found funding and motive to develop sea power. The Americas had lucrative export crops and developed a society based on a system of labor exploitation of Africans, and Africa suffered the transport of eleven million of its people to the New World.”\nThomas Bender, historian, A Nation Among Nations: America’s Place in World History, 2006",
