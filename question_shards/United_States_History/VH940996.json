    "description": "“[In Virginia] the Negroes live in small cottages called quarters . . . under the direction of an overseer, who takes care that they tend such land as the owner allots and orders. . . . Their greatest hardship [is] consisting in that they and their posterity are not at their own liberty or disposal, but the property of their owners. . . . The children belong to the master of the woman that bears them. . . .\n“[The] abundance of [the] English entertain . . . that they are all fools and beggars that live in any [other] country but theirs. This home fondness has been very prejudicial [harmful] to the common sort of English, and has in a great measure [slowed] the plantations from being stocked with such inhabitants as are skillful, industrious, and laborious. . . .\n“These [English] servants are but an insignificant number, when compared with the vast shoals [mass] of Negroes who are employed as slaves there to do the hardest and most part of the work.”\nHugh Jones, The Present State of Virginia, 1724",
