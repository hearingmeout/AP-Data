And I soon heard he was [to] come to New York and [New Jersey] and great multitudes [began] flocking after him under great concern for their souls which brought on my concern more and more hoping soon to see him. . . .\n“Then one morning all of a sudden, about 8 or 9 o'clock there came a messenger and said Mr. Whitefield . . . is to preach at Middletown this morning. . . . I was in my field at work. I dropped my tool that I had in my hand and ran home and . . . bade my wife get ready quick to go and hear Mr. Whitefield preach at Middletown, and [ran] to my pasture for my horse with all my might, fearing that I should be too late to hear him.\n“. . . . When we got to the old meeting house there was a great multitude; it was said to be 3 or 4,000 . . . people assembled together. . . .\n“When I saw Mr. Whitefield . . . he looked almost angelical . . . and my hearing how God was with him everywhere as he came along it solemnized my mind, and put me into a trembling fear before he began to preach . . . and my old foundation was broken up, and I saw that my righteousness would not save me. . . .”\nNathan Cole, farmer, describing going to hear Reverend George Whitefield preach in Middletown, Connecticut, 1740",
