    "description": "“Why is it that the middle class has a monopoly of the real enjoyment in Chicago? . . .\n“Theoretically, at least, there are no classes in Chicago. But the ‘middle class’ means all those people who are respectably in the background, who work either with hand or brain, who are neither poverty-stricken nor offensively rich, and who are not held down by the arbitrary laws governing that mysterious part of the community known as society. . . .\n“It is quite a privilege to belong to the middle class, especially during the warm weather in June. A middle-class family may sit on the front stoop all evening and watch the society people go to the weddings in their closed carriages. Father doesn’t have to wear a tight dress coat all evening and have a collar choking him. . . .\n“In Lincoln Park . . . the young man who drives the delivery wagon sits of an evening and holds the hand of the young woman who addresses letters. They are very happy, as well they may be, for no Chicago millionaire has such a magnificent front yard, with such a large lake and so many stately trees around it. They must feel sorry for the millionaire, who cannot go to a public park in the evening to stroll or sit. . . . It doesn’t trouble the delivery boy to have other people present and enjoying themselves.”\nGeorge Ade, journalist, “The Advantage of Being ‘Middle Class,’” Chicago Record, 1890",
