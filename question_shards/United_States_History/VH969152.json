    "description": "“Most Populists sought economic and political reform, not the overthrow of existing systems. . . . The ethos of modernity and progress swept across the cultural landscape of late nineteenth-century America, driven by the winds of commercial capitalism. The Populists mainly shared this ethos. . . . A firm belief in progress gave them confidence to act. Because they believed in the transforming power of science and technology, they sought to attain expertise and knowledge for their own improvement. Because they believed in economies of scale, they strove to adapt the model of large-scale enterprise to their own needs. . . . Because they believed in the logic of modernity, the Populist[s] . . . attempted to fashion an alternative modernity. . . .\n“. . . The demands of [Populist] farmers for currency inflation . . . threatened the dogmas and profits of bankers and creditors. . . . The capitalist elite pursued a corporate power that left little room for the organized power of men and women of the fields, mines, or factories. Their corporate vision clashed with the Populist vision of an alternative capitalism.”\nCharles Postel, historian, The Populist Vision, 2007",
