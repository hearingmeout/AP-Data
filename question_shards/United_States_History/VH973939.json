    "description": "“We are once again having one of those big troop debates: Do we send more forces to Afghanistan, and are we ready to do what it takes to ‘win’ there? This argument will be framed in many ways . . . : ‘toughness,’ ‘grit,’ ‘fortitude,’ ‘willingness to do whatever it takes to realize big stakes.’ . . .\n“But are we really that tough? If the metric is a willingness to send troops to Iraq and Afghanistan . . . , the answer is yes. . . . But in another way—when it comes to doing things that would actually weaken the people we are sending our boys and girls to fight—we are total wimps.\n“How so? . . . In 1973, Denmark got all its oil from the Middle East. Today? Zero. Why? Because Denmark got tough. It imposed on itself a carbon tax, a roughly $5-a-gallon gasoline tax, made massive investments in energy efficiency and in systems to generate energy from waste, along with a discovery of North Sea oil [near Europe]. . . .\n“According to [one] energy economist . . . , a $1 tax on gasoline and diesel fuel would raise about $140 billion a year. . . .\n“Such a tax would make our economy healthier by reducing the deficit, by stimulating the renewable energy industry. . . . Such a tax would make our population healthier by expanding health care and reducing [carbon] emissions. Such a tax would make our national-security healthier by shrinking our dependence on oil from [other] countries.”\nThomas Friedman, journalist, “Real Men Tax Gas,” The New York Times, 2009.
