    "description": "“As its preamble promised, the Constitution would ‘ensure domestic tranquility’ by allowing the federal government to field an army powerful enough to suppress rebellions like those that had flared up in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states. Even more important, the Constitution would ‘establish justice’ by preventing the state assemblies from adopting relief measures that screened their citizens from either their Continental taxes or their private debts. . . . Excoriating [harshly criticizing] the legislatures for collecting too little money from taxpayers, the bondholders and their sympathizers noted with approval that the Constitution would take the business of collecting federal taxes away from the states and place it firmly in the hands of a powerful new national government.”\nWoody Holton, historian, “‘From the Labours of Others’: The War Bonds Controversy and the Origins of the Constitution in New England,” William and Mary Quarterly, 2004",
