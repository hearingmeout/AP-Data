    "description": "“In 1789 the flag of the Republic waved over 4,000,000 souls in thirteen states, and their savage territory which stretched to the Mississippi, to Canada, to the Floridas. The timid minds of that day said that no new territory was needed; and, for the hour, they were right. But [Thomas] Jefferson, through whose intellect the centuries marched; Jefferson, who dreamed of Cuba as an American state; Jefferson, the first Imperialist of the Republic—Jefferson acquired that imperial territory which swept from the Mississippi to the mountains, from Texas to the British possessions, and the march of the flag began! . . . Jefferson, strict constructionist of constitutional power though he was, obeyed the Anglo-Saxon impulse within him. . . . And now obeying the same voice that Jefferson heard and obeyed, that [Andrew] Jackson heard and obeyed, that [James] Monroe heard and obeyed, that [William] Seward heard and obeyed, that [Ulysses] Grant heard and obeyed, that [Benjamin] Harrison heard and obeyed, our President today plants the flag over the islands of the seas, outposts of commerce, citadels of national security, and the march of the flag goes on!”\nAlbert J. Beveridge, candidate for United States Senate, “The March of the Flag” speech, 1898",
