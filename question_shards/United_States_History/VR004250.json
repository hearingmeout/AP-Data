    "description": "“To turn the administration of our civic affairs wholly over to men may mean that the American city will continue to push forward in its commercial and industrial development, and continue to lag behind in those things which make a city healthful and beautiful. . . . If women have in any sense been responsible for the gentler side of life which softens and blurs some of its harsher conditions, may they not have a duty to perform in our American cities? . . . [I]f woman would fulfill her traditional responsibility to her own children; if she would educate and protect from danger factory children who must find their recreation on the street . . . then she must bring herself to the use of the ballot—that latest implement for self-government.”\nJane Addams, “Why Women Should Vote,” Ladies’ Home Journal, 1910",
