[I]f woman would fulfill her traditional responsibility to her own children; if she would educate and protect from danger factory children who must find their recreation on the street . . . then she must bring herself to the use of the ballot—that latest implement for self-government.”\nJane Addams, “Why Women Should Vote,” Ladies’ Home Journal, 1910",
