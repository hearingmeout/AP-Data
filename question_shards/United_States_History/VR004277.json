    "description": "“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\n“We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
