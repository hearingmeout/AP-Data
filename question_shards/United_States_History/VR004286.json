    "description": "“No thoughtful person can question that the American economic system is under broad attack. This varies in scope, intensity, in the techniques employed, and in the level of visibility.\n“There always have been some who opposed the American system. . . .\n“But what now concerns us is quite new in the history of America. We are not dealing with sporadic or isolated attacks from a relatively few extremists or even from the minority socialist cadre. Rather, the assault on the enterprise system is broadly based and consistently pursued. . . .\n“The most disquieting voices joining the chorus of criticism come from perfectly respectable elements of society: from the college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual and literary journals, the arts and sciences, and from politicians.”\nMemorandum from Lewis F. Powell, Jr., attorney and future United States Supreme Court Justice, to Eugene B. Sydnor of the United States Chamber of Commerce, 1971",
