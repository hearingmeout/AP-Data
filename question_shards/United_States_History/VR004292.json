    "description": "“The Moral Majority, Christian Voice, and other groups of the 1970s and 1980s had a far broader issue agenda than their predecessors. The core agenda involved opposition to abortion, civil rights protection for gays and lesbians, and the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, which would have guaranteed equal rights for women], and support for school prayer and tuition tax credits for religious schools. But the organizations staked positions on a variety of other issues as well. [Jerry] Falwell . . . consistently supported increases in defense spending. The Moral Majority Report, the organization’s newsletter, attempted to build support for conservative economic issues as well, including a subminimum wage, a return to the gold standard, and cuts in social welfare spending.”\nClyde Wilcox, historian, 2003",
