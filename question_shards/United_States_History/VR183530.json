    "description": "“Probably no other individual [than Cornelius Vanderbilt, 1794–1877] made an equal impact over such an extended period on America’s economy and society. . . . He vastly improved and expanded the nation’s transportation infrastructure, contributing to a transformation of the very geography of the United States. . . . Far ahead of many of his peers, he grasped one of the great changes in American culture: the abstraction of economic reality, as the connection faded between the tangible world and the new devices of business, such as paper currency, corporations, and securities. . . . One person cannot move the national economy single-handedly—but no one else kept his hands on the lever for so long or pushed so hard.”\nT. J. Stiles, historian, The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt, 2009",
