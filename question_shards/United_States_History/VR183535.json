    "description": "“The slaves in the United States are treated with barbarous inhumanity; . . . they are overworked, underfed, wretchedly clad and lodged, and have insufficient sleep. . . . They are often kept confined in the stocks day and night for weeks together.”\nTheodore Dwight Weld, Slavery As It Is, published in New York, 1839\n\n“Slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the freest people in the world. . . . They enjoy liberty because they are oppressed by neither care nor labor. . . . The women do little hard work. . . . Men and stout boys work, on the average, in good weather, not more than nine hours a day.”\nGeorge Fitzhugh, Slaves Without Masters, published in Richmond, Virginia, 1857",
    "question": "Those who agreed with the views expressed in the excerpt by Weld would most likely have supported which of the following subsequent developments?",
