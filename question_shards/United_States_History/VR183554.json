    "description": "“We are just now making a great pretense of anxiety to civilize the [American] Indians. . . . As we have taken into our national family seven millions of Negroes . . . it would seem that the time may have arrived when we can very properly make at least the attempt to assimilate our two hundred and fifty thousand Indians. . . .\n“The school at Carlisle is an attempt on the part of the government to do this. . . . Carlisle fills young Indians with the spirit of loyalty to the stars and stripes, and then moves them out into our communities to show by their conduct and ability that the Indian is no different from the white or the colored, that he has the inalienable right to liberty and opportunity that the white and the negro have.”\nRichard H. Pratt, founder, Carlisle Indian Industrial School, “The Advantages of Mingling Indians with Whites,” 1892",
