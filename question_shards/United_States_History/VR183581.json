    "description": "“I believe I speak for all of the people of the United States when I say that disloyal and subversive elements must be removed from the employ of the Government. We must not, however, permit employees of the Federal Government to be labeled as disloyal or potentially disloyal to their Government when no valid basis exists for arriving at such a conclusion. The overwhelming majority of Federal employees are loyal citizens who are giving conscientiously of their energy and skills to the United States. I do not want them to fear they are the objects of any ‘witch hunt.’ . . . Rumor, gossip, or suspicion will not be sufficient to lead to the dismissal of an employee for disloyalty.”\nPresident Harry Truman, statement on the government’s employee loyalty program, 1947",
