    "description": "“In the last couple of years, a noisy movement has sprung up agitating for ‘women’s rights.’ Suddenly, everywhere we are afflicted with aggressive females on television talk shows yapping about how mistreated American women are, suggesting that marriage has put us in some kind of ‘slavery,’ that housework is menial and degrading, and—perish the thought—that women are discriminated against. . . .\n“The ‘women’s lib’ movement is not an honest effort to secure better jobs for women who want or need to work outside the home. This is just the superficial sweet-talk to win broad support for a radical ‘movement.’ Women’s lib is a total assault on the role of the American woman as wife and mother, and on the family as the basic unit of society.”\nPhyllis Schlafly, political activist, 1972",
