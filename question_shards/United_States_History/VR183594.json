    "description": "“[Ronald] Reagan had won the 1980 election in a dramatic fashion, setting the stage for what many on the right were hoping would be a new era of Republican rule and conservative dominance. . . .\n“. . . President Reagan . . . stated the problem as he saw it: ‘Our government is too big and it spends too much.’ In addition, Reagan worried that American international power had waned since the Vietnam War. The nation, he said, was scared about standing tough against communism.\n“Ultimately, what would come to be known as the Reagan Revolution met with mixed results. Successful as a campaign platform in 1980 and 1984, Reagan’s antigovernment and anti-Communist ideology was hard to translate into a lasting shift to the right in American politics and policy in the popular mind-set.”\nMeg Jacobs and Julian E. Zelizer, historians, Conservatives in Power: The Reagan Years, 1981–1989: A Brief History with Documents, published in 2010",
