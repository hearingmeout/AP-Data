    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: John O’Sullivan, magazine editor, “The Great Nation of Futurity,” United States Magazine and Democratic Review, 1839\n\nYes, we are the nation of progress, of individual freedom, of universal enfranchisement. . . . We must [go] onward to the fulfillment of our mission . . . freedom of conscience, freedom of person, freedom of trade and business pursuits, universality of freedom and equality. . . . For this blessed mission to the nations of the world, which are shut out from the life-giving light of truth, has America been chosen; and her high example shall smite unto death the tyranny of kings, hierarchs, and oligarchs, and carry the glad tidings of peace and good will where myriads [many] now endure an existence scarcely more enviable than that of beasts of the field.\n\nDocument 2\n\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, letter on the Mexican-American War, 1847\n\n[The Mexican-American War] is certainly not a popular war; it was begun and is carried on against the deep moral convictions of the sober portion of the people; its real object, the extension and preservation of slavery, no intelligent man honestly doubts; still, the diabolical motto, “Our country, right or wrong,” gratifies national pride, appears in a patriotic garb, and obtains a sanction practically that is almost universal.\n\nNow, boldly and continually to denounce the war, under such circumstances, as bloody and iniquitous—to impeach the government and the administration . . . to wish success to the Mexicans, as the injured party, who are contending for their firesides and their country against enslaving and remorseless invaders. . . . Our testimony is not in vain. It burns like fire upon the national conscience.\n\nDocument 3\n\n“Cuba,” Putnam’s Monthly Magazine of American Literature, Science, and Art, 1853\n\nIt is a fact, that Cuba longs for admission into our Union. She pleads earnestly and continually. She tells us, that from the moment she becomes an integral [important] portion of the United States, all the exactions [demands] and oppressions which now weigh so heavily upon her, will be at an end. The slave-trade will be abolished; the people will enter at once into the enjoyment of freedom; her ports will be open to the commerce of the world, her soil cultivated to its full capability, her products sent to an unrestricted market; and under the influence of the moral and political forces which are the vital elements of the American nationality, her children educated, and her pulpits and presses set at liberty, she would become the most prosperous of the States.\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Andrew J. Russell, photograph of the golden spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, Utah, marking the linking of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroad lines, 1869.\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University\n\nDocument 5\n\nChief Young Joseph, “An Indian’s Views of Indian Affairs,” North American Review, 1879.\n\nMr. [Spalding] took hold of my father’s arm and said, “Come and sign the treaty.” My father pushed him away, and said: “Why do you ask me to sign away my country? . . . I will not give it up to any man. My people would have no home. Take away your paper. I will not touch it with my hand.”\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: Andrew Carnegie, “Commercial Expansion vs. Colonial Expansion,” 1898.\n\nShould we undertake to hold the Philippines we immediately place the whole republic within the zone of wars and rumors of war, and the rumor of war is in itself destructive to commerce. . . .\n\nWithout distant possessions, the republic, solid, compact, safe from the zone of war disturbance, has captured the world’s markets for many products, and only needs a continuance of peaceful conditions to have the industrial world at its feet. . . .\n\nLet [President William McKinley] consider the Philippines part of the United States . . . and he antagonizes the whole of Europe and has war upon his hands to a certainty—this time no weak Spain to deal with, but the overwhelming naval power of Europe.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Columbia's Easter Bonnet, 1901.\n\nNOTE: The bonnet in the image is a battleship labeled “World Power” with two guns labeled “Army” and “Navy”; the smoke is labeled “Expansion.”\nCourtesy of the Library of Congress",
