    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: Andrew Jackson, speech written to be read to Chickasaw chiefs, 1830.\n\nBrothers, Listen. . . . Respect the opportunity which is now offered to obtain comfortable homes, [as] the time may soon pass away when such advantages as are now within your reach may not again be presented. If from the course you now pursue this shall be the case, then call not upon your great Father hereafter to relieve you of your troubles, but make up your minds conclusively to remain upon the lands you occupy and be subject to the laws of the state where you now reside to the extent that her own citizens are. This you must do, and complain no more . . . it will be useless . . . In a few years, by becoming amalgamated [integrated] with the whites, your national character will be lost; and then like other tribes who have gone before, you must disappear and be forgotten.\n\nBrothers! If you are disposed to remove say so, and state the terms you may consider just and equitable.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Petition against the New Echota Treaty, 1835.\n\nWhereas, we the citizens of . . . the Cherokee Nation, are informed that . . . certain individual Cherokees assembled at New Echota and, without any authority from the council or people of the Nation, entered into an agreement with the Reverend Mr Schermerhorn under the name of a treaty . . . of which all the lands of the Cherokees are ceded; their Government and Law abolished, their private improvements: the property of individuals alienated from their rightful owners, without their consent. . . .\n\nWe the undersigned, do, with the deepest anxiety and the most respectful earnestness, appeal to the Senate of the United States, against the ratification of the [treaty]. . . . The persons . . . acting in behalf of the Cherokees in this matter, are wholly unauthorized.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Caleb B. Smith, speech in the House of Representatives, January 1846.\n\nIf Oregon is ours by “manifest destiny,” so equally is California, Mexico, Canada, and all of the British provinces upon this continent. If our destiny gives us the right to them we may as well at once commence the process of annexing . . . them to the United States.\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Walter Colton, missionary, Three Years in California, 1850.\n\nThe facilities of social and commercial intercourse between our Atlantic and Pacific borders, yet to be created, present a problem of great practical importance. The present route . . . may be regarded as a necessity to be [replaced] . . . by a railroad directly across the continent, within our own jurisdiction. . . . It is now ascertained, that instead of thirty days between New York and San Francisco . . . these points may be reached in seven to eight days by railroad direct, avoiding altogether the [negative] effects of climate on articles of trade.\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: William Seward, speech, “The Contest and the Crisis,” 1855.\n\nAn immediate issue involves the question whether Kansas shall be rescued from jeopardy of Slavery . . . and brought into the Union as a free State. . . .\n\nSlavery, which is now firmly planted on the coast of Mexico, and which extends upward to the border of Kansas, will cross that border, and fasten its outposts on the southern border of British America. Thus the free States will be shut out from the Pacific coast. Divided by this wall . . . Slavery grasps the dominion of the Republic. . . . Shall this be the inglorious end of the Republican system planted at Plymouth—this the inglorious end of the Republic delivered by Lafayette, organized by Hamilton, and consolidated by Washington?\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: The Independent (Oskaloosa, Kansas), newspaper article, 1863.\n\nUnder the beneficent provisions of the Homestead Act, thousands can find excellent lands on the line of the Railroad, and tens of thousands can select the most beautiful locations all over Western Kansas.\n\nLet this war once be brought to a close, and we shall soon see these unoccupied lands made fruitful fields. In no place in the United States can such openings be found for settlement. As yet, but a very small proportion of the Government land is taken.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Marshall Everett, “10,000 Miles from Tip to Tip,” 1899.\n\nCornell University – PJ Mode Collection of Persuasive Cartography",
