    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: Jay Gould, owner of the Union Pacific transcontinental railroad, transcript of his testimony about his purchase of the Kansas Pacific Railway before a congressional commission investigating railroad monopolies, 1887.\n\nCommissioner: What is the advantage of a [railroad] consolidation . . . ?\n\nGould: . . .There are a great many advantages that grow out of the combination of a number of smaller [rail]roads into one strong company. In the first place, it is a great deal better for the country, because the stronger company can protect and develop the [rail]road. It can build a better [rail]road . . . and can run trains more frequently . . . ; and that builds up the country and draws in population. . . . You will always find lands selling higher along a strong [rail]road than along a weak one.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Reverend J. L. Moore, “The Florida Colored Farmers’ Alliance,” article in a Florida newspaper, 1891.\n\nAs members of the Colored Farmers’ Alliance we avowed that we were going to vote with and for the man or party that will secure for the farmer or laboring man his just rights and privileges. . . .\n\nWe are aware of the fact that the laboring colored man’s interests and the laboring white man’s interests are one and the same. Especially is this true at the South. Anything that can be brought about to benefit the workingman, will also benefit the Negro. . . .\n\nSo I for one have fully decided to vote with and work for that party, or those who favor the workingman, let them belong to the Democratic, or Republican, or the People’s Party. . . .\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Populist (People’s) Party campaign poster, 18Courtesy of the Library of Congress\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Jane Addams, 1892 speech at the School of Applied Ethics in Massachusetts, reprinted in her 1910 memoir Twenty Years at Hull-House.\n\nThe Settlement [at Hull-House] . . . is an experimental effort to aid in the solution of the social and industrial problems which are engendered [created] by the modern conditions of life in a great city. . . .\n\nIt must be grounded in a philosophy whose foundation is on the solidarity of the human race, a philosophy which will not waver. . . .\n\nThe highest moralists have taught that without the advance and improvement of the whole, no man can hope for any lasting improvement in his own moral or material individual condition; and that the subjective necessity for Social Settlements is therefore identical with that necessity, which urges us on toward social and individual salvation.\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party presidential candidate, The New Nationalism, 1910.\n\nI stand for the square deal. But when I say that I am for the square deal, I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game, but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity. . . .\n\n. . . This means that our government, national and state, must be freed from the sinister influence or control of special interests. . . . For every special interest is entitled to justice, but not one is entitled to a vote in Congress, to a voice on the [judicial] bench, or to representation in any public office. . . .\n\n. . . The citizens of the United States must effectively control the mighty commercial forces which they have themselves called into being.\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: Florence Kelley, “Persuasion or Responsibility?,” one of a group of pamphlets called the Political Equality Series, circa 1906–1907.\n\nAccording to the latest report of the Department of Education, the percent[age] of our population enrolled in the public schools has diminished during the past five years. . . .\n\nSchools cost money, and boards of education are composed chiefly of business men, men eager to keep down the taxes and willing to have children work. . . .\n\nWhy are these things true? First, they are true because our industrial system calls for cheap labor. . . .\n\nSecond, they are true because the mothers, the teachers, the women fitted by nature and training to guard the welfare of the children are prevented by law from electing the officers who enforce the laws.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Crystal Eastman, social activist, Work-Accidents and the Law, 1910.\n\n“Is there any tendency on the part of the railroad management to emphasize speed and accomplishment at the expense of safety?” I had asked [a railroad worker].\n\n“Yes,” he replied. . . . “The situation could be relieved greatly by giving the men much shorter hours, so they could work at this intense rate without becoming careless toward the end.”",
