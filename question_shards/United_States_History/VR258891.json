    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: John Dickinson, Pennsylvania political leader, Letters from an American Farmer, discussing the Townshend Acts, 1767.\n\nThere is another late act of parliament, . . . destructive to the liberty of these colonies. . . ; that is the act for granting the duties on paper, glass, etc. . . .\n\nNever did the British parliament [before] . . . think of imposing duties in America; FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING A REVENUE. . . .\n\n. . . If [Parliament] ONCE admit, that Great-Britain may lay duties upon her exportations to us, for the purpose of levying money on us only, she then will have nothing to do, but to lay those duties on the articles which she prohibits us to manufacture—and the tragedy of American liberty is finished. . . . If Great-Britain . . . can order us to pay what taxes she pleases before we [import its manufactured goods] . . . , we are as abject slaves.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Report of an agreement made by a group of women in Boston, Massachusetts, Boston Evening-Gazette, 1770.\n\nAt a Time when our invaluable Rights and Privileges are attacked in an unconstitutional and most alarming Manner, and as we find we are reproached for not being so ready as could be desired, to lend our Assistance, we think it our Duty perfectly to concur with the true Friends of Liberty, in all the Measures they have taken to save this abused Country from Ruin and Slavery. And particularly we join with the very respectable Body of Merchants and other Inhabitants of this Town . . . in their Resolutions, totally to abstain from the Use of TEA. . . . This Agreement we cheerfully come into, as we believe the very distressed Situation of our Country requires it, and we do hereby oblige ourselves religiously to observe it, till the late Revenue Acts are repealed.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Petition written by a free African American on behalf of Belinda Sutton, a formerly enslaved African American, to the Massachusetts state legislature, 1783.\n\n[For] Fifty years [Belinda’s] faithful hands have been compelled to ignoble servitude for the benefit of . . . Isaac Royall [a Loyalist colonel in the British Army], until . . . the terrors of men, armed in the cause of freedom, compelled her master to [escape to Great Britain]. . . .\n\n. . . By the laws of the land, [Belinda] is denied the enjoyment of one morsel of that immense wealth [of Isaac Royall], a part whereof hath been accumulated by her own industry. . . .\n\n. . . She prays that [an] allowance may be made [to] her, out of the estate of Colonel Royall.\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: George Washington, letter to James Madison discussing Shays’ Rebellion, 1786.\n\nWe are fast verging to anarchy and confusion! A letter which I have just received . . . from Massachusetts . . . is replete with melancholy information of the temper and designs of a considerable part of that people. . . . [It] says . . . “They are determined to annihilate all debts public and private.” . . .\n\nWhat stronger evidence can be given of the want of energy in our governments than these disorders?\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: Benjamin Rush, physician and political leader from Pennsylvania, Thoughts Upon Female Education, 1787.\n\nThe education of young ladies, in this country, should be conducted upon principles . . . in some respects different from what it was when we were a part of a monarchical empire. . . .\n\nThe equal share that every citizen has in the liberty, and the possible share he may have in the government of our country, make it necessary that our ladies should be qualified to a certain degree, by a peculiar and suitable education, to concur in instructing their sons in the principles of liberty and government. . . .\n\n. . . It is high time . . . to adopt manners in every thing, that shall be accommodated . . . to the forms of our government.\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: An Address to the People of the State of New-York, pamphlet published anonymously, 1788.\n\nThe advocates for the proposed new constitution . . . admit it is liable to well-founded objections—that a number of its articles ought to be amended; [and] that if alterations do not take place, a door will be left open for . . . encroachments on the liberties of the people. . . . Is it probable that those who enjoy [the Constitution’s] powers will be so likely to surrender them after they have them in possession . . . ? Common sense says they will not.\n\n. . . The idea of receiving a form [of government] radically defective, under the notion of making the necessary amendment [later], is evidently absurd.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Frederick Kemmelmeyer, Washington Reviewing the Western Army at Fort Cumberland, Maryland, depicting events in 1794 during a tax revolt by western farmers called the Whiskey Rebellion, circa 1800.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Gift of Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, 1963",
