    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: William M. Dickson, judge and advisor to Abraham Lincoln, speech delivered at a college in Ohio, 1865.\n\nMy friends, every consideration which ought to influence human conduct, requires that the ballot should be given to the black man.\n\nThe protection of the black man himself requires it; gratitude for his devoted loyalty requires it; the protection of our civilization from the influence of a degraded and barbarous element requires it; the protection of ourselves from the insidious rebel ballot requires it; the speedy restoration of the rebel states to their proper relation to the General Government requires it; the fundamental principles of our Government require it; the Golden Rule of our most holy religion commanding us to do unto others as we would that they should do unto us, requires it. Can we withhold it?\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Edmonia Highgate, African American teacher and daughter of formerly enslaved parents from New York, letter to Reverend M. E. Strieby of the American Missionary Association about events in Louisiana, 1866.\n\nI have a very interesting and constantly growing day school, a night school, and, a glorious Sabbath School of near one hundred scholars. The school is under the auspices of the Freedman's Bureau, yet it is wholly self-supporting. The majority of my pupils come from plantations, three, four and even eight miles distant. So anxious are they to learn that they walk these distances so early in the morning as never to be tardy. . . .\n\nThere has been much opposition to the School. . . . The rebels here threatened to burn down the school and house in which I board.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Fourteenth Amendment, 1868.\n\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: W. W. Holden, governor of North Carolina, proclamation, 1869.\n\nNo set of men can take the law into their own hands. Every citizen, however humble, or whatever his color, has a right to be at peace in his own house. . . . If there be those who counsel resistance to established authority, such persons are traitors and should be punished accordingly; if there be those who, disguised or masked, enter the dwellings of others by force and commit acts of violence, such persons are guilty of [a] felony. . . .\n\n. . . It is my fixed purpose to protect every citizen without regard to his antecedents [ancestors], his color or his political opinions; but to do this the law must be sacred . . . and must be inflexibly maintained.\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: Charles Sumner, Radical Republican senator from Massachusetts, speech to the United States Senate, 1872.\n\nAll that I ask is that . . . there be complete equality before the law everywhere. . . .\n\nThe Constitution is an earthly body . . . ; the Declaration [of Independence] is the very soul itself. . . . The claim of equal rights stands on the Constitution interpreted by the Declaration of Independence. . . .\n\n. . . Any phrase in the Constitution, take any power, and you are to bring it all in subordination to those lofty primal truths [in the Declaration of Independence]. . . . When you come to those several specific powers. . . defining citizenship . . . and guarding [citizens] against any denial of the equal protection of the laws. . . , every one of those safeguards must be interpreted so as best to maintain equal rights.\n\n. . . Those truths [in the Declaration of Independence] can never die. It is for us to see that they are recognized without delay in the administration of our own Government.\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: National Conference of the Colored Men of the United States, report, 1879.\n\nAnother and important cause [of migration] is the almost, if not the total, failure on the part of any Democratic State administration in the South to faithfully carry out and perform their promises made to the colored people when said Democracy assumed control of their respective State governments. . . .\n\nIn the short space of two years the Democratic party of the south has fully satisfied the colored people here that they are not the safe custodians of their political and civil rights. . . .\n\nThe colored people of the southern States have become thoroughly alarmed at the constant attacks on their political and civil rights, not only by legislative enactments and verdicts of courts, more especially through and by the medium of State constitutional conventions.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Photograph of George Washington Carver with students in the chemistry laboratory at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, taken around 1900.\n\nCourtesy of the Library of Congress",
