    "description": "“It may be asked . . . regarding [unbelievers] who are not subjects [of the Spanish Crown], whether Christian princes can convert them by violence and the sword . . . ? The reply is that they cannot, because the king of Spain has no greater power over them than I do over my fellow citizens. . . .\n“A doubt arises whether it is lawful to smash down the idols of these barbarians, once the faith has been preached to them and they have refused to accept it? . . . I say that this ought not to be done on every occasion, primarily because it may provoke their fierce indignation, and destroy any kind feelings toward us which they may happen to have.”\nFrancisco de Vitoria, Spanish theologian, “On the Evangelization of Unbelievers,” 1534–1535",
