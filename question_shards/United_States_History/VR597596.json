    "description": "“Question. Are not the Colonies, from their circumstances, very able to pay the stamp duty?\n“Answer. In my opinion there is not gold and silver enough in the Colonies to pay the stamp duty for one year. . . .\n“Question. Do you think it right that America should be protected by this country and pay no part of the expense?\n“Answer. That is not the case. The Colonies raised, clothed, and paid, during the last war, near twenty-five thousand men, and spent many millions. . . .\n“Question. What was the temper [opinion or attitude] of America toward Great Britain before the year 1763 ?\n“Answer. The best in the world. They submitted willingly to the government of the Crown, and paid, in all their courts, obedience to acts of Parliament. . . .\n“Question. And what is their temper now?\n“Answer. Oh, very much altered. . . .\n“Question. Was it an opinion in America before 1763 that the Parliament had no right to lay taxes and duties there?\n“Answer. I never heard an objection to the right of laying duties to regulate commerce; but a right to lay internal taxes was never supposed to be in Parliament, as we are not represented there.”\nBenjamin Franklin, testimony before the British Parliament regarding the Stamp Act, 1766",
