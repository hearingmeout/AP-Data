    "description": "“The federal government never acknowledged that a Conservative insurgency was underway in the South [after 1865]. . . . [It] simply divided the former Confederate states into five military districts, each commanded by a major general. . . .\n“Army officers had neither the orders nor the desire to provide military protection for the fledgling Republican state governments created by the Reconstruction Acts. Like any other states in the Union, these were expected to provide for their own security. Anxious to gain political legitimacy in the eyes of a white population who largely regarded them as ‘regimes,’ these state governments had strong reasons to downplay the subversive activities within their borders. Instead, . . . they respected the civil liberties of ex-Confederates and, with only a few exceptions, permitted their bitterest foes full participation [in] the political process. They treated the Ku Klux Klan’s extensive campaigns of murder, assault, and intimidation as mere criminal activity. Those accused of such acts therefore enjoyed full access to the courts—and often dominated them.”\nMark Grimsley, historian, “Wars for the American South: The First and Second Reconstructions Considered as Insurgencies,” Civil War History, 2012",
