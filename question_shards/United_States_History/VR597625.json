    "description": "“[After the mid-nineteenth century,] Whites did not set out, directly at least, to destroy the Indians’ life. They were simply following a script that had no Indians in it, except as exotic relics. Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Comanches, Kiowas, and Plains Apaches were pushed aside by consequences of another dream. . . . The advantages of the invader were incalculable—a population hundreds of times that of the Indians, gigantic reserves of capital, a technology capable of changing its world with a twitch. Despite their adaptive genius, the plains nomads could not possibly sustain themselves against that force.\n“Plains Indians were left with two dreadful choices. They could try to accommodate, surrendering their vision, or they could try to resist the inevitable.”\nElliott West, historian, The Contested Plains: Indians, Goldseekers, and the Rush to Colorado, 1998",
