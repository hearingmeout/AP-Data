    "description": "“After driving all day and night, we arrived at the grounds of the Washington Monument just in time for the [1963 March on Washington, where Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ‘I Have a Dream’ speech]. . . . I sat on the grass and listened to the speakers, to discover we had ‘dreamers’ instead of leaders leading us. . . . Martin Luther King went on and on talking about his dream. I sat there thinking that in Canton [Mississippi] we never had time to sleep, much less dream. . . .\n“I guess this bombing [of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, two weeks later] is Birmingham’s answer to the march. But what’s gonna be our answer to the bombing? . . . If Martin Luther King thinks nonviolence is really going to work for the South as it did for India, then he is out of his mind.”\nAnne Moody, African American community organizer in Canton, Mississippi, from her book Coming of Age in Mississippi, 1968",
