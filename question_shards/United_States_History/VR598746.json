Use complete sentences; an outline or bulleted list alone is not acceptable.\n\n“Distance and inadequate training in agricultural pursuits closed the frontier to eastern workingmen; instead America was settled by successive waves of farmers who were already skilled in wresting a living from the soil. Farming, even before the day of mechanization, was a highly technical profession; frontiering required a knowledge of even more specialized techniques. Clearing the land, building a home, fencing fields, solving the problem of defense, and planting crops on virgin soil all demanded experience few workingmen could boast. . . .\n\n“. . . Romantic characters took part [in frontier migration]: . . . trappers and leatherclad ‘Mountain Men,’ starry-eyed prospectors and hard-riding cowboys, badmen and vigilantes. But the true hero of the tale was the hard-working farmer who, ax in hand, marched ever westward until the boundaries of his nation touched the Pacific.”\n\nRay Allen Billington, historian, Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier, 1949\n\n“The rapid expansion of wagework in the United States . . . and the most intensive phase of the exploitation and settlement of the western third of the continent were roughly contemporaneous processes that occurred during a seventy-year interval [beginning in 1848]. Yet, at first glance, the terms frontier and wagework seem to describe mutually exclusive conditions. . . . In actuality, . . . one such conjunction [of these terms] was the wageworkers’ frontier. . . .\n\n“. . . The wageworkers’ frontier . . . was foremost a predominantly male community of manual labor dependent upon others for wages in the extractive industries of the sparsely settled Rocky Mountain and Pacific regions of the United States. . . . It also represented a zone of extremely rapid transition from wilderness to industrial, post-frontier society. . . . The wageworkers’ frontier was a fragile entity forever at the mercy of the outside world’s pricing of its basic [export] commodities. . . . All [commodities] were shipped out of the west because the Rocky Mountain and Pacific regions contained too few people . . . to constitute a viable home market. Settlements on the wageworkers’ frontier tended to resemble factory towns in Pennsylvania or Massachusetts.”\n\nCarlos A. Schwantes, historian, “The Concept of the Wageworkers’ Frontier,” 1987",
