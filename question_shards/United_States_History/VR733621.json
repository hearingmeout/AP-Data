    "description": "“North America . . . was seen in the hopeful context of all the other trade relationships English merchants were constructing [in the early 1600s]. . . . [It was not] completely farfetched to think that American Indians might willingly participate in such trade [with Europeans]. In fact, the possibility . . . was originally proposed to French fishermen by [Native] Americans, and the acquisition of [trade goods] from throughout the great Canadian interior was organized entirely by native-run networks. Only the final exchange on the coast involved Europeans. . . .\n“Getting the relationship with the [American] Indians right at the outset figured heavily in the [English colonial investors’] thinking [about Virginia].”\nKaren Ordahl Kupperman, historian, The Jamestown Project, 2007",
