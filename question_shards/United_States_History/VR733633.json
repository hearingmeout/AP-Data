    "description": "“The peculiarity of [the founding of the United States] is that, even as the nation legitimated itself in the principle of consent . . . it confronted a stubbornly entrenched institution that seemed to epitomize the very denial of consent, the very antithesis of liberal government: the widespread institution of African slavery. . . .\n“[In Virginia] slaves labored on the plantations of [Thomas] Jefferson, [James] Madison, and [George] Washington, among others. . . . Not only did this vast [enslaved] population personify what the lack of consent could mean, it also raised the possibility that slaves might not retain their status forever; that they might rise up . . . just as white Americans had done. . . .\n“How could a young nation reconcile slavery with the principles of consent and self-government?”\nFrançois Furstenberg, historian, In the Name of the Father: Washington’s Legacy, Slavery, and the Making of a Nation, 2006",
