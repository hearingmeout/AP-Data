    "description": "“I was particularly gratified to be favored from yourself with your sentiments on that interesting subject which has engaged so much of the attention of Congress during its present Session. . . . I think there can be no doubt of the impropriety of the interference of Government, in the direction of labor and capital . . . so far as it respects our own Country; but I have supposed that it ought to interfere, in behalf of our own people, against the policy and the measures of Foreign Governments [to protect their industries from competition]. . . .\n“. . . The measure of protection which [the bill passed by Congress] affords is short of what many of its friends wished; but considering the sensibilities which have been awakened, and the . . . diversity of interests which exist in our Country it is perhaps better that we should advance slowly. . . . I can not however but hope and believe that . . . we shall see, after a few years, that it will have accomplished much.”\nHenry Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives, letter to former President James Madison, 1824",
