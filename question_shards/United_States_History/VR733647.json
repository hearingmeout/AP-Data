    "description": "“Does the proper division of local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbid our Federal Government to control as to [the existence of] slavery in our Federal Territories? . . .\n“In 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act was passed to enforce the [Northwest] Ordinance of [17]87. . . . It went through all its stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches . . . [with] an unanimous passage. In this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine [founding] fathers who framed the original Constitution. . . . The . . . number of those [founders] whom I have shown to have acted upon the question of [slavery in the territories] . . . is twenty-three. . . . [Only] two of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories. . . .\n“. . . As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity. Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it, be, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained. For this Republicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content.”\nAbraham Lincoln, speech delivered in New York City while he was seeking to be nominated as the Republican candidate for the presidency, 1860",
