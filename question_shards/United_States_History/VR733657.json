    "description": "“[The Pullman Association owns] very nearly 4,000 acres [of land]. . . . We will not sell an acre under any circumstances, and we will only lease to parties whom we are well satisfied will conform with our ideas in developing the place. We will not allow any saloons or drinking-resorts in the town. We shall do all we can to cultivate the better natures of our workmen. . . . My idea has always been that it was to the employer’s interest to see that his men are clean, contented, sober, educated, and happy. They make better workmen, and they develop the employer’s industries more. I shall try to benefit humanity where it is in my power to do so. Here we shall have every attribute of a town exemplified, and I hope to be able to provide each and every attraction that can be desired—churches, schools, gymnasiums, [and] reading rooms.”\nGeorge Pullman, industrialist, describing the creation of the Pullman company town in Illinois, Chicago Tribune, 1881",
