    "description": "“[In the South in the 1880s] some African Americans were looking to diversify their political options by working with white [political] independents. . . . The potential for [political] victories for independent white candidates through black electoral support was not lost on Democratic leadership. In 1888, North Carolina Democrats reacted to the black and independent threat by passing election laws that gave greater discretion to handpicked Democratic election registrars to disqualify potential voters. . . . The pattern of black disfranchisement continued in other parts of the South. In Georgia, independent political efforts challenging or seeking to reform the Democratic Party led to the establishment of ‘white primaries’ in the 1880s, further blocking black electoral participation. . . .\n“. . . Relatively low voter participation among African Americans was therefore a consequence of direct attacks on their voting rights, not simply black voter ‘apathy.’ . . . African Americans . . . were living under hostile political conditions that often made it impossible to vote for candidates of their choosing.”\nOmar H. Ali, historian, In the Lion’s Mouth: Black Populism in the New South, 1886–1900, published in 2010",
