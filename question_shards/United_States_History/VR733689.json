    "description": "“The brutal attacks on New York and Washington [on September 11, 2001] did, however, bring a tidal wave of renewed visibility and leverage to the presidential office. President [George W.] Bush’s standing to lead soared, and he seized the reins. On a variety of fronts, legislators hastened to expand his authority. With just one dissenting vote in either chamber . . .
