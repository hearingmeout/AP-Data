    "description": "“The brutal attacks on New York and Washington [on September 11, 2001] did, however, bring a tidal wave of renewed visibility and leverage to the presidential office. President [George W.] Bush’s standing to lead soared, and he seized the reins. On a variety of fronts, legislators hastened to expand his authority. With just one dissenting vote in either chamber . . . Congress passed a resolution on September 14, 2001, stating that ‘the president has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States.’ . . . Overall, Bush received historically high levels of legislative support throughout his first term. As 2006 began he had yet to veto a single bill, this five-year streak the longest since Thomas Jefferson’s administration.”\nAndrew Rudalevige, political scientist, “The Contemporary Presidency,” Presidential Studies Quarterly, 2006",
