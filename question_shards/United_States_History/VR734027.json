Use complete sentences; an outline or bulleted list alone is not acceptable.\n\n“Working-class Chicagoans—male and female, black and white, . . . immigrants from eastern and southern Europe or their children—were . . . asserting themselves in new ways in the larger political arena. During the 1930s, Chicago workers, along with men and women elsewhere in the nation, had begun to vote Democratic more consistently and in greater numbers than ever before, joining President Franklin Roosevelt’s ‘New Democratic Coalition.’ . . . Supporting the Democrats . . . , they felt, would ensure a more activist federal government committed to providing the benefits that over time have become associated with ‘the welfare state.’”\n\nSource: Lizabeth Cohen, historian, Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939, published in 1991\n\n“Far more enduring was the New Deal’s intimate partnership with those in the South who preached white supremacy. . . . Southern representatives acted . . . as an indispensable part of the governing party. New Deal lawmaking would have failed without . . . southern members of Congress. Here lay an acute incongruity. The New Deal permitted, or at least turned a blind eye toward, an organized system of racial cruelty. This alliance was a crucial part of its supportive structure. The New Deal thus collaborated with the South’s racial hegemony as it advanced liberal democracy.”\n\nSource: Ira Katznelson, historian, Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time, published in 2013",
