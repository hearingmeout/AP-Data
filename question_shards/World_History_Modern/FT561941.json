    "description": "Refer to the passage below.\n\n“During the reign of the Hebrew king Solomon, son of David, the Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, learning of his reputation for wisdom, came from Ethiopia to see and to hear him. Solomon, who had seven hundred queens as wives, received the Queen of Sheba into their number even though she was black. And when she later bore him a son in Ethiopia, she named him after his grandfather, David. This prince, wishing to receive the blessing of his father, came to Jerusalem when he was 22 years old. Solomon not only recognized him as his son, but had him anointed in the Temple, with all proper royal ceremony, as king of Ethiopia. This is the origin of the emperors of Ethiopia, one thousand years before the incarnation of the Son of God. Thus, when the Son of God became man and took the blood of the descendants of David, he had already given that same blood to the blacks of Ethiopia.”\n\nSermon delivered by Antonio Vieira, Portuguese Jesuit priest, to plantation workers in Bahia, Brazil, 1633",
