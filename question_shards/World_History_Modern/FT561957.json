    "description": "“Without a revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. The role of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a party that is guided by the most advanced theory. We have said that there could not have been Social-Democratic consciousness among the workers. It could only be brought to them from without. The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labor legislation. The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical, and economic theories elaborated by educated representatives of the propertied classes, the intellectuals. Our worst sin with regard to organization is that by our amateurishness we have lowered the prestige of revolutionaries in Russia.”\n\nVladimir Lenin, Russian exile in Switzerland, What Is to Be Done?, 1902",
