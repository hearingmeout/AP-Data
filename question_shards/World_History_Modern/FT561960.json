    "description": "“Executing the directives of the International Monetary Fund, the government of the dictator Gaviria* precipitously opens our borders and internal markets to big foreign capital and production. It privatizes important state enterprises and entities, lays off workers and other employees en masse, guarantees broad benefits to the owner-speculators of finance capital, removes incentives for agricultural production, and puts national producers into bankruptcy. This is the development of savage capitalism, of neo-liberalism in which economic growth opposes social well-being.”\n\n*César Gaviria Trujillo, president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994\n\nPolitical declaration of the Eighth Conference of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), rebel group, Colombia, 1993",
