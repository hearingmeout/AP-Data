    "description": "“In theory, all of the peoples of the world, though different in their degree of civilization and enlightenment are created equal and are brothers before God. As universal love advances, the theory goes, and as the regulations of international law are put into place, the entire world will soon be at peace. This theory is currently espoused mainly by Western Christian ministers or by persons who are enamored of that religion. However, when we leave this fiction and look at the facts regarding international relations today, we find them shockingly different. Do nations honor treaties? We find not the slightest evidence that they do. When countries break treaties, there are no courts to judge them. Therefore, whether a treaty is honored or not depends entirely on the financial and military powers of the countries involved. Money and soldiers are not for the protection of existing principles; they are the instruments for the creation of principles where none exist.\n\nThere are those moralists who would sit and wait for the day when all wars would end. Yet in my opinion the Western nations are growing ever stronger in the skills of war. In recent years, these countries devise strange new weapons and day by day increase their standing armies. One can argue that that is truly useless, truly stupid. Yet if others are working on being stupid, then I must respond in kind. If others are violent, then I too must become violent. International politics is the way of force rather than the way of virtue—and we should accept that.”\n\nYukichi Fukuzawa, Japanese intellectual, Commentary on the Current Problems, 1881",
