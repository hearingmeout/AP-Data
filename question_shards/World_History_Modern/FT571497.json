    "description": "Poem 1\n\n“The world calls us coolie.*\n\nWhy doesn’t our flag fly anywhere?\n\nHow shall we survive, are we slaves forever? Why aren’t we involved in politics?\n\nFrom the beginning we have been oppressed. Why don’t we even dream of freedom?\n\nOnly a handful of oppressors have taken our fields. Why has no Indian cultivator risen and protected his land?\n\nOur children cry out for want of education. Why don’t we open science colleges?”\n\n*An insulting term for South or East Asian manual workers\n\nPoem 2\n\n“Why do you sit silent in your own country You who make so much noise in foreign lands? Noise outside of India is of little avail.\n\nPay attention to activities within India.\n\nYou are quarreling and Hindu-Muslim conflict is prevalent.\n\nThe jewel of India is rotting in the earth because you are fighting over the Vedas and the Koran.\n\nGo and speak with soldiers.\n\nAsk them why they are asleep, men who once held swords.\n\nMuslim, Hindu, and Sikh heroes should join together. The power of the oppressors is nothing if we unitedly attack him.\n\nIndians have been the victors in the battlefields of Burma, Egypt, China and the Sudan.”",
