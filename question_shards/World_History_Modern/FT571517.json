    "description": "“There is no doubt that the Gujaratis from the northwest coast of India are men who understand merchandise; they are also diligent, quick men in trade. They do their accounts with numbers like ours. There are also merchants from Egypt settled in Gujarat, as well as many merchants from Persia and the Arabian Peninsula, all of whom do a great trade in the seaport towns of Gujarat. Those of our people who want to be clerks and traders ought to go there and learn, because the business of trade is a science in itself.”\n\nTomé Pires, Portuguese merchant, book describing travels in South Asia, 1515",
