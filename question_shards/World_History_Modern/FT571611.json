    "description": "“When we were in Canton, a port in southern China, we came across a woman who cried out in Portuguese ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.’ And because she could speak no more of our language, she very earnestly asked us in Chinese to tell her whether we were Christians. We replied that we were, and for proof we repeated all the rest of the Lord’s Prayer which she had left unsaid. Being assured that we were Christians, she pulled us aside, and weeping said to us, ‘Come along, Christians from the other end of the world, with your true sister in the faith of Jesus Christ.’\n\nFurthermore, she told us that she was named Inez de Leyria, and her father was a great ambassador from Portugal to the Emperor of China. The ambassador married her mother, a Chinese woman, and made her a Christian. Along with her, many were converted to the faith of Christ.\n\nDuring the five days we remained in her house, we made them a little book in Chinese, containing many good prayers.”\n\nAccount of Fernão Mendes Pinto, Portuguese explorer and merchant, circa",
