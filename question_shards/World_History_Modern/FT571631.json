    "description": "“The Australian nation is another case of a great civilization supplanting a lower race unable to make full use of the land and its resources. The struggle means suffering, intense suffering, while it is in progress; but that struggle and that suffering have been the stages by which the White man has reached his present stage of development, and they account for the fact that he no longer lives in caves and feeds on roots and nuts.
