    "description": "“I belong to those scientists who consider that the drying up of the Aral Sea is far more advantageous than preserving it.

Second, the disappearance of the Sea will not affect the region’s landscapes.”\n\nA. Babayev, president of Soviet Turkmenistan’s Academy of Sciences, late 1950s",
