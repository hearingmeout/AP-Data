    "description": "“Scholars have been mesmerized by the huge extent of the present distribution of Bantu languages and could think of only a single process, an equally huge human migration, ‘the Bantu expansion,’ to explain it.... [This] scenario is fatally flawed, however, for two reasons. First it fell prey to the illusion that only a migration could fit the evidence.... [But] a language can spread without involving the migration of any communities. The second fatal error was to collapse a history which encompassed the developments of one to several millennia into a single migration event. The evidence shows that many different dispersals of single languages succeeded each other at different times, not continuously.”\n\nJan Vansina, historian, “New Linguistic Evidence and ‘the Bantu Expansion,’” scholarly article, 1995",
