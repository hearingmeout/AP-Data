Refuse to do it!\n\nDon’t go to fight in the war! Just say no!’\n\nIf someone’s blood must be shed,\n\nThen shed yours, Mr. President! Lead by example!\n\nAnd if you decide to hunt me down, warn your police\n\nthat I will be unarmed, and that they can go ahead and shoot.”\n\n*a reference to the war in French Vietnam\n\nBoris Vian, French poet, “The Deserter,” 1954",
