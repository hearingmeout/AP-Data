    "description": "“The evil-disposed in these districts [of England] began to rise, saying, they were too severely oppressed; that at the beginning of the world there were no slaves, and that no one ought to be treated as such. . . .

A crazy priest in the county of Kent, called John Ball, who for his absurd preaching, had been thrice confined in prison, inflamed those ideas. He would say: ‘Are we not all descended from the same parents, Adam and Eve? and what can the lords show, or what reasons give, why they should be more the masters than ourselves?’ ”\n\nJean Froissart, account of a peasant revolt in England, 1381",
