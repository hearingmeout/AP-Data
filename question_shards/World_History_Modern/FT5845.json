    "question": "“Americans today . . . who live within the Spanish system occupy a position in society no better than that of serfs destined for labor, or at best they have no more status than that of mere consumers. Yet even this status is surrounded with galling restrictions, such as being forbidden to grow European crops, or to store products which are royal monopolies, or to establish factories of a type the Peninsula itself does not possess. To this add the exclusive trading privileges, even in articles of prime necessity, and the barriers between American provinces, designed to prevent all exchange of trade, traffic, and understanding.”\n\nSimón Bolívar, Jamaica Letter, 1815\n\nThe quotation above best supports which of the following conclusions about the author’s motives for resistance to Spanish colonial rule in Latin America?",
