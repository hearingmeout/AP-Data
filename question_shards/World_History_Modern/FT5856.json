    "question": "“Recent years have seen a dramatic shift to the left in the politics of Latin America. This shift . . . has given rise to renewed interest in Che Guevara’s ideals of Pan-American unity, anti-imperialism, and humanist socialism. The rather remarkable change in direction of the region’s politics has occurred largely in response to the [unpopularity] of the neoliberal agenda of ‘free market’ and 'free-trade' capitalism pursued by the United States Government, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and most of the governments of the region.”\nRichard L. Harris, Death of a Revolutionary: Che Guevara’s Last Mission, 2000\nWhich of the following best describes the main argument that Harris is making in the passage above?",
