    "description": "World Economic Theory, 1500-1800\n\nThe world economic system that developed after 1500 featured unequal relationships between western Europe and dependent economies in other regions. Strong governments and large armies fed European dominance of world trade. Dependent economies used slave or serf labor to produce cheap foods and minerals for Europe and they imported more expensive European items in turn. Dependent regions had weak governments which made European penetration and slave systems possible.",
