    "description": "“Americans . . . who live within the Spanish system occupy a position in society as mere consumers. Yet even this status is surrounded with galling restrictions, such as being forbidden to grow European crops, or to store products that are royal monopolies, or to establish factories of a type the Peninsula itself does not possess. To this, add the exclusive trading privileges, even in articles of prime necessity . . . in short, do you wish to know what our future held?–simply the cultivation of the fields of indigo, grain, coffee, sugarcane, cacao, and cotton; cattle raising on the broad plains; hunting wild game in the jungles; digging in the earth to mine its gold.”\n\nSimón Bolívar, “Jamaica Letter,” 1815",
