    "description": "“In the past, at the end of the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, bands of rebels were innumerable, all because of foolish rulers and misgovernment, so that none of these rebellions could be stamped out.

He has not increased the land tax, nor has he conscripted soldiers from households. . . .
