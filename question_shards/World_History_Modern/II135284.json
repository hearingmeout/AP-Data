    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant examples of evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period circa 1200–1450, the rise of Islamic states in many regions of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa led to increased interactions between Muslims and Christians. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which these interactions led to cultural, intellectual, or technological transfers and/or changes in Afro-Eurasia in this period.",
