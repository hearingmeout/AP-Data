Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period circa 1800–1914, various non-Western states implemented programs to reform and modernize their economies and militaries.
