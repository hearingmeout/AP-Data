    "description": "“At school the teachers say it is our patriotic duty to stop using foreign words. I didn’t know what they meant by this at first, but now I see it—you must no longer say ‘adieu’ [‘farewell’] because that is French. It is in order to say ‘lebwohl’ [‘farewell’ in German] instead. We also have a little tin box in which we’ll put some small change in every time we slip up and use a foreign word. The contents of this little war savings box will go towards buying knitting wool. We must now knit woollen things for the soldiers.”",
