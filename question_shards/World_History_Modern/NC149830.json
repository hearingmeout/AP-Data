    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period circa 1750 to 1900, revolutions and independence movements such as the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, and Latin American independence movements occurred around the world. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which Enlightenment ideas were the primary cause of one of the revolutions or independence movements (other than the American Revolution) from the period circa 1750 to 1900.",
