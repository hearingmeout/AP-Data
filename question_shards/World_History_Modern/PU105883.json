    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity, or change) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period circa 1200–1450, cities in various parts of Afro-Eurasia experienced periods of both decline and growth due to various factors. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which political factors were the primary cause for the rise or decline of cities in Afro-Eurasia during the period 1200–1450.",
