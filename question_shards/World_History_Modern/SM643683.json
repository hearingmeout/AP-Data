    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period circa 1450–1750, the global increase in transregional contacts led to both expansion and contraction of existing religions as well as the development of new religious practices. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which military conflict or conquest was the main cause of religious change in this period.",
