Use complete sentences; an outline or bulleted list alone is not acceptable.\n\nUse the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows.\n\n“Having questioned Sidotti,* I understand that Christians teach that their God produced heaven and earth and make him out to be the Great Lord and Father. This God of theirs, they say, cannot be served without giving him all of one’s love and all of one’s reverence. What these Christians are in effect saying is this: I have a [real] father, but I do not love him because I reserve all my love for God; I have a [real] lord, but I don’t revere him because I reserve all my reverence for God. Now this is what we call being impious and disloyal! According to the Book of Rites, it is the emperor, the Son of Heaven, who should be worshiping God, the Lord of Heaven. It is not a duty that is given to ordinary people. And that is in order to prevent the blurring of the line between the exalted and the base. Thus, the sovereign is Heaven to the subjects just as the father is Heaven to the child.”\n\n*Giovanni Battista Sidotti was an Italian priest who had entered Japan in 1708, in violation of the Japanese government’s prohibition on Christian missionary activities.\n\nArai Hakuseki, Japanese scholar and adviser to the Tokugawa shogun, report, circa 1720",
