    "description": "“To the most holy father, the Pope:\nMost of our kingdom of Hungary was reduced to a desert by the scourge of the Mongols’ invasion. Now, we receive news every day that the Mongols have again unified their forces and will soon send their countless troops against all of Europe. We are afraid that we will be unable to withstand the Mongols’ ferocity in battle unless the Pope is able to persuade other Christian rulers to send us aid to fortify our kingdom.\nWhen the Mongols invaded in 1241, we sent requests for military aid to the papacy, the Holy Roman Emperor, the king of France, and others. But from all of them we received only words of support. We, for shame, resorted to inviting pagan Cumans* into our kingdom.\nIf, God forbid, our kingdom fell to the Mongols, the door would be open for them to invade the other regions of the Catholic faith from the Hungarian steppes. So, the people in our kingdom cannot cease to be amazed that you offer substantial help to the Christian territories overseas, which if they were lost would not harm the inhabitants of Europe more than if our kingdom fell.”\n*a people who dwelled along the steppes of the Black Sea and in Central Asia\nKing Béla IV of Hungary, letter to Pope Innocent IV, circa 1250",
