    "description": "“I argue that the current state of affairs is unsound and unsustainable. Financial markets are inherently unstable and there are social needs that cannot be met by giving market forces free rein. Unfortunately, these defects are not recognized. Instead, there is a widespread belief that markets are self-correcting. . . . It is claimed that the common interest is best served by allowing everyone to look out for his or her own interests and that attempts to protect the common interest by collective decision making distort the market mechanism. This idea was called laissez-faire in the nineteenth century. . . . I have found a better name for it: market fundamentalism. . . .\nTo put the matter simply, market forces, if they are given complete authority even in the purely economic and financial arenas, produce chaos and could ultimately lead to the downfall of the global financial system. . . . Capitalism needs a counterweight because the capitalist system by itself shows no tendency toward equilibrium. The owners of capital seek to maximize their profits. Left to their own devices, they would continue to accumulate capital until the situation became unbalanced.”\nGeorge Soros, United States financial investment mogul and philanthropist, The Crisis of Global Capitalism, 1998",
