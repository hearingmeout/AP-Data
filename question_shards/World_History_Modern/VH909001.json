    "description": "“The present world is an open one. China’s past backwardness was due to its closed-door policy [to trade]. After the founding of the People’s Republic, we were blockaded by others and so the country remained closed to some extent, which created great difficulties for us. We are suggesting that we should develop a little faster and open up to the outside. So, we have opened fourteen medium and large coastal cities to foreign investment, manufacturing, and trade.\nOur socialist economic base is so huge that it can absorb tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign funds without shaking our socialist foundations. Thus, foreign investment will serve as a major supplement to the building of socialism in our country. We believe that the road we have chosen—building socialism with Chinese characteristics—is the right one. We have followed this road for five and a half years and the pace of development has so far exceeded our expectations.”\nDeng Xiaoping, leader of the communist party of China, speech to a Japanese delegation, 1984",
