    "description": "“Twenty years of Green Revolution agriculture have succeeded in destroying the fertility of the soils of Punjab [a state in northern India] which had been maintained over generations for centuries and could have been maintained indefinitely if international agribusiness experts and their Indian followers had not mistakenly believed that their technologies could substitute land, and their chemicals could replace the organic fertility of soils. It has been the assumption of the Green Revolution that nutrient loss and nutrient deficit can be made up by the use of non-renewable inputs of chemical fertilizers. The natural nutrient cycle, in which nutrients are produced by plants and returned to the soil as organic matter has thus been replaced by the belief in linear non-renewable flows of chemicals: phosphorus and potash mined from geological deposits and nitrogen derived from petroleum.\nThe Green Revolution created the perception that soil fertility is produced in chemical factories, and agricultural yields are measured only through marketed commodities. Yet, as the Punjab experience has shown, the fertility of soils cannot be reduced to Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium inputs from the factories of multinational corporations. Agribusiness technologies cannot substitute nature or work outside of nature’s ecological processes without destroying the very basis of agricultural production. Nor can markets provide the only meaningful measure of ‘output’ and ‘yields.’”\nVandana Shiva, Indian scholar, feminist, environmentalist, and anti-globalization activist, The Violence of the Green Revolution: Ecological Degradation and Political Conflict in Punjab, book published in 1989.",
