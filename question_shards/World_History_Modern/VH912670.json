    "description": "Source 1\n“I have long dreamed of buying an island owned by no nation whatsoever and of establishing the World Headquarters of the Dow company there, on the truly neutral ground of such an island, beholden to no nation or society. If we were located on such truly neutral ground, we could then operate in the United States as U.S. citizens, in Japan as Japanese citizens, and in Brazil as Brazilians rather than being governed primarily by the laws of the United States. We could even pay any native workers handsomely to move elsewhere.”\nCarl. A. Gerstacker, chairman of the Dow Chemical Company, a United States corporation, speech before the White House “Conference on the Industrial World Ahead,” 1972\n\nSource 2\n“I was asked the other day about United States competitiveness in the world economy. I replied that I don’t think about it at all. We at NCR think of ourselves as a globally competitive company that happens to be headquartered in the United States.”\nGilbert Williamson, president of NCR Corporation, a United States technology company, interview with the New York Times, 1989",
