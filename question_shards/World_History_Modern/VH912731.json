    "description": "“Concerning his greatest project, the Selimiye imperial mosque, Sinan himself said this:\n‘Sultan Selim II [reigned 1566-1574] ordered the building of a great mosque in the city of Edirne. I, Sinan, his humble servant, prepared for him a design showing four minaret towers, each standing at one of the four corners of an enormous central prayer hall topped by a great dome. Each of the four minarets had three balconies, with separate staircases leading to each balcony. Previously only one Ottoman mosque had a minaret with three balconies, and its one minaret is like a thick tower. But the minarets I designed for Sultan Selim’s mosque are slender and elegant. The difficulty of putting three staircases in such slender structures should be obvious to anyone.\nThose among the Christians* who consider themselves architects used to say that no building can ever be covered by a dome that is larger than that of the Christian church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. They used to claim that no Muslim architect would ever be able to build a mosque whose dome even approaches in size that of the Hagia Sophia. Yet in the Selimiye mosque, with the help of God and with the support of His Majesty the Sultan, I was able to build a dome that is about 10 feet higher and 6 feet wider than the dome of the Hagia Sophia.’”\n*Sinan himself was born into an Ottoman Greek Christian family, but was converted to Islam when he began training for government service as a young boy.\nSai Mustafa Chelebi, Ottoman court official, biography of the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, written circa 1600",
