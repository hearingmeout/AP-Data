    "description": "“I believe in you, Christ the worker,\n light of light and true only-begotten son of God.\n I believe that you were martyred on the cross,\n by Pilate* the Roman imperialist, malicious and soulless.\n I believe in you, my companion, the Human Christ, the worker Christ,\n Conqueror of death, who with immense sacrifice, created the new man for liberation.\n You are resurrected in each arm that is raised\n to defend the people from exploitative rule,\n because you are alive on the ranch, in the factory, in school;\n I believe in your fight without let up,\n I believe in your resurrection.”\n\nCarlos Mejía Godoy, Nicaraguan poet, “Creed,” part of a collection of poems titled The Nicaraguan Peasant’s Mass, 1979From Religion in Latin America: A Documentary History.
