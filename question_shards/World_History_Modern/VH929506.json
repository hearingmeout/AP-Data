    "description": "“Italians establish everywhere in Argentina the types of businesses in which they are employed in Italy: a pasta factory, a distillery, a sawmill, a lime furnace. Indeed, our compatriots engage in all types of industries and trades. Some are money brokers, some are blacksmiths, some are jewelers, some build houses, some are mechanics, and some are mill owners. In the rural districts, many people engage in multiple trades. Our immigrants in these areas might at once be a blacksmith and a shoemaker, a cook and a tailor, or a porter and a bricklayer. Our immigrants are willing, gracious, happy, and always trusting in a better future.”\nGiosuè Notari, Italian ambassador in the city of Córdoba in Argentina, report to the Italian government describing the state of Italian immigrants in the city and province of Córdoba, 1905",
