    "description": "“By 1830 an English textile worker was already producing with his mechanical spinning machine 350 to 400 times as much yarn per hour as an Indian craftsman with his traditional spinning wheel. The consequences for Indian textile production were fatal. In 1814 India imported one million meters of English textiles, in 1820 it imported 13 million and in 1890 more than two billion. British rule in India gave the British manufacturers free rein and made the protection of indigenous producers impossible. It stands to reason that Karl Marx condemned the driving force behind British expansion in India by calling it the ‘millocracy’ [meaning rule by the owners of textile mills]. . . .\nTo be sure, the immense productivity of English textile workers from the early nineteenth century on made this branch of British industry superior to all of its former competitors, colonial and noncolonial alike. But while other countries could shield themselves from this danger by introducing protectionist tariffs, such protection did not exist in the British colonies. So here, in the case of the destruction of Indian textile industry, we see the importance of the colonial situation, namely the colonies’ political dependence on the West, in arresting their economic development.”\nHenk L. Wesseling, Dutch historian of colonial South and Southeast Asia, The European Colonial Empires, 1815–1919, book published in 2003",
