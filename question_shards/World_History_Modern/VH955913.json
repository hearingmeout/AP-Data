    "description": "“In the course of the fifth year [1519] the terrible pestilence began. First there was a cough, then blood. The number of deaths at this time was truly terrible.\nIn 1520 the pestilence spread. Truly, the number of deaths among the people was terrible and the people could not escape from the pestilence.\nIn 1521 my father, King Hunyg, died. The elders and the priests died alike from the pestilence. Half the people threw themselves into the ravines to escape it. The oldest son of the king died at the same time as well as his young brother. Thus, our people became poor.\nIn 1524 the Spanish arrived in our country and destroyed our people. The Spanish conquered all the towns.\nIn 1542 Dominican friars arrived from Mexico, and they taught us the Doctrine of Christ in our language. Until that time we had been ignorant of the word and the commandments of God.\nIn 1560 the pestilence that had formerly raged among the people returned again. It was truly terrible when this death was sent among us by the great God. Many families disappeared. All here were soon attacked, and I was also attacked with the disease.”\nHistorical chronicle of the Maya Kaqchikel people, composed and edited by different members of the Maya political elite in the Kaqchikel language, circa 1571–1604",
