    "description": "“It is widely accepted that the rise of the Mongol Empire greatly expanded trade and the circulation of goods. . . . Since the fall of the Uighur Empire [in the ninth century], Mongolia was a region removed from the main trade routes. Thus the Mongols irrupted into the wider world as a relatively unknown society. As the Mongol Empire dominated Eurasia, envoys, merchants and travelers came to the court of the Mongols . . . and participated in . . . the exchange of goods, ideas, technology and people precipitated by the Mongol conquests.”\nTimothy May, United States historian, academic article, 2016",
