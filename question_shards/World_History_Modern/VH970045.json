    "description": "“By the end of the nineteenth century, Germany had advanced beyond Britain in terms of economic output. The prime reason for this development was that Germany developed newer industries, while Britain continued to stress textile production. Formerly an agricultural country, the German Empire has come to be regarded as one of the leading industrial nations of the world and, in the chemical industries, Germany has for some time occupied a leading place.\nOne of the most successful chemical and pharmaceutical firms in Germany is the Bayer company. Bayer employs 3,500 people alone at its plant in Leverkusen,* and the factory is so gigantic that all of these people are barely noticed when a visitor tours it. The laboratories are arranged very much in the same manner as the university laboratories in Britain. Each workstation receives a supply of electricity, compressed air, steam, and hot and cold water. The research chemists are paid a salary of about 100 British pounds for the first year. If a chemist has shown himself to be useful in his first year, he may receive a longer contract and may receive royalties on any processes that he invented.”\n*a city located in west-central Germany near Cologne; until the development of the German chemical industry in the late nineteenth century, Leverkusen was a small rural community.\nHarold Baron, British historian, book describing the chemical industry of Europe, published in 1909",
