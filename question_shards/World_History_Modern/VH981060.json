    "description": "“[TASS News Agency]: How is the United Nations Security Council decision on the rapid withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo being fulfilled?\n[Patrice Lumumba]: Belgium has already proved that she has no respect for Security Council decisions. The Belgian government is continuing its aggressive actions and savage reprisals against our people who seek their independence from Belgian rule. These facts are not widely known in the world because the Belgian colonialists have got the press of other Western countries to write as little as possible about the actions of Belgian soldiers in the Congo.\n[TASS News Agency]: What is the Congolese people’s view of the Soviet Union’s stand on the Congo’s struggle to attain genuine independence and territorial integrity?\n[Patrice Lumumba]: The Soviet Union was the only great power whose stand conformed to our people’s will and desire. That is why the Soviet Union was the only great power that has all along been supporting the Congolese people’s struggle with weapons and military advisors, while the West similarly supports Belgium. I should like to convey the heartfelt gratitude of the entire Congolese people to the Soviet people.”\nPatrice Lumumba, leader of Congolese independence movement, interview with the Soviet news agency TASS, July 1960",
