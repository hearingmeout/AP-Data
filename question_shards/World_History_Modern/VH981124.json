    "description": "“When the proposal to proclaim the equality of races was rejected by the Peace Conference at Versailles, Viscount Makino, the Japanese representative, made it known that Japan would reintroduce the proposal.

Japan codified her laws, and reformed her police and judicial systems, her military and naval forces, thus placing herself almost on an equal footing with that of the European countries.\nSome whites regard the development of Japan as an unjustifiable encroachment upon their own rights. It is, of course, true that there are still peoples in this world who are so backward in civilization that they cannot at once be admitted into the international family on an equal footing. What they need is proper guidance and direction. When they have reached a certain stage of civilization, they should be given an equal place and rank in the family of nations. Although most Asiatic nations are fully peers of European nations, yet they are discriminated against because of the color of the skin. The root of this discrimination lies in the perverted feeling of racial superiority entertained by the whites. If the present situation continues, there is every likelihood that the peace of the world will be endangered.”\nOkuma Shigenobu, Japanese member of parliament and former prime minister, “Illusions of the White Race,” article published in a Japanese journal, Tokyo, 1921",
