    "description": "“It was my privilege to attend the All African People’s Conference held in Ghana. The conference was significant because it brought together the most representative gathering of African leaders ever assembled. There were about 300 delegates representing some 65 organizations coming from 28 African countries. Of the nine independent African countries only one, Sudan, was not represented.\nThe nationalist organizations were represented by their top leadership. Therefore, whether the colonial powers like it or not, the decisions of the conference must be taken with some seriousness. The conference announced clearly that African freedom and independence are a necessity, and that the struggle to achieve independence would continue. The conference’s declaration on colonialism and imperialism significantly called upon ‘the independent African states to render maximum assistance by every means possible to the dependent peoples in their struggle.’ The final decision of the conference was to commend nonviolent methods but also to endorse other methods if they are deemed necessary.\nPresently, there is negligible Russian influence in Africa. Nevertheless, this influence will grow unless the problem of racism in the multi-racial areas of Africa is solved. It is my opinion that American influence will decline steadily unless the United States is much more vocal in its support of responsible movements for independence in Africa. The United States does not need to be as cautious as it currently is.”\nGeorge M. Houser, president of the American Committee on Africa, a nongovernmental organization founded to support nonviolent African independence movements, report about the All African People’s Conference held in Ghana, 1958",
