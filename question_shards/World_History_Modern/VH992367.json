    "description": "“According to certain information, the United States State Department, through its ambassadors, notified the governments of Latin American countries that they can expect changes in the situation in the Caribbean basin ‘if Castro’s government does not come to its senses.’ More probably, in the near future the United States, using the pretext of an allegedly growing threat to the Western Hemisphere, will embark on a long process of increasing the pressure on governments of the Latin American countries to work out additional sanctions against Cuba. One can also assume that the most wildly aggressive powers in the United States (the Pentagon, Cuban dissidents, and others) will continue to exert pressure on President Kennedy in order to realize the most decisive actions against Cuba.\n\nThe Cuban leadership believes, however, that the main guarantee of the development of the Cuban Revolution under conditions of possible direct American aggression is the readiness of the Soviet government to provide military assistance to Cuba.”\n\nAleksandr I. Alekseev, Soviet ambassador to Cuba, telegram to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, September 7, 1962",
