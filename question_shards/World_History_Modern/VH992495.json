    "description": "“1. Every Hutu should know that a Tutsi woman, wherever she is, works for the interest of her ethnic Tutsi group. Consequently, we should consider a traitor every Hutu who marries a Tutsi woman, befriends a Tutsi woman, or employs a Tutsi woman as a secretary.\n2. Every Hutu should know that our Hutu daughters are more suitable and dutiful in their roles as women, wives, and mothers of the family. . . .\n4. Every Hutu should know that every Tutsi is dishonest in business. Their only aim is supremacy for their ethnic minority group. As a consequence, every Hutu is a traitor who makes a business partnership with a Tutsi, invests his money in a Tutsi enterprise, lends money to a Tutsi, or gives business favors to a Tutsi.\n5. All strategic posts, political, administrative, economic, military, and those in the area of security, should be entrusted to the Hutu.\n6. The majority of the education sector must be Hutu.\n7. The Rwandan armed forces should be exclusively Hutu. No member of the military should marry a Tutsi.\n8. The Hutu should stop having mercy on the Tutsi.”\nExcerpt from the “Hutu Ten Commandments,” a manifesto published in Kangura, a newspaper dedicated to the promotion of Hutu supremacy, Kigali, Rwanda, 1990",
