    "description": "“Compatriots throughout the country!\nWe have made concessions for peace during our negotiations with the French to end the war.* But the more concessions we made, the more the French colonialists were determined to maintain their control over Vietnam despite their promises.\nNo!\nWe would rather sacrifice everything than lose our country and return to slavery.\nCompatriots! Rise up!\nMen and women, old and young, regardless of religion, political parties, or nationalities, all the Vietnamese must stand up to fight the French colonialists to save the Fatherland. Those who have rifles must use their rifles. Those who have swords must use their swords. Those who have no swords must use their spades, hoes, and sticks. Everyone must endeavor to oppose the colonialists and save their country.\nSoldiers, self-defense guards, militiamen!\nThe hour of national liberation has struck! We must sacrifice to our last drop of blood to save our country. We must be ready to endure any hardship. With the determination to sacrifice, victory will be ours!\nLong live an independent and unified Vietnam!\nLong live the victorious resistance!”\n*In 1945 Ho Chi Minh proclaimed an independent republic of Vietnam and war with France broke out in 1946.\nHo Chi Minh, Vietnamese political leader, appeal to the Vietnamese population, 1946",
