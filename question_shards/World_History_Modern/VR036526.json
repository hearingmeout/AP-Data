    "description": "“Inner [and Central] Asia have long been seen as a zone of contact and transmission, a lengthy conveyor belt on which commercial and cultural wares traveled between the major civilizations of Eurasia. The nomads had an essential but largely unacknowledged role in this cultural traffic. While nomadic empires had as their primary objective the control and exploitation of sedentary subjects, their secondary effect was the creation of numerous opportunities for cross-cultural contact, comparison, and exchange.\n\nIndeed, although nomads are normally included in the analysis of the political context of trans-Eurasian exchange, they are typically left out of the cultural equation. Here the great sedentary civilizations are placed at center stage, particularly when scientific and cultural transfers are under consideration. But, as we have seen, pastoral nomads were the chief initiators, promoters, and agents of this exchange between East and West [in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries].”\n\nThomas Allsen, historian, Culture and Conquest, 2001\n\nReprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press.",
