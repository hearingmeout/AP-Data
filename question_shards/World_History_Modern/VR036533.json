    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period after 1900, the role of the state in the economy varied, with many states adopting policies to control or manage their economies. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in this time period.",
