    "description": "“The Jiaqing emperor asked the governor Sun Yuting: ’Is Britain wealthy and powerful?’\nSun Yuting responded, ‘Britain is larger than other European countries and is, therefore, powerful. But its power comes from its wealth, which is derived from China. This country is allowed to trade at the port of Canton. It exchanges its goods for our tea. It then resells the tea to Europe and to its colonies in the West, thus becoming wealthy and powerful. Yet, tea is as important to the West as rhubarb is to Russia. If we put an embargo on tea exports, Britain will fall into poverty and its people into sickness. How powerful, then, could Britain possibly be compared to China?’”\nSun Yuting, governor of the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, autobiographical account of his conversation with the Jiaqing emperor of the Qing dynasty, early nineteenth century",
