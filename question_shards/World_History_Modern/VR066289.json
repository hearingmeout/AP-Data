    "description": "“I read with interest the recent article in your newspaper entitled ‘Should a Woman Demand All the Rights of a Man?’ In my view, to answer that question correctly, we first need to examine the roles of men and women in civilization—especially modern civilization—because what may have been true in ancient times no longer applies in our present situation.\nModern civilization has moved beyond the condition of the past because society is no longer characterized by roughness and reliance on physical power. Victory no longer goes to him who was the strongest, the best able to endure hardship, or committed the most atrocities.\nBy contrast, the basis of our modern civilization is good upbringing and the refinement of morals through the development of literary knowledge, courtesy, and compassion for the oppressed, all of which women are better at. So all our doctors and scientists who exalt man’s strong muscles, his wide skull, his long arm-to-body ratio and the like, miss the point entirely. Those physical facts, while undeniable, no longer grant man preference over woman in modern civilization.”\nLetter from an anonymous female reader to the Egyptian journal Al-Hilal, 1894",
