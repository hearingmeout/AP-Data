    "description": "“On May 21, 1987, exactly a week after the elected government of Fiji* had been ousted in a military coup . . . a huge bused-in crowd of ethnic Fijian men and women sat on the lawn across the Civil Center in the capital city, clapping and singing, while the Royal Fiji Military Forces band played ‘Onward Christian Soldiers.’ Across the park, another crowd of Indo-Fijian men and women and children watched apprehensive, bewildered, frightened. . . . The coup-maker, Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, an ethnic Fijian, appeared on the balcony. . . . With both fists punching the air, he addressed his supporters, ‘ [Ethnic] Fijians must rule Fiji: that is God’s wish.’\nTen years later, Prime Minister Rabuka, now a mellowed, greyer, balding man, addressed a multiracial election rally: ‘You cannot build a nation up by tearing each other down. That is why we focus on the need for us to be united—the indigenous Fijian people, [as well as] the sons and daughters and grandchildren of those who came as indentured laborers [from India], or in the following waves of business people are all inextricable parts of the new Republic of the Fiji Islands.’”\n*the Fijian general elections of 1987 had brought to power a government dominated by political parties associated with Fiji’s ethnic Indian community. Many ethnic Fijians resented the election results.\nBrij Lal, Fijian historian of Indian ethnicity, article published in an academic journal, 2000",
