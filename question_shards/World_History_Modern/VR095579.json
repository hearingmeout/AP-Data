    "description": "“Many [Ottoman] Sunni religious scholars have labeled the Sufi whirling rituals* as ‘dancing,’ and have pronounced them forbidden, branding those who approve of them as infidels. The Sufis counter that these rituals are not dancing, arguing instead that they enliven the soul through a combination of music and movement, which, they say, allows them to focus on the spiritual aspects of religion. The common people flock to the Sufis, giving them offerings and gifts. Since their whirling rituals play a big part in their popularity, they will not abandon these practices anytime soon. The Sunni scholars have written many tracts and opinions against them . . . and this tug-of-war between the two parties has brought them into a vicious circle.”\n*religious observances practiced by some Sufis in the Ottoman Empire\nKatip Çelebi, Ottoman official, The Balance of Truth, philosophical and scientific treatise, 1656",
