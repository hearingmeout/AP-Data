    "description": "1. Scientists have reached general agreement in recognizing that mankind is one: that all men belong to the same species, Homo sapiens. . . .\n10. The scientific material available to us at present does not justify the conclusion that inherited genetic differences are a major factor in producing differences between the cultures and cultural achievements of different peoples or groups. . . .\n14. The biological fact of race and the myth of “race” should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes “race” is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth of “race” has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering.\nA. According to present knowledge there is no proof that the groups of mankind differ in their innate mental characteristics, whether in respect of intelligence or temperament.\nB. There is no evidence that race mixture as such produces bad results from the biological point of view.\nC. All normal human beings are capable of learning to share in common life, to understand the nature of mutual service and reciprocity, and to respect social obligations and contracts.\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), statement about the “science of race,” 1949",
