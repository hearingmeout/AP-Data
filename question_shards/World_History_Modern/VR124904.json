    "description": "“It is not surprising that your nation [Japan] considers it its mission to unite and lead Asia. The European nations, for all their differences, are united like a single country in their attitude towards the non-Europeans. If, for instance, the Mongolians threatened to take a piece of European territory, all the European countries would make common cause to resist them.\nBut Japan cannot stand alone. She would be bankrupt in competition with a united Europe, and she could not expect support in Europe. It is natural that she should seek it in Asia, in association with a free China, Thailand, and, perhaps, in the ultimate course of things, a free India. An associated Asia would be a powerful force. Of course, that is to look a long way ahead, and there are many obstacles in the way, notably the absence of a common language and the difficulty of communication. But—from India through Thailand to Japan—we are, I believe, kindred peoples, having in common possession so much religion, art, philosophy.”\nRabindranath Tagore, Indian poet and Nobel Prize in Literature recipient, excerpt from a speech given while on a tour of Japan, 1916",
