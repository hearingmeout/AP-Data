    "description": "Source 1:\n“Any attempt on our part to improve nutrition in Gambia by increased cultivation of foodstuffs will no doubt have to come at the expense of the cultivation of cash crops and would therefore have the adverse economic consequence, in the early stages, of reducing the revenue of the colony. It is hoped, however, that this would be offset by an improvement in the health of the people, leading in time to increased strength and activity which might encourage Gambian farmers to cultivate both more extensively and more intensively than they do at present, resulting ultimately in greater production of cash crops.”\nLetter from the British governor of the West African colony of Gambia to the British Committee on Nutrition in the Colonial Empire, 1936\n\nSource 2:\n“Improvements in nutrition in Kenya must, as a matter of greatest importance, involve efforts to educate African women, to whom falls the care of the home and children. The African housewife is no less a creature of domestic habits and prejudices than her European counterpart, and her support has to be enlisted if progress is to be made in any of the activities surrounding nutrition. She plays a predominant part in such matters, being in most cases the cultivator as well as the cook.”\nLetter from a Kenyan medical officer to the British Committee on Nutrition in the Colonial Empire, 1937",
    "question": "Which of the following late-twentieth-century developments most directly helped resolve the dilemma (expressed in Source 1) between producing enough food and producing cash crops to grow the economy?",
