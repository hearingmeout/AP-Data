    "question": "In the period circa 1200–1450, scientific and technological advances in Afro-Eurasia occurred both through new discoveries and through diffusion across cultures in areas of increased interconnections, such as the Silk Roads and the Mediterranean. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which cross-cultural connections were the leading factor behind scientific and/or technological advances in Afro-Eurasia during this period.",
