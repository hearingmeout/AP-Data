    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: Sultan Abdulmejid I, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, Tanzimat Reform Edict, 1856.\n\nAll the subjects of my empire regardless of their religion shall be received into the civil and military schools of the government, if they pass the necessary examinations. Every religious community is authorized to establish its own public schools of science, art, and industry.\n\nSteps shall be taken for the formation of banks and other institutions, to effect reform in the monetary and financial system, and to create funds to be employed in increasing the sources of material wealth.\n\nSteps shall be taken for the building of roads and canals to increase the facilities of communication. Anything that can impede commerce or agriculture shall be abolished.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Aliqoli Mirza Qajar, prince of the ruling dynasty of Iran, who served as minister of sciences and education, editorial in the official government newspaper, 1859.\n\nHis Majesty, the Shah [Emperor] of Iran, decided to bring from Europe qualified teachers in all the sciences and industries and establish the School of the Sciences in Tehran.\n\nWithin only a few years of its establishment, the school has produced wonderful results. Its mathematics and engineering students are already much better prepared than students trained according to the traditional methods. The same is true for medicine and surgery, and the rest of the useful sciences, like physics, the telegraph, artillery, and the building of telescopes.\n\nNonetheless, because observing the traditions of national culture is of the highest importance, out of respect for God’s Law, the students in the School of Sciences are also being instructed in Persian literature, Arabic, and matters of religion such as prayer and fasting.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Mehmet Tahir Münif, Ottoman statesman, head of the translation office, “Comparison between knowledge and ignorance,” editorial published in the reformist journal Origin of the Sciences, Istanbul, 1862.\n\nJust as an uneducated individual is inferior to an intelligent one, so a comparison might be drawn between states that refuse to apply modern civilization and those that do. Consider what happened in China a few years ago.* Around twenty thousand Europeans easily defeated the Chinese state. The Chinese emperor was angry, but he only had himself to blame because his military was ignorant of new technological warfare. Had the Chinese not stubbornly insisted on preserving their civilization, they would not have been subjected to humiliation by foreigners.\n\n*a reference to the Second Opium War and the European military expedition (1860) that entered Beijing and forced the Qing government to make major concessions\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Mehmet Saffet Pasha, Ottoman ambassador to France, former grand vizier (prime minister), letter to the Ottoman ambassador to the Habsburg Empire, 1879.\n\nThe Albanians have announced to the world that they want their own country* and, if we don’t grant their demands, they will make their case to Europe, which has shown itself to be an advocate for our European minority subjects.\n\nThe truth is that unless the Ottoman Empire enters into the road of reform and accepts the civilization of Europe in its entirety—proves herself to be a reformed and civilized state—we will never free ourselves from European intervention and interference and will lose our prestige, our rights, and even our independence. We will decline in importance and become powerless just like another Persia.\n\n*In 1878, a group of Albanian notables had demanded greater autonomy within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: The Boat of Purity and Ease, a luxurious marble pavilion at the Qing Summer Palace in Beijing, rebuilt by the Empress Cixi in 1893.\n\nPublic Domain\n\nThe empress was accused of embezzling the funds to rebuild the structure by convincing the treasury that the money would be used to build a modern navy. The Summer Palace was only open for use by the royal family.\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: Ye Dehui, Chinese government official and scholar of classical Chinese literature, letter to fellow scholar Pi Xirui, circa 1895.\n\nScholars who enjoy Western learning* are trying to break the boundary line between barbarian and Chinese and combine the civilization of China with that of foreign countries, but I can never agree with them. Foreigners treat a weak nation like a piece of meat to be eaten. It is not surprising that they, being of a barbarian race, are hostile to us. I am surprised that our own so-called progressive scholars seem to enjoy our misfortune and agree with the foreigners. Such scholars disregard the fact that their grandfathers and fathers were subjects and officials of China, and that their sons and grandsons will be Chinese citizens.\n\n*a reference to the adoption of European scientific and military knowledge, which was a key part of the reformers’ proposals\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Sergei Witte, Russian government minister, “On the Tasks for Economic Policy,” budget report to Tsar Nicholas II, 1900.\n\nIf a country is not rich in its own capital and both the state and industry need it urgently, then there is no other solution to the situation but to attract capital from abroad.\n\nBut if this foreign capital is directed to the development of national industry, then national industry also benefits from more experienced, knowledgeable and risk-taking foreign entrepreneurialism.\n\nOur need for state credit can be satisfied more safely from domestic savings. With our limited amount of domestic capital, with the necessity of spending a significant part of the national savings on state needs, especially on increasing our war readiness and the extension of the rail network the growth of our industry can happen only with direct help from foreign investment.\n\nOnly then can mass industry develop here and lead to lower prices, increasing internal consumption, and expanding exports.",
