    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: Sultan Abdulmejid I, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, decree initiating the Tanzimat reform movement, 1839.\n\nIn the last 150 years our former strength and prosperity have changed into weakness and poverty. We deem it necessary to introduce new legislation to achieve effective administration of the Ottoman government.\n\nFrom now on, every defendant shall be entitled to a public hearing. Everyone shall have the right to own property of every kind and to buy and sell it freely. We grant perfect security to all the religious groups of our Empire in their lives, their honor, and their properties.\n\nPolicy decisions must be taken by majority vote. Everyone participating in government councils can express his ideas and give his advice freely.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Joseph Hekekyan, Ottoman Armenian engineer, recruited as a technician in the cotton mills built by the Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali Pasha, private diary entry, 1843.\n\nOne of Muhammad Ali’s advisors had proposed to substitute poor Egyptian peasants instead of oxen to turn the Pasha’s cotton machinery because the cost of maintaining an ox was equal to that of five men. The Pasha ordered that peasants be forcefully drafted to work the cotton machines. They are paid a piastre [Egyptian currency] per day, but half of it is given in bread rations and the other half is withheld because of imaginary “deficiencies” in their work. And this is being done at a time when a peasant can make five piastres a day working the fields. It is no wonder that many peasants fear being drafted to work at the cotton mills and would go to great lengths to avoid it.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Woren, Confucian scholar, Grand Secretary to the Qing court, presenting his case in a debate over reform, Beijing, 1867.\n\nFrom ancient to modern times, I have never heard of anyone who could use [Western] mathematics to raise a nation from a state of decline or to strengthen it in time of weakness. The Chinese Empire is so great that one should not worry that our men lack talent or ability. If astronomy and mathematics have to be taught, there is no need to hire foreigners—an extensive search within China should find someone who has mastered these sciences.\n\nOur scholars should clearly explain Confucian principles to the people. If these brilliant scholars have to change from their regular course of studies to follow the barbarians, then the correct spirit will not be developed, and the evil spirit will become stronger.\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Xue Fucheng, Qing dynasty government official, “Suggestions on Foreign Affairs,” memorandum, 1879.\n\nWestern nations rely on intelligence and energy to compete with one another. Thus, China should plan to promote commerce; unless we change, the Westerners will be rich and we poor. We should excel in technology and the manufacture of machinery. Steamships, trains, and the telegraph should be adopted; unless we change, the Westerners will be quick and we slow. Unless we change, we shall stand isolated; they will be strong and we will be weak.\n\nSome ask: “If China imitates the Westerners, would it not be using barbarian ways?” Not so. The Western people happen to be the first in adopting this new way of life, but how can we say that they alone should monopolize the secrets of nature? And how do we know that a few decades later China may not surpass them?\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: Aleksei Kivshenko, Russian artist, print of Tsar Alexander II reading his 1861 Emancipation Decree, which ended serfdom in the Russian Empire, to a crowd of peasants, 1880.\n\nBridgeman Images\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: Konstantin Pobedonostsev, government minister for the Russian Orthodox Church and advisor to Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II, Reflections of a Russian Statesman, memoirs, 1898.\n\nIt is sad to think that even in Russia there are men who aspire to the establishment of parliamentarianism; that our professors glorify representative government. Democracy assumes the capacity of the people to understand the subtleties of political science. But precision of knowledge is attainable only by the few minds which constitute the aristocracy of intellect; the masses and their conceptions are vulgar. The duty of the state is to act and ordain. Without a single will, government is inconceivable. How can a multitude of men act with a single will? Such conditions inevitably lead to anarchy.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Abdur Rahman Khan, Emir (ruler) of Afghanistan, account of the economic reforms he implemented during the 1880s, from his biography, published in 1900.\n\nThe difficulties I had to face when I first opened the factories were enormous. My people knew nothing of modern inventions and machinery and were opposed to new ideas. They said I did not know that the work could be much better done by hand than by machinery. They accused the officials at the factories of being enemies of the government, who wanted to send the money out of the country under the pretense of buying machinery. I was tired of all this nonsense and opposition. Though it took a very long time to reap the fruits of all this spending, I did not lose heart. I continued to buy machines and had new factories built to receive them. I continue to do so to this day.",
