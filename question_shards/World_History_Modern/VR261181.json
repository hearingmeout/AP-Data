    "description": "Document 1\n\nSource: Emperor Meiji Mutsuhito, “The Emperor’s Charter Oath,” an edict published upon his official enthronement ceremony, April 1868.\n\n1. Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters of important policy shall be decided by open discussion.2. All classes, high and low, shall be united in carrying out the administration of the affairs of the state.3. The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall be allowed to pursue their own calling so that there may be no discontent.4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything shall be based upon the just laws of Nature.5. Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule.\n\nDocument 2\n\nSource: Kuniteru Utagawa II, Japanese painter, “The Tomioka Silk Factory in Gunma Prefecture [Central Japan],” woodblock print, 1873.\n\nPublic Domain\n\nThe image shows a row of women workers using machines to spin silk from cocoons, while two male managers (on the right) oversee their work.\n\nDocument 3\n\nSource: Kaiseki Sada, Japanese Buddhist priest and intellectual, “The Ranking of Fools,” printed pamphlet, 1878.\n\nThere are many different types of fools in this world, but there is no greater fool than the one who fails to use domestic products and instead demands the use of foreign imports, thereby causing day by day and month by month increasing amounts of capital to flow out of Japan and leading our country to ruin. The following are examples of such fools:\n\n•     People who abandon the use of Japanese silk and cotton fabrics and instead take delight in wearing Western clothes\n\n•     People who look down on Japanese lanterns and instead use Western-style gas lamps\n\n•     Shinto practitioners who no longer follow the Shinto practices unique to Japan, but instead respect Western ways\n\n•     Japanese craftsmen who have abandoned fine craftsmanship and instead prefer things made by machines\n\nDocument 4\n\nSource: Platform of Jiyuto, a political party formed by members of the Freedom and People’s Rights Movement, an organization of Japanese citizens, 1881.\n\nLiberty is the natural state of man and the preservation of liberty is man’s greatest duty; but if the power of government is used to oppress or deny this divinely bestowed state of liberty, then man’s right to liberty cannot be maintained.\n\nThe authorities have used their power to shrink our areas of liberty. They have prevented liberty of speech and publication.\n\nBy establishing a political party and developing a united spirit, we plan to spread the heavenly bestowed liberty and control the power of the authorities; at the level of the state, we will correct the mistakes of the government.\n\nDocument 5\n\nSource: “Manifesto to the Japanese People,” signed by sixteen armed rebels, mostly poor farmers, assembled in east-central Japan, 1884.\n\nThe most important thing when building a nation is to make clear that the proper foundation of the nation should be absolute equality. Second, is to retain and preserve both the economic well-being of its citizens and the liberties coming from their natural rights.\n\nToday we see that we do not yet have the promised national parliament,* and, internationally, we have not yet revised the unequal foreign treaties. In order to achieve these objectives, we are embarking on a course of political treason. It appears that our wise and virtuous Emperor is being neglectful of our rights. As patriots, we cannot endure it. We will assemble an army to fight for revolution, overthrow the despotic government that has made itself the enemy of freedom, and then establish a completely free constitutional form of government.\n\n*The first Meiji Parliament convened in 1889, 21 years after the Meiji Restoration.\n\nDocument 6\n\nSource: Ichiyo Higuchi, Japanese female writer, private journal entry, December 1893.\n\nI close my eyes and think quietly about today’s society, wondering how it will change in the future. If people knew what I was thinking, they might say that I am forgetting my position as a woman. However, we women live in the same society as men and are exposed to the same momentous events.\n\nPeople have become accustomed to a comfortable life and have gotten extravagant. They seek fancy customs from foreign countries and cast away our country’s old traditions. Such frivolity has spread from small areas of life to important arenas such as literature, education, and politics. And what has it gotten us? We have not managed, to date, to amend the unequal treaties with the West. I look outside and I see the [Russian] eagle sharpening its claws and the [British] lion snarling at us. Looking back at what happened to India and Egypt, my body and soul tremble with fear.\n\nDocument 7\n\nSource: Yukichi Fukuzawa, Japanese intellectual and political reformer, autobiography, published 1898.\n\nI am willing to admit my pride in Japan’s accomplishments [in rapid modernization]. It was not until 1853 that a steamship was seen for the first time; it was only in 1855 that we began to study navigation from the Dutch; by 1860 we sailed a steamship across the Pacific. This means that about seven years after the first sight of a steam ship, after only about five years of practice, the Japanese people made a trans‑Pacific crossing without help from foreign experts. I think we can without undue pride boast before the world of this courage and skill.",
