    "description": "“When the Mongols arrived, they took the great and famous city of Baghdad, filled with many people and rare treasures, a countless amount of gold and silver. They seized the Caliph, the lord of Baghdad, and brought him before Hulegu Khan. Then Hulegu ordered the Caliph thrown into prison for three days without bread or water. After three days, Hulegu ordered the Caliph brought before him and asked: ‘What kind of person are you?’ The Caliph answered angrily, ‘Is this your humanity that I have been living in hunger for three days?’ Previously the Caliph had told the citizens of Baghdad: ‘Be not afraid; even if the Mongols come, I will carry the banner of Islam through the gates so the Mongol horsemen shall all flee and we will be saved.’\nHulegu heard this and was very angry. Then he ordered a plate of gold brought and put before the Caliph. Hulegu said, ‘This is gold; eat so your hunger and thirst will pass. . . .’ The Caliph retorted, ‘Man is not saved by gold, but by bread, meat, and wine.’ Hulegu said to the Caliph: ‘Since you know that man is not saved by dry gold, why did you not send this much gold to me when I asked for tribute? Then I would not have come to plunder your city. . . . But you sat there eating and drinking.’ Then Hulegu ordered him to be thrown at the feet of his troops, and they killed the Caliph of the Arabs.”\nGrigor of Akanc, Thirteenth-century Armenian historian, History of the Nation of the Archers, describing the sack of Baghdad in 1258",
