    "description": "“The Mughal emperor is not as wealthy as he might appear because he grants some of his lands to governors, in place of a salary, on condition that they pay a certain sum annually to the emperor out of any extra revenue that the land may yield. For his other lands, he has contractors collecting the taxes. Like the governors, they are bound to pay him an annual sum.\nThese governors and contractors have an almost absolute authority over the peasantry and nearly as much over the artisans and merchants. Nothing is crueler and more oppressive than the manner in which they exercise their authority.\nThere is no one before whom the oppressed peasant, artisan, or tradesman can pour out his just complaints. This debasing state of slavery obstructs the progress of trade and influences the manners and mode of life of every individual. There can be little encouragement to engage in commercial pursuits when success merely provokes the greed of a tyrannical official who has both the power and the desire to deprive any man of his wealth. If a man manages to obtain wealth, he would rather bury it in the ground and continue to appear poor, than risk being dispossessed by the state.”\n\nFrançois Bernier, French traveler, letter to French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, 1670",
