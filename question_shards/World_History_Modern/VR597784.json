    "description": "Source 1\n\nWomen, a warning. Leave not your homes without good reasonYou may go out to get food or to seek education.In Islam, it is a religious duty to seek knowledgeWomen may leave their homes freely for this.Repent and behave like respectable married womenYou must obey your husbands’ lawful demands.You must dress modestly and be God-fearing.Any woman who refuses, receives no benefit,The merciful Lord will punish her.I have written this poem as a warningFor you to put to good use in the community of believers.\n\nNana Asma’u, Nigerian Muslim princess and daughter of the founder of the Sokoto Caliphate, poem, 1856\n\nSource 2\n\nGirls used to be exchanged for a herd of camels and goats.But the religion we learned and the Qur’an do not allow this.Today we have no need for men who sell what they do not ownAnd for this old-fashioned trading of women.First get some education and learn how to read and write.Don’t try to turn back people who have woken up!\n\nSomali oral poem expressing a woman’s perspective, circa 1960",
