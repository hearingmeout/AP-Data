    "description": "“My father moved to Bukhara [in Central Asia] and was entrusted with governing one of the estates of a Persian ruler. My father provided me with a teacher to study the Qur’an and a teacher for literature. My father was influenced by Shi‘a propaganda, and he would appeal to me to accept it, but my soul would not. In my household, there was also talk of philosophy, geometry, and Indian calculation,1Muslim scholars frequently referred to algebra as Indian calculation. and my father sent me to a vegetable seller who used Indian calculation and so I studied with him.\nAround that time my father hired an Arab scholar to teach me philosophy. I learned about Aristotle. I read the Greek geometrician Euclid and read the Greek astronomical and mathematical treatise called the Almagest. I devoted myself to studying the texts—the Greek original and the Muslim commentaries—in the natural sciences and metaphysics.\nNext I sought to know medicine and so I read books on it. I excelled in a very short period of time so that distinguished physicians began to study the science of medicine under me.”\nAbu Ali ibn Sina, Sunni intellectual and physician, autobiography, early eleventh century",
