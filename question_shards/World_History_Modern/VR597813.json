    "description": "“I read with interest the recent article in your newspaper entitled ‘Should a Woman Demand All the Rights of a Man?’ In my view, to answer that question correctly, we first need to examine the roles of men and women in civilization—especially modern civilization—because what may have been true in ancient times no longer applies in our present situation.\nModern civilization has moved beyond the condition of the past because, in the past, society was characterized by roughness and reliance on physical power, where victory went to him who was the strongest or the best able to endure hardship, or to him who perpetrated the most atrocities, such as killing people, etc., —in other words, to him who was farthest from women’s gentle nature and compassionate heart. By contrast, the basis of our modern civilization is good upbringing and the refinement of morals, through the development of literary knowledge, courtesy, and compassion for the oppressed. This is something that women are better at. So all our doctors and scientists who exalt man’s strong muscles, his wide skull, his long arm-to-body ratio and the like, miss the point entirely. Those physical facts, while undeniable, no longer grant man the right of preference over woman in regard to modern civilization.”\nLetter from an anonymous female reader to the Egyptian journal Al-Hilal, 1894",
