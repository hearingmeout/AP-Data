    "description": "“The Cold War did not decide everything, but it influenced most things, and often for the worse: The confrontation helped cement a world dominated by Superpowers, a world in which might and violence . . . were the yardsticks of international relations, and where beliefs tended toward the absolute: Only one’s own system was good. The other system was inherently evil.\n\nMuch of the legacy of the Cold War centers on these kinds of absolutes. . . . China is the biggest example, of course, and North Korea the most dreadful one, but dozens of countries, from Vietnam and Cuba to Morocco and Malaysia, have significant elements of the Cold War built into their systems of government. Many regions of the world still live with environmental threats, social divides, or ethnic conflicts stimulated by the last great international system.”\n\nOdd Arne Westad, Norwegian historian, The Cold War: A World History, 2017",
