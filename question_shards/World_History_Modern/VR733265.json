    "description": "“The Comoros Islands1A group of islands in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Africa are filled with inhabitants. The men wear Muslim clothing and a turban. The clothes of the chiefs are made of very expensive fine white linen and pinned with silver pins; also they wear silk clothes and daggers from Arabia with silver fastenings and sheaths.\n\nThe citizens do not work, but have everything done for them by their African slaves. We requested to buy some slaves but they said that there were none up for sale as they could never have too many slaves to labor on their farms or do the work about their houses. Indeed they themselves had to obtain their slaves, with great danger, from Mozambique [on the East African mainland] or Madagascar. However they keep a good watch on their slaves within their households, so that everything seems most well organized both in their houses and in the fields.”\n\nFrederick Holtzappel, official of the Dutch East India Company, journal entry from a trading voyage, 1777",
