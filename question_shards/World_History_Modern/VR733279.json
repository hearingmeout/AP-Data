    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant examples of evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. In the period circa 1750–1900, industrialization led to global economic, environmental, political, and social changes such as rapid urbanization, changes in standards of living, changes in social hierarchies, and the emergence of various ideologies.
