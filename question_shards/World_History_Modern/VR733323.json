    "description": "“We agreed to leave the coast of Peru and sail for Japan, since we knew that cloth was valuable merchandise there. So we sailed directly for Japan. The shogun, hearing of us, sent five boats to bring me to his court. He demanded to know why we had come so far. I answered: ‘We the English are a people who seek friendship with all nations and trade with all countries, bringing the merchandise that our country produces.’ He demanded also to know about the conflicts between Spain and Portugal and England and the reasons for them.”\nWilliam Adams, English navigator and merchant, description of his voyage to Japan, 1611",
