    "description": "“I got beaten up many times by the Japanese officials because I resisted changing my name to a Japanese one. Eventually, I got tired of the abuse.\nOut of desperation, I wrote to my aunt in Seoul, the one who had been an activist and had been arrested for the independence demonstration. I asked her, should I do it? She wrote back, saying, ‘Do you have two fathers? If you have two fathers, then change your name to the name of your Japanese father.’ She was furious!\nSo I held out a while longer, but I couldn’t stand any more persecution. I finally changed my name to Otake. The ‘O’ in Korean is the first syllable of the place where I was born. The ‘take,’ meaning bamboo, is for the huge bamboo grove behind our house. So my Japanese name meant that I was born in my home township, in the house with the bamboo grove in the back.’”\nSongp’il Pak, Korean farmer and fisherman, describing his experiences circa 1939–1940, interview with a historian, circa 1990",
