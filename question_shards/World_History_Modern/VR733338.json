    "description": "“The events of the past few years all over the world have been confusing and distressing, and the future has become vague and shadowy. Nevertheless, I have been attracted to Gandhi’s stress on non-violent means. The idea is by no means new, but Gandhi’s application of an ethical doctrine to large-scale political activity is certainly novel, and it has created a deep and abiding impression on the minds of large numbers of people.\nA study of Marx also produced a powerful effect on my mind and helped me to see history and current affairs in a new light. The long chain of history and social development appeared to have some meaning, and the future lost some of its obscurity.”\nJawaharlal Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, historical treatise written while he was imprisoned by the British for his political views, circa 1944",
