    "description": "“Khubilai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty, helped win Chinese acceptance of foreign rule by giving his dynasty a Chinese name and welcoming several prominent Chinese scholars as advisors; he established his court and the Yuan capital in Dadu (modern Beijing) to keep the symbolic center of rule in China. Western and Central Asians such as Turks, Uighurs, Persians, and Tibetans, however, held high-level positions in the Yuan bureaucracy.\nTensions built between [these] ethnic groups at court and Chinese officials who felt that foreigners cared little about traditional Confucian values. Some Chinese saw Tibetans as arrogantly claiming privileged status for themselves; some criticized Muslim financial advisors for imposing too severe a tax burden on the Chinese people. Nevertheless, the Mongols united China once again, and the Chinese believed that by doing so the Yuan had won the Mandate of Heaven.\nOne remarkable aspect of the Yuan dynasty was its openness to all religions. Clergy of any tradition were untaxed; and churches, temples, and mosques were left alone as long as they didn’t oppose Mongolian rule.”\nHaiwang Yuan, historian, textbook on Chinese history published in the United States, 2010",
