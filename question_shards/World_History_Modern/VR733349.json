    "description": "“In Puebla1a city located in south-central Mexico there are large woolen mills in which the laborers weave fine cloth, from which the Spanish owners make handsome profits. And those who work in the mills are still not devout in their Christianity.\nTo keep their mills supplied with labor, the owners hire people who use all sorts of trickery to enlist poor Indians to start working in the mills. Often, the poor fellows never again get outside that prison until they die. In this way, they have even tricked many married Indians, who have disappeared here for twenty years or longer, without their wives or children knowing anything about them.\nAnd although the Royal Council of the Indies has tried to remedy this evil with instructions and orders for proper administration and the Viceroy of New Spain appoints mill inspectors to address such abuses, most of those who take these positions seek only to enrich themselves and accept bribes from the mill owners. This is the usual state of affairs in all the mills of this city.”\nAntonio Vázquez de Espinosa, Spanish Christian monk and missionary, travel account, 1629",
