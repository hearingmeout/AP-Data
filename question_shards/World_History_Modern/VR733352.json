    "description": "“My Friends,\nAlthough I am not the same color as you, I have always regarded you as my brothers. Nature formed you with the same reason and the same virtues as White people. Reducing a man to slavery and keeping him in servitude steals everything nature has given him.\nThe justice of nations requires the destruction of slavery. We have shown that this destruction will harm neither commerce nor the wealth of a nation because it would not result in any decrease in agricultural production. We have shown that the master has no right over his slave; that the act of keeping him in servitude is not a property right but a crime; that freeing the slaves is not an act that attacks property, but rather it addresses a crime that should have been punishable by law. The sovereign therefore owes no compensation to the master of slaves.”\nNicolas de Condorcet, French philosopher, Reflections on Black Slavery, essay published in 1781",
