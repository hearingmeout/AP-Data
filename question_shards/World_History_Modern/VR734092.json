    "question": "In your response, you will be assessed on the following. Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least two pieces of specific and relevant evidence. Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change over time) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. Demonstrate a complex understanding of a historical development related to the prompt through sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. Global cross-cultural interactions, including the transfer of knowledge, scientific learning, and technological developments, increased throughout the period 1200 to 1750. Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which ongoing cross-cultural interactions affected trade and/or exploration during the period circa 1450 to 1750.",
